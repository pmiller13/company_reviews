I booked a car through Rentalcarscom for Auckland 273 to 1642017 Rental cost 273 with Ace Rentals in Auckland for a Yaris or similar Flight times subsequently changed and I tried through Rentalcarscom website to change the booking to pick the car up 24hrs later 2831716417 cost would go up to 625 for a day less rental
Online chat with Retalcarscom confirmed this and suggested I contact Ace direct as Rentalcarscom cannot control the costs the suppliers put on their website Emailed Ace No they could not change booking it had to be done through Rentalcarscom as the agency Back to Ace can you just hold the car in the carpark for 24hrs then happy to pay full time just pick it up 24hrs later No cant do that because it has been booked by the agency and I should contact them Bit of a stalemate Cancelled the booking Searching again on several websites Rentalcarscom still came up with the best deal and again with Ace in Auckland so ended up booking with them again but for 28317 to 16417 at 391 plus insurance Still an increase of 118 for a day less possibly because smallest car available was not a Yaris but a Tilda or similar Went back to Ace and pointed this out they did come back to me with an email assuring me that the original booking has been cancelled and explaining how to upgrade the car Not what I was highlighting at all As an expat Kiwi Im disappointed in Aces handlingbut Rentalcarscom is also very inflexible in human terms  if the system says X then X it is
Didnt fix tablet The part number of the tablet crossed to one listed on their kiosk I was told they didnt have the parts but charged me and still havent received a refund
This is not acceptable You choose a different drop off location and the system gives you a rate when you pay you are surprised to see 75 surcharge for a different drop off location that was not visble at the time of check out this is steeling
Rented a car in Cagliari Airport Upon pick up we saw that there were many damages to the car and pointed it out to the garage personnel The garage personnel confirmed the damages and showed a damage list that was very long for the car However as it was in Italian so we could not confirm the individually damages but we trusted the staff We had to return the car early in the morning after the rental period to catch a flight back There was no one in the garage but this was not a problem according to the staff the key could be dropped in a postbox
Now 8 weeks later we have received a letter from Europcar that they have found damages on the car that is not on the damage list that we have signed They want to draw more than 600 EURO from the credit card to compensate for the damages
Luckily we took photo of the car before pick up that shows exactly the same damages as Europcar claim were not there
Be very carefully with this company it is intentionally fraud 
I was really impressed with the prices I found so I decided to purchase from here But working with the website has been a nightmare Everything was easy to find and navigate but there were just so many issues with page errors and loading issues
From the day we ordered until the time we received the packages it took 2 weeks During that time we requested the tracking number through their website but there was no reply We called and their response was we emailed you that it would be delayed in which we never received it Once we received the package one of the contact lenses boxes has already been opened and another one was half opened This is not acceptable i cannot and will not use the contact lenses that are not in their original and sealed container The box is like the protection seal cap on the medication bottle I will have to throw away those two contact lenses boxes I have been buying contact lenses from many websites but none of them sent me contact lenses in opened container
I didnt really expect them to come on time but what they ended up doing is leaving my 2000 worth of computer parts outside without no notice They never notified us and left the parts outside where they couldve gotten taken by simply just someone walking up and grabbing them
They didnt deliver on time and the packaging was a mess Almost threw the card out cause it was hiding under the shipping label Unacceptable Wont order through them again
Be very aware of this company Wish I had read reviews about this company before i handed them my credit card
Returned car mid Nov and after 3 emails from customer service still no refund Just filled out complaint form for the bank to deal with it

Delayed Delivery No response to the email sent to ECCO support
Fees to collect our items was nearly equivalent to a months rent We had to pay in advance but apparently were not entitled to receive excess monies we had paid in advance Was handy at the time as we did not have time to shop around Unfortunately would not recommend as in the end we were ripped off
Products are good Shipping is slow and customers are not updated on shipments I ordered a product on 12217 It is 212 and have not received nor given any updates on the product Nor was I offered a similar product My father is now out of the briefs and trying to get something that will work has been an issue A simple email from the company would have prevented this
Do not use this car rental Although we had bought extra insurance from home we have to buy an additional insurance before they would hand over the car to us The alternative was to put  1000 because they would not accept our visa card They claimed that their computer indicated that our credit card was a bedit card despite the fact that all Danes have this card and use it as a credit card
Terrible delivery system Took 20 days Very shameful Me take money give you bad mail service Do your job No excuse
I initially had a good experience with Bravofly until I was unable to fly due to their own schedule change which was not favourable to me From then on they turned They wanted me to call them even though they had said that customer service will call you to explore options My flight was cancelled in early September 2016 They have still not reimbursed me even though they have my account details They have also stopped responding to my emails Please be warned As soon as there is a problem and they have to refund your monies you will see another side of them I am now resorting to arbitration Very sad TrustpilotPLEASE take note
The 1st Avenue dealership would not return my calls nor respond to my emails regarding a vehicle I was greatly interested in CarSoupcom did an excellent job on their part I have recommended the site to others Their partner 1st Avenue was the failing partner I would give CarSoup 45 stars

So disappointed with my order I ordered a beautiful dress and when it came it looked nothing like the photo the material was very cheap and seethrough it looked horrible was so disappointed
I appreciate being on your coupon distribution list but its disheartening how many hoops you have to jump through in order to utilize said coupon For instance I spent a lot of time finding what I thought would be a qualifying item that matched all criteria outlined on the coupon itself only to find out upon check out that for some unknown reason it doesnt meet the qualifications Although I still made the purchase I feel like this bait and switch tactic is unfair
I purchased a oneway ticket from bangkok to amsterdam I got my confirmation email first with the bookingcode etc But never got my etickets Instead i got an email saying the creditcard verification process had failed but the amount of money was already off from my creditcard balance As a student my creditcard limit is not high so after this booking i now can not use my creditcard again to purchase another ticket as most websites only accept creditcards Just HORRIBLE  there is no way of contacting them the number doesnt work from other countries
My problem with it was the fact that I payed for something and then payed more to get it engraved and when it arrived and the words wher not centered it cost more fore the engraving then the damn thing its self not happy not going to buy from there again
Salesman was not honest
This place needs better cleaning service and maintance service Cabin was not clean had a small bug problem plus every other thing is broke or very dirty Really needs work on this cabin if they expect to get top dollar for this place Not to mention how close everyone is together in this community needs less cabins an better services to get top pay for these places Rented with this company before an the cabin was top notched clean not to close an well maintained was worth every penny spent on it however this time not worth it

The basic problem with Ticketmaster Resale for Australian Open tickets was that the system does NOT let you see your actual seat numbers  row location until AFTER you pay for the tickets you can only select a section area I bought expensive resale seats for AO Section 2 18 LOW and although I agree the tickets I received were in this section they were not LOW but were Row Z last row at the very back of the section as far away as possible in Section 2 If the Ticketmaster system had let me see the actual seat locations BEFORE I paid for them I would have not purchased these seats and I would looked in a different area
I think it is sneaky and unfair to customers to stop them from seeing actually what they are paying an inflated price for until after they pay
Not happy seats were not as expected I will not use Ticketmaster again  there are lots of other online rebuy sites
Without a doubt the worst customer care I have ever dealt with agent got both my email address and phone number wrong and had to repeat my number three times before they got it right Trying to add a mobile while keeping original number dont go there almost a week and still being told it will take 24 hours was told by one agent it would be completed in 20 mins that was 3 days ago supervisors are apparently in meetings  all day every day Staff are rude and unhelpful Just left Vodafone as the reception was bad in our area and have to say their customer care service was excellent with agents constantly keeping in touch stay away from eir is the best advice I can give
Prices seemed too good to be true and they were Once we got to the hotel we were charged a resort fee that was not disclosed while booking on trivago Very disappointed
The stamp itself is a lot bigger than the typeface which means a lot of the space on the stamp is wasted Its also not crisp and clear which I dont like at all A lot of money to spend on a inferiorquality stamp
A positive note is that they carry a full range of medical supplies On the negative side shipping fees of almost 900 for two small light items makes no sense I let the order go through since I needed the gloves and face masks but will never shop here again
Impossible to contact was as expensive as previous supplier despite all kind of promises
They send the wrong order and I have to return it but I never received my money back
I keep calling them every week and each time they apologize and tell me that they will follow up and call me by the end of day
They never called

The blinds arrived within a week which was good However the quality was not as good as expected Looking at previous reviews I was expecting a better quality The blinds themselves material is very thin and flimsy and looks cheap The cord chain control and mechanism is plastic so looks cheap and is quite flimsy When changing the direction of the blinds it feels like they dont want to rotate and that they are going to break I am very disappointed

I am hopefully nearing the end of a frustrating experience after purchasing fire glass nice H burner functional and manual safety pilot After many conversations with both Starfire and the manufacturer I cannot get the pilot to work and have returned for a refund Customer service is easy to reach but rarely can they actually provide service They are polite but dont seem able to take care of my issues whether they are technical or administrative At this point I would just like to move on

I felt that the bar in the photo was misrepresentation of the product actually for sale You felt otherwise but really when you display a rare Engelhard bar and you ask a rare bar price I expect that bar not a common bar that is worth much less I bought 3 of them and you did very well on these I dont have time to ship them back I am a partner in the AllEngelhard website and know these bars better than anyone I would appreciate if you would not use bait to attract honest buyers who assume they are geting what is in the photo
they didnt deliver my order And refund almost one month later
My tank tops checked out as VIP status on my first order but the price was not taken down to Intro Price The tank tops came out to be 2499 when they should have been 1247
I love the products and you can get some great VIP deals I get VERY annoyed with the fact that I pay shipping and HANDLING charges and yet ever other time I order I get charged some form of COD charges when it arrives They need to get their stuff together on how they are shipping and applying the money I send them to cover those charges I have a couple more VIP credits to use up and then I am blowing their website to never return again
The dining table that I ordered came with the legs unbalanced Some of the legs were floating in the air while the other two were on the floor It took them over a week to come and repair the chairs When the furniture repair men came they destroyed the bottom of my chairs While picking it up to check it the nail poked my hand and I started bleeding because didnt sew on the bottom of the chair and ripped it When I confronted them they were so guilty and said that they would repair it Not a pleasant experience
The man at the desk nearly refused my request for storage because I didnt know how long I would need the storage unit Then he shows me the storage and we come back to find out we were both locked out of the building I had to stand in the cold for 15 minutes so he could call someone for the door code

They are not trustworthy and do not keep their word They cannot be held to their word When something went wrong they refused to make it right I would never recommend this company Rude and inconsiderate

Fabletics offers and advertises their great promotions like 2 for 24 leggings and 50 off your first purchase but there are a lot of strings attached In order to unlock many of these deals you have to sign up for their programs that try to charge you 50 a month which really makes the deals not worth it They also advertise free shipping but its really only free shipping on orders over 50
If you pay by laser you wont be entitled to the discount offered
Only found this out when I called customer services
This should be clearly specified when you are signing up
Still no proper competition in the market

After ordering through Marvin at Lowcals  they deliver only on Saturday and Sunday which was told to me by the Marvin crew on the phone
I could not reach the restaurant at all and on Sunday after calling Marvin and not seeing any feedback from Lowcals I received a message that they cancelled the order because I told them on the phone I cancelled although I did not
Marvin were professional but could not understand how this business works with Lowcals
I needed to order some thingssqueegees and Plastisol Foil Adhesive
I got the squeegees into my cart but when i went to click on the Plastisol it does not show up in the 5 gallon bucket size on your website I thought that I must have ordered it from somewhere else before Well I do a google search for plastisol 5 gallon bucket and your website shows up
I IMMEDIATELY call customer service to amend my order The order went in at 331my call at 338 I wait and wait until finally I am automatically sent to voice mail I leave a message clearly explaining I needed to amend my order I get a call back at 408 from customer service They cannot add my order of Plastisol which is worth 500 to my squeegee order because it has already been packed and shipped From three different states
I call Bull Crap
I asked repeatedly to get free shipping to no avail I want free shipping on this order because in the span of 15 minutes I ordered almost 700 dollars worth of stuff from you I am not a guest shopperI logged in and my address and credit card info came up immediately If your website had been correct in the first place none of this would have happened
I booked a flight from Bangkok to LA 3 weeks before departing deciding to save about 50 by booking through lastminutecom Three days later I received an email stating that one leg of my journey has been cancelled  but dont worry theyll work with the airline to find me alternative flights on a timescale of 7 days  way too long for me to go not knowing how I was getting there having half a journey booked
I called their customer service line and initially they offered me a refund for that leg of the journey but couldnt confirm how much it would be I asked them to find out and they agreed to contact me with alternative flights and the amount I would be refunded within 2 days
Two days later I received a phone call informing me theyre happy to give me a refund for my whole journey okay thats progress but why couldnt they have told me that 2 days ago They told me an administration fee of 18 would be taken from my refund I argued it and they agreed to give me a full refund
Now I am being told that it could take months one advisor told me up to 12 months for my refund to be processed I honestly wish I had never booked through lastminutecom they have caused nothing but stress and problems for me
I ordered new glasses received my glasses in a destroyed official product box The glasses were a bit dirtygreasy but seemed to be in a good condition though I decided to keep the glasses anyway but still I expected a new product in a new packaging Otherwise it just feels weird
So I ordered a vape pen 011917  hadnt received it after 2 12 wks so called in to get status or tracking info I was told it had been delivered a wk earlier I was very surprised to hear this so I advised the rep I never received the package nor tracking info and my community has package holding so if it was left by usps as the rep said sometimes happens I wouldve been notified via email and phone by my property The rep apologized and said I needed to verify 1 more time theres no package nearin mailbox or at office and complete the req forms to have them send a replacement unit if necessary I took addtnl measures to even go to post office w info rep provided to try and find my package but was told they show it as drop off and no other info available I submitted the forms as instructed and faxed them in per instructions Waited another wk like the vapor rep advised and still nothing so I called back in 0210  was told my fax wasnt received and was asked to send forms via email to rep Omar personally I emailed the completed forms and the fax confirmation to Omar who confirmed receipt via email Another 10 days go by Still nothing as of 022017 So I called Omar direct  provided in email and left vm I then called the regular cx service  I was used to and surprise Omar answers I told him I still havent received anything and he said it hasnt been sent yet but everything was sorted w the other Dept He ended the call by saying he would sent my package today 0220 and give it another wk I am shocked that after a month and constant communication from me theres still to date nothing in transit to me My very first purchase w vapor nation and HUGELY disappointed I havent quite fig Out if this is a scam or just bad business The reps I spoke to were nice but my purchase was for a product not their time to talk to me
I enjoyed excellent services of VIP communications
Could use different courier than yodel or dpd
The web site boasted that I should book direct with Kayak  what could be better SURPRISE  Kayak diverts the booking to a scam site Webjetcom This company lied saying my credit card charge had been declined delaying the actual booking of the ticket by more than two days Then GUESS WHAT THE PRICE HAD DOUBLED Theyre looking for suckers desperate enough to pay double
KAYAK needs to stand behind their offers or close their doors I checked the Kayak offering continually for several hours after I submitted my order confirming that the low price was still there for plenty of time for the booking to have been made This scam appears to be just one of many on the Kayak web site based on other reviews I see

We were very disappointed at the time we had to wait to get some Almost an hour I feel that after traveling the last thing you want to be doing is standing in line for an hour When we finally got the counter the amount of time it took to arrange the was very long They then did not have a car available even though we had booked before leaving New Zealand The information they gave about insurance was very confusing to say the leastThen when they told us the car was available and we went to the car pick up place we had to wait again as the car was not there My good comments are the upgraded us to a very good and the staff dealt with our frustration very calmly
A gentleman named Peter from Avas called me Saturday after placing my order to tell me you couldnt do same day delivery on Saturday 21117 It would have to be Monday deliver So he upgraded my simple bouquet order to 2 dozen assorted roses red pink white and yellow at no charge Then he called back after i agreed to Monday and said now it was pushed until Tuesday
So the roses arrived on Tuesday and the receiver sent me a picture Not one RED rose in the bunch But a bunch of white a couple pink and a couple peach UGLIEST FLOWERS ARRANGEMENT I HAVE EVER SEEN I will never order from this company again
The sales person was unorganized and I think he is new too I will never recommend Drive time to a friend or family  Very disappointed 
REFER TO TITLE
Received the product I had ordered and it looked great All but the engraving It is very faint not very well done and therefore relatively hard to read Frustrating when spending 30 plus dollars on engraving itself Next time I would likely shop elsewhere Also the size of the words were much too small to fit the product itself A little frustrating
Since switching to Energia  my bills have risen dramatically
the service was great but the keys dont fit
Ive been with eUKhost a long time on shared hosting Was a very happy customer in the early years  web site worked and great support In recent years using support has become a bit of a wearing experience Web hosting would be changed and break my site and Id have to spend a while convincing support that it was them who broke it
I thought upgrading to VPS might improve the situation but migration of my existing web site has been a bit of a farce with unanswered queries and the impression I get from support doesnt make me think that theyre owning my problem It seems to be a bit of  it works for us so it must be my problem
Looks like Ill be migrating it myself when I get the time

I just booked a total of 7 tickets from Geneva to Heraklion The price for one ticket was 385 CHF which gives 73852695 CHF However the amount that was taken from my Credit Card and which appears in the confirmation email for this booking is 291761 CHF it is 22261 CHF too much This is completely incorrect since I can still now book a ticket for 385 CHF from Geneva to Heraklion and I need help from Travelgenio to get this fixed How can I get this help 
Beware and be prepared to file a Norton Shopping Guarantee a dispute with the payment card issuer and a complaint with the Better Business Bureau 
The item from my order arrived defective and not matching the description on the sale page Because of this deceptive and poor practice by the seller I do not want to do further business with them The only solution they offer is high pressure upsells and seller credit which would require me to make an additional purchase They have received return of the item which I had to pay an additional 15 to ship and insure I have little confidence or trust in this seller
There is a claim of an offer to discount a different item but honestly I would rather purchase the item at full price from a seller who is more respectable and not engaging in borderline criminal extortion
I have been using flight hub for almost 8 years Booked 60 of my flights with it however my last Miami booking I got email confirmation that my flight is booked but only to received another email that is cancel I found the exact same flight again for flight hub but higher price I have never experienced this from Expedia or another booking site Very disappointed
Awful experience Held my money for 2 weeks Hostage EMAILED ME 68 times for no reason to call your number and you call it and there isnt anyone there to PICK UP took me 2 weeks to get a hold of someone Pathetic
I purchased my furniture on 128 and was told by the sales associate that I would receive my furniture within 6 days because they were waiting on the table I purchased When I called this week I was told it could take 68 weeks for my furniture to arrive and they were waiting on my sofa which I was unaware that they didnt have that piece nor was I told it would take so long I had to take my receipt to show that the timeframe they were stating was never on my receipt and I was never told verbally either Once I went in store to prove I was telling the truth I didnt receive an apology or any empathy towards their mistake Im so dissatisfied with the service Nearly two weeks later and basically being called a liar I still havent received my furniture Ill never purchase from them again
They listed misleading information regarding measurements of glasses and then refused to pay for return shiipping Kept getting generic answers from customer service who didnt seem to understand my concern Doubts about product authenticity Dolce  Gabbana logo on case seems just a tad different from the ones I had previously but cannot affirm that they are not authentic
UPDATE
After publishing this review I was sent an email with a screen cap showing the corrected measurements of the eyeglasses on the website implying they were correct all along Anticipating this kind of situation from the start I had already taken a screencap of the incorrect measurements with which I replied The email the merchant says they have sent me to correct the situation offered simply a 10 discount on the next purchase which is nothing more than the current sale the website is offering to all clients for Valentines Beware of customer service
Found customer care hit and miss on the phone never really feel satisfied with my queries also used to pay off weekly my bill with airtricity through the post office energia have not got this service disappointing will be reviewing my supplier and looking elsewhere
It was recommended to me from a friend to join Airtasker which I did and in general the site seems to offer reasonable services for posters and workers Things seem to go south when one requests support I have requested support via email and the web service a number of times and never heard back Especially with the pro service and police check The system seems well and truly broken After applying for a police check the system was unable to pay of my card or paypal I have police checks every year and work with children checks regularly so I know I am fine Then the Pro check has time limits if you need to stop for what ever reason Pretty poor effort really and have never heard back from support from either In the system to many posters seem to pullout and cancel I have seen this time and time again I think this system really needs to shape its system up a bit the idea is great the implementation a touch dodgy
Poor unacceptable purchase very misleading Im very disappointed Not sure if I will make any more purchases in the future Too expensive for used books and you cant see what youre getting until after purchase So honestly youre taking a huge risk

I booked a flight before reading all these reviews unfortunately my money was taken instantly but no confirmation has been emailed When I logged into the website with my email address it said I have no confirmed bookings and no pending bookings
What is the deal here Where is my confirmation Bravofly
Deposited money won on sportsbetting on there bonuses Tried to cash out but even if I send bank statements IDcards and so on they will not cash out Worthless site do not use they steal your money and you will not get your money back
Im very disappointed with Euroflorist The reason I bought a flower was to surprise my significant other on valentines day and according to the Euroflorist website it would arrive on time with 95 certainty However it did not arrive and the entire point of the purchase was lost
This however isnt Euroflorists fault as its DHL who does the deliveries and they did say that it would arrive in 12 working days But then again if you claim theres 95 certainty of delivery I expect it to be delivered on time
I ordered two sets of monthly lenses for each eye When I tried them on I discovered that the lenses did not fit my prescription I tried another pair from the same boxes and they were a little better This tells me that the individual lenses can be of inconsistent quality and accuracy even within the same box Additionally rather than allow me to return the opened boxes for a full refund which is not permitted LensDirect could only to send new boxes Im still waiting on them Im concerned that this will not resolve the problem because my overall concern is that these lenses vary in quality and accuracy Based on this experience Id suggest ordering through your eye doctor or a more reputable source
We were pushed to buy additional insurance coverage at the counter but we refused since we opted for a different insurer online The lady employee tried to persuade us with lame sale tactics read they try to scare you off into buying things you dont need
At the car delivery I noticed several dents and scratches that werent reported in the checkout paper We urged the young lady in the garage to take notice and update our papers She did it but not completely She argued most of the damage were of small entity thus not liable of charge
So off we got wrongly believing everything was just fine
At the car dropoff since it was early in the morning and the office wasnt open yet we left the keys in the return keybox My wife and I checked and inspected the vehicle meticulously outside and inside and there were no damages except for the ones already reported After a few days on my credit card statement Ive found  180 charge for damages we have never made and we arent responsible for
I have been fooled by this dodgy company and I will not stop until I get justice
I am going to report them to consumers associations both in Italy and Spain
Their dishonest practices need to be stopped Avoid Goldcar and choose more reliable companies as Hertz and Thrifty which whom I have never had an issue
Dont give them your money and your pace of mind Dont let them spoil you holidays
Submitting meter reading and accessing my account details is much more convoluted than with my previous supplier
Very upset Clearly on the booking it said book now pay later but my card has been debited the full amount
I have tried to find an email address to email but can only find USA numbers in the contact here section of the app and Im trying to avoid a huge bill to make overseas call Email details would be nice
I did try call the actual hire company even though in a different country several times with no answer
I have found my first experience has been very poor and while I am willing to see if it improves when we actually get the car I cant help but think Ive made a mistake booking through your service sadly
Looking forward to someone trying to rectify this decision asap to avoid further disappointment
I ordered a XBOXLive 12 mo subscription The first code sent to me was already used I did get another code from them but I was asked to contact Microsoft first Too Much of a hassle to save 10 I should have just got it from Amazon as they sell it for 53 which is only 4 more than I paid at Gamecheap s for that
Customer Service s
Although their people answering the phone werent bad they werent adequately professional either Their phone system sounded like they were answering calls from the TARMAC at LAX It also took way too many tries to get through to someone However they did get back to me and eventually corrected the issue This has potential to be a good service So get it together Gamecheap
Bad You saved my card details without permission
Car was not available when I got there so I paid you 111 euro for nothing and had to pay for a taxi trip for nothing
The amplifier I bought doesnt work at all according to the instructions the amp is to close to the antenna Even with the cord stretched as far as itll go When it wasnt showing an error It didnt increase my signal at all Dont waste your money on this garbage
As a designer I was contacted by them and asked to participate in Houzz database I was talked into having a closed site where I could review my designs on their site but without the public seeing it
It ended up as a public spot where my design where incorporated with thousands of thousand rip of copies bad design lousy handiworks etc etc Of course I asked them to remove my site since I never gave them permission to post it
After that they continued to add my copyrighted pictures and designs to their site with no contact information or permission to me i sent several mails asking them to remove them but it wasnt until I threthed with legal measurement that they actually removed them
If you are a designer and want your stuff to be seen with other crap on a site that definitely doesnt care about you please be their customer
Houzz is a pyramid scheme amongst young salespersons and the company does not take any responsibility Isent there suspicious amount of 5 star ratings
California Casualty claims to be a teacherfriendly company and makes promises in which it has no intention of delivering After receiving a Quote  my wife and I decided to switch over to California Casualty even at higher rates due to the claim that they would take special care of teachers Specifically they claimed that in the event of vandalism of a personal vehicle while on campus they would take care of the situation with no deductible However when my car was vandalized and my phone stolen out of the car during school hours they demanded a 500 deductible in order for me to file my claim I felt cheated and decided to take my business elsewhere Their customer service is terrible to say the least and their promises are said without any integrity Go elsewhere if you want an honest company

after receiving my venetian blind i discovered they were too long and the slat operating mechanism was jammed when i called blinds to go they told me they will post me a repair kit for the wind up cog mechanism and instructions to shorten the blinds i said i didnt want to do my own repairs and asked for a refund on the grounds that its not fit for purpose blinds to go are refusing to give me a refund so i have started a small claim against them in the county court for the recovery of my losses
We receive an email for every action taken by the technicians and cannot keep up with them There is no single point of contact so there is mass confusion consistently and calibration turn around time is too long
Say one thing charge another with rude customer service that treats u as if they are doing you a favor Moving to another company soon
its not a buy here pay here
they ask me for more than 1000 down and monthly payments more than 400 hundred Sucks
Excellent customer service any problems were sorted very quickly  unlike my previous supplier Really easy to use online account management Will definitely be back to Energia in 12 months time

Purchased a product online and mad an error with the zip code The item was delivered to the wrong address and returned No follow investigation even though they had my email and phone  It wasnt until I called questioning the delivery date I believe the mistake should have been discovered before the product was shipped
The restaurant had a different price for delivery and one of the dishes compared to what was listed on marvin Told the restaurant to inform marvin but its not the first time wehe experienced issues like this
I talked to Flow Logic on two occasions about one of their units but never bought one My situation is not like a city dweller Like many people in a rural area my water meter is 12 mile from the house If there is a break in the supply line I need a unit that can be placed at the watermeter
I didnt feel like developing a solar power source to adpt their unit to my situation and therefore didnt buy one

We paid in full prior to departure to Gran Canaria Booked with Argus but when you get there the company providing the car is SIXT
Beware they ask you and are really pushy about top up insurance We refused having taken our own cover and showed proof of this They fraudulently then collected the money off our credit card on the day we returned to the UK

Im unable to deposit money from my paypal account The App simply doesnt work No help from customer services
I will be using other betting companies from now on
Even with an address  good local telephone contact number they didnt deliver my order They claimed they couldnt find the address I used google maps  found it immediately
Damn poor show
The order I placed was not delivered Neither myself nor the recipient received communication to advise why this was or to advise a delivery datetime I find this highly unacceptable I will not be using your services again
Website is hard to navigate bills arent straightforward why cant I get my gas and electricity in one bill
this is my order 195100478945

I thought the takle was very underwhelming I thought the value they placed on it was over estimated
I have bought a bunk bed two level bed on Jan 10th at Emob website The delivery time is stated as 38 days Today is Feb 14th more than 30 DAYS LATER and there is no bed in my house yet and no expected delivery date from the transportation company
It feels Emob takes NO RESPONSIBILITY for the transportation and delivery They only blame Hermes for an apparent system failure That has taken more than 15 days and I still have no idea when I will receive the bed What a joke Im starting to think this site is a complete scam and will look into where I can report it Especially if I dont see this review posted in their website
Below is a detail description of the facts
After many calls to Emob client service number only on Jan 27 I got an email saying It was on its way After that more than 10 days went by without hearing from Emob nor from the transportation company Hermes I then contacted Emob several times by email and phone and the only thing they said was that the transportation company was going to call me In one of the emails they even said they kindly asked the transportation company to call me the next day and I got no call from Hermes of course Two days later I finally got a call from Hermes saying the bed would be delivered on the following Monday between 131800 Guess what Today is Thursday midday and no bed has been delivered and no call from Hermes to reschedule the delivery
I still dont have my order Its 12 days after my order and they havent shipped yet I assumed they would ship the same day Im really stretching the length of time my last pair is in
Within 4 hours of my order I was and still am inundated with all sorts of unwanted emails For example sex for hire free money no cost vacations and the like I know this review will never be shown neither will a future order to vapornation
I received a product that would not work I talked with Eric at the company and he and I tried to get it to work while he read the directions and I followed them It was exactly what my husband and I had been doing and it still would not work We returned it and now we are told it works for them It was never used and sent back exactly as we got it They will not credit us OR send another product I have NEVER had such poor customer service and will NEVER order from this company again and will advise others not to use them either The very worst experience Ive had shopping and I do almost ALL of my shopping online
Response to VaporNation
The vapor nation response is not true I was not told the product was restocked I did get a call asking for a call back but I had been so upset over this that I didnt want to discuss it again I ordered from another company and got two products that worked immediately with NO drama
Basically this is one of those which gets the money disappear on the day of delivery comes back they day after with a discount voucher justifiying delay which obviously you will not even think to redo the mistake Dont waste your time Im sure there are much better options out there Not recommended at all
I placed an order over the internet two days later I got an email stating my order is wearing back order after I pay for everything I waited 3 weeks never received the product I called customer service the representative was really rude he told me that he would not send anything else to my house that two of the shirts were sent out already I never received your product I was very unhappy
absolutely disgusting service did not receive item that was 120 cant get hold of anyone to discuss few emails sent backwards and forwards but no closer to an outcome
DISGUSTED AVOID THESE COWBOYS
I have a business  cant successfully run it with rules like you have I dont think you should have rules like you do either That is why in all my travels I choose to stay at a different hotel chain
I was treated like an animal I will never set my feet again in any Home Zone Furniture Store I will make sure that all my friends family and contacts do the same
My flight from MexicoCity to Hermosillo was canceled by airline Volaris A substitute flight at a later date with an night stopover in the airport Guadalajara was offered by airline I had to cancel the flight because a connecting trip was lost Instead of clarifying was referred to low cost airline and did not help Volaris is a line company
I stupidly spent 25 on two orders back in November of 2016 that I will never receive On the bright side I paid through PayPal so I got a refund on my first order but the second order is still being reviewed by PayPal and I will have to wait until March 15 for a decision Hopefully it will follow the first order and Ill get a refund for that one too No wonder the prices are so low Most people probably wouldnt bother following up Just think of how much DressLily gets away with
The website is fine to get an initial review and location However booking says nothing about a view with the room which floor its going to be on and etc Since its our first visit to the island it would have been nice to get a hint or two about the most popular way to travel there and back and maybe some dinning reservations Its kinda like Nancy Palosis Book it and well see what we get Always nice to talk to someone to get a feel for things Very had to get a phone number for the hotel it self these days
Appartment was reserved but then the owner decided to take it during our resevation time
More than one week but I couldnt receive my order meanwhile it said that only 35 days A bit disappointed with delivery service and it costed me nearly 10euro
In November I ordered some goods on a buy tweo get one free basis and when I got the email invoice discovered that they had charged me for all three items
I emailed them and they blamed the overcharge on a computer error and did refund the overcharge
Three weeks passed and I had not received my goods nor an email saying they had been despatched so I emailed them again and got an unhelpful email saying the goods had been despatched almost three weeks ago and should have received by now and to check with my neighbours and with the Post Office in case the postman hadnt been able to deliver it
By now it was Christmas week and the package had not been delivered to the neighbours nor left in my safe place as agreed with the postman who incidentally always leaves a note saying what he has done with undeilverable packages
By now it was after Christmas and i emailed them again and am still awaiting a further reply
Totally unacceptable service I will never use them again
I ordered items for my wifes birthday I chose 2day shipping to ensure delivery before the date The item arrived late When filing a complaint they did nothing to fix the issue only blamed the fact that they received the order later First of all they were supposed to provide me with an email confirming receipt of the order which I never got Second I should have been refunded the extra money I spent to get it shipped on time I wasnt And finally after being made aware of both issues I received no compensation or even an apology
I recently moved into a new home We needed a new couch so I went to Grand to purchase one I was in a bit of a hurry as my belongings were in a moving truck Unsure of the best way to pay for my purchase the salesperson told me that I could finance for 90 days and that would be the same as cash That worked for me as my other option was to put it on my credit card I called on the day that my first payment was due to PAY MY ACCOUNT IN FULL and they had added 12 on the cost of my couch They intentionally lied to me SCAM I have three rooms still to furnish and you can be assured I will be shopping elsewhere
If you purchase from Shopbop they will not do a price adjustment Unless you are within a 7 day window from the actual order date You must continually check daily to make sure you didnt see a significant price decrease which unfortunately happened to me If you return items you have 15 days or you will owe them 10 for the return Their policy is hands down the worse out of all online shopping Jeff Bezos from Amazon is a very wealthy billionaire many times over and is screwing people left and right he owns Shopbop by giving the worst possible financial outcome to those that buy from his online site I wanted to suggest you find online shopping that has fair return policy and fair practices for price adjustments clearly Shopbop isnt one of them
I ordered 2 pairs of casual pants and they said my order had been approved and that was 2 weeks ago I have not heard anything from them in over 2 weeks Their customer service stinks and I have used them for years with no real issues Something has changed and I dont like it and will probably not use them again in the future depending upon when they fulfill my current order
Made this purchase for school and received email on January 27 2017 saying it was on its way Its now February 11 2017 and still not here I have emailed the company on when can I expect to receive this product and no answer Original email says I can track my shipment but there is no tracking information given to track it
Their shoes are of VERY POOR quality I bought a pair of shoes in two months the shoes started coming apart I had bought a pair previously for my granddaughter same thing in a few months they fail completely apart
I though she was just being rough on the shoes after buying a pair for myself I realized the shoes there are just POOR QUALITY 
Well I paid for 100 wool trouserspants and of course what I got was 100 not wool trouserspants probably pure polyester The fabric looked the same and the tailoring wasnt bad but it wasnt perfect either In the end I decided not to take it to another tailor but partly because the polyester fabric is so cheap its just not worth the time or effort
Car wasnt exactly clean Consultant was extremely polite however no very infomativeIe do i have to fuel car up before return toll beeper
I ordered a phone three months ago and reveiced an empty parcel which i declined It was send from the depot in Germany and deliverd by DHL DHL told me the parcel is send back the origin but the sender told me they have not received the parcel yet During past three months I have writen many emails but in every email I am asked the same questions over and over and I have answered these many times Even though still no phone Is this the service TinyDeal promised
My CSR wouldnt clearly understand and reflectively listen to me and with I needed and wanted out of my call I didnt get clear answers and just took the information and emails to each vendor and went back through it again with each I will not use this service and information in the future Best part of it was the legwork and time consuming process of finding something was taken over by her Didnt even use any one of the vendors but thanks anyway
I worked in call centers and she was more than interested in the required scripts and not listening to me Should I have been the subject in question I wouldve had the call pulled from management been counseled up to being terminated Youre not a robot but a human being who is supposed to act like they are because of a ticking clock
It took three goes at trying to book with Cruisefinder and as soon as we paid we were dumped
First time cruisers and a mature family of three couples
We did not know the routineso what

so sad
not good services no one fraud company in world 
apple service center is not good

this is an outfit that buys a lot of seconds then sells them as as top quality their return policy sucks because you have to pay return shipping the sizes dont match from one supplier to another ALSO YOU CAN FORGET A RESONCE TO ANY QUESTION YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT FUTURE PRODUCT AVAILABILLTY THEY CANT BE BOTHERED BUT THEY GET OFFENDED IF YOU DONT GIVE THEM A FIVE STAR RATING
I ordered flowers and balloons for Valentines Day for my daughter in Maui I placed the order a week in advance and was excited that I didnt wait until the last minute The order never showed up and when I logged online to see delivery status update there was none I called and after a 30 minute hold they told me they had no information on the order and they would check with the designer and call me back no return call and now it is the day after and still no update on delivery status they just flaked out
I bought valentines day flowers specified February 14 as the delivery day that was yesterday and the flowers still havent arrived No phone call to me or the recipient no explanation
I ordered these for what I thought was rush season and I got them in good time but they wouldnt even go on my feet The return process was fairly simple though so that was good
Was always happy with opti contacts until I got my last order and the box was smashed and contact was damaged
I had decided to purchase the extended warranty on my furniture and I was glad I did because after 2 years of owning it my love seat started peeling apart I was given an approval code to bring it in for repairs which I did on 12616 Its now 2717 and my love seat has been lost Home Zone is supposed to be delivering a new one on 2717 to replace what they lost and they told me I would receive a call on 2617 to be given a timeframe for the delivery Its 528am and I have no heard from Home Zone and I have to go to work I have no idea if my replacement love seat will be delivered to day or what time Me and my husband have purchased many items from Home Zone and before this we were looking to get new furniture for our 2nd living room but now we are having 2nd thoughts Im disappointed and frustrated with the company
I had an issue with the frame I purchased and they were not willing to work with me to resolve the matter
Charged Me an early termination fee for 3 days early Never will use them again
I recently went to a things engraved in the Burlington area I had an item that I purchased at the store engraved but while they were supposed to be engraving it they informed me that their machine broke They then told me I had to come back and get my item and drive it to another things engraved location in order to have the work done VERY INCONVENIENT As a customer it seemed like the staff didnt even care about the inconvenience they didnt even apologize
The usb drives are fine however the proof on the order showed a logo much better fitted than what I received The actual usb drives printed the logo larger and are much more crowded on the drive Very disappointed
Not sure Ill be ordering from them again
i ordered parts only to not have them ship when expected
when i tried to cancel the order they would not let me
than when they finally did ship they only sent part of the order and said they could not fulfill the complete order
the parts they sent did me no good with out the the other parts
after filing a complaint with paypal and my credit card company they want me to pay shipping to return the parts
be very careful dealing with this company
this is after ordering parts many times from them
Better companies out there who arent out to scam you Avoid

No help no warranty no answers Just trow your money away At least you will not deal with them
If you havent any trouble and you do not have to call the costumer service it is a probably a good organisation But when you call to the costumer service and they are lying into your face I dislike them We had troubles with the hotel We couldnt stay in it anymore Amoma did inform us 1 day before our trip Then they said they couldnt contact the hotel so they couldnt come to a solution But when I called the hotel they answered my phone call and gave me the solution Amoma had to gave us
Problems with credit card purchases on the site
I have been a customer of this company for the past few years and have always been happy with the quality of their products I recently placed a new order using my old file they had in their system and ended up having the entire batch printed wrong I spoke with one of their customer service employees on the phone and explained what had happened and was looking to work on a solution together I wasnt looking for a new run for free given that I had approved the proofs they sent me with the artwork Instead of working on a solution their customer service representative chose to insist that I hadnt used the file from their system and multiple times said that I had uploaded a new file and it wasnt their problem He was implying that I was lying about it I have no issues having to pay for a new order but the refuse to continue working with a company with such bad customer service They have just lost a loyal client for not knowing how to deal with a simple issue Beware when ordering their products Make sure you get everything right from the outset or you may be treated as a lier by their customer service representative

Sales rep lied promising a gift card When it didnt come I called Verizon customer service They pleaded ignorance and hung up on me My two year contract cannot end fast enough Also I did not notice any difference between RCN and FiOS
Their shipper was horrible Product was delivered as specified by Rackmount earlier than estimated but the product sat in a transfer facility for a week  because the shipper was incompetent We had to spend the money to pick up the product at the transfer facility because of this which cost the project time and money This isnt directly attributed to Rachmount but it was still a black eye on the project
The delivery company and I have been trying to reach them for 2 days for delivery of my product They will not answer the phone

Very unhappy with FlightHub They have you automatically taking flight insurance I booked a flight and saw a final price of 32185 CDN and was happy I gave them my credit card info and then after finishing I saw too late where I was charged for insuranceThis made my final bill almost 500 I think you select insurance if needed To me their set up is an underhanded way to get you to take flight insurance I could find no way to address this and cannot contact them as I am in Europe Have used them in the past and that is what it will be
I am happy to report that Flighthub has refunded the insurance cost and I am impressed with their speedy attention to my concern I will use them again and now know that flight insurance must be declined Still believe that selecting it is the correct way to go not the reverse But thank you Flighthub 
I bought ladders from Trade Tested which were faulty and therefore dangerous The staff were initially helpful on the phone I posted ladders recorded delivery but have since mislade the number
Called TT twice and was told on both occasions they would look for my ladders and get back to me which they never did Ive now gave up
In my opinion based on my experience their after sales customer service is rubbish and they lied to me yes lied I would rather take my chances and buy online from China than deal with these chancers
To any potential customers please read the negative comments they mostly have one thing in common TT dont like honouring warranties should your goods be faulty
We booked our hire car online through Holiday Autos and immediately paid all costs including basic insurance We were advised we would need a credit card in the name of the driver to cover any other costs When we arrived in Fuertuventura we collected the keys from Goldcar
The rep asked us for our credit card to pay a deposit We explained that our understanding was that we had paid all costs in full at the time of booking The rep advised that the extra costs of e20594 which were now required were company policy in regards to fuel and other damage deposit and formed part of the conditions of the booking We queried the amount as this seemed excessive to cover fuel for a small car for a week but the rep assured us this was correct and guaranteed that this cost would be refunded IN FULL to our credit card on return of the car with a full tank and in good condition We made it clear to her that we did not require any extra cover regarding insurance or fuel as we had already paid but the rep also made it clear that we would not get our hire car without this extra payment She did not breakdown the cost on the invoice and as it was in Spanish we had to take her at her word We felt we had no choice but to enter our credit card with the assurance that the monies would be refunded in full
When we returned the car undamaged and checked with a full tank of fuel we spoke to a different rep who assured us our deposit would indeed be repaid When home we received a notification of a return of Euro 9200 leaving a shortfall of Euro 11394
The situation is further compounded by the fact that we were obliged to have a credit card in the drivers name with an 1100 credit allowance to allow us to have the car with no extra cost for insurance We do not have credit cards we only use cash and debit  but did this in order to comply
Because we signed the form we have no way of recovering the money
We are extremely angry and disappointed that we appear to have been ripped off  and in our own opinion probably the rep was on commission
NO WAY was it explained to us that we were in fact paying for extra souped up insurance which we did NOT need
PLEASE BE CAREFUL BEFORE SIGNING AGREEMENT AND ENSURE ANY COSTS ARE FOR FUEL ONLY
They dont tell you when you reserve your unit its upstairs then when u do get an upstairs unit they have very poor access to it
Of the two pair I purchased only one fit Although site says use the return label enclosed there wasnt one I tried to email I tried to call i emailed again Nothing I am now trying to sell the pair that does not fit I tried to cancel subscription Although it says you can cancel I spent over 30 minutes on the site and could not find the cancellation spot NOT a happy customer
I ordered a tree online and they told me it would ship sometime between 2017 and 2020 After two weeks when I hadnt heard anything I got in touch with the orchard and asked where my tree was They told me they didnt intend to ship it for another three months I said that was unacceptable and asked for the tree now and when it arrived it was mostly dead and was fully dead within two days Do not buy anything from these people
1 Cancellation package is a scam I paid almost 90 for a flight including the cancellation package I am receiving 14 back because its up to the airline to decide whether or not I can cancel So basically the money I used to purchase the Cancellation package is the money Im getting back It is WORTHLESS Dont even bother getting the Cancellation package
2 If you have a simple question and youre in a different country you have to pay 6 for a 15 minute phone call with customer service I had to call twice because they didnt follow up like they said they would So I paid 12 just to ask a simple question
3 Every time you make this phone call you have to reenter all your credit card information which is really annoying And it hangs up on you if no one answers within like 5 minutes So you have to constantly reenter your information The Worst
In the end I will have spent 87 on nothing I am appalled
Other day they had a good deal on an item However you were limited to one I suppose due to scalpers or something Regardless it was the type of product that is useless to have just one So you saved a few bucks but they shouldve upped the limit to like max 10 per customer or 5 Something
They were fast but they wanted far far more data than your average website They keep it too You cant delete it afterwards So I guess they must sell your data
This company is a joke Horrible customer service Rude Not helpful and nit very trustworthy
Had several issues and contacted them was not given any help Then i posted a review which they reported  so im having to redo and reword it stating i wasnt even a customer I had to prove to this review company that i indeed was a customer How pathetic is that your company gets a bad review and instead of trying to make it right you try to make it disappear by falsifying information
Will NEVER EVER reccommend or use this company again
no response online cannot refund after completion
 I ordered an item for Christmas in early November  it arrived mid January
 All emails regarding this were ignored
 Despite unsubscribing I continue to receive spam from them
Matts were too big for the back of my car
La planta estaba horrible
My order was received with one opened box and with an outdated prescription I am disappointed that there is not a check for current prescription and even more upset that I received an open box I was told by phone and email that I could return the order for a refund but it would not include the opened box since thats impossible apparently I will switch distributors
I have been a customer for years and the last couple orders have just not reflected what I have come to expect from them
I hope the impending 2018 fiasco is not killing them prematurely
Called for a recommendation on a new tank to fit an existing ecig and was given a incompatible as I found out once it came model Yes they took it back no questions but a waste of time and effort
Same order bought 5 batteries sent 5 of the wrong batteries
Customer service lady who took my call got the order picker and checker from me from my order slip so hopefully it will get mentioned and acted upon
But if I was a new customer there would never be a 2nd order
Very hard to fly no directions on how to calibrate the remote better
YOU SEND ME A CATALOG SAYING THAT I AM PREAPPROVED FOR CREDIT I PLACE A SMALL ORDER 7S0157701662 FOR 3822 THEN YOU DECLINE MY ORDER SAYING I ONLY RATE A SCORE 96 AND YOUR SCORING SYSTEM IS 199 I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND YOUR CATALOG TO ANYONE
Paid extra for tracked delivery Courier and tracking number not supplied in time which resulted in a failed delivery Uber would not refund and were very pedestrian and unhelpful I hope the travel system is better than their customer service although I notice some of the measurements and details are not correct
Their service is not bad their partners are
I gave them 10 shirts and when I got them delivered back in 3 of them were missing buttons on the sleeves and on the neck When I got back to them to tell what happened their only answer was We are sorry
Instead of being sorry a good customer focused company would take them back and fix them
Never gonna use Laundrie again
This is the biggest scam going It is the first time I had my money roll over for a few months Although you billed 150 to my credit card over the last three months 50 each month I am only able to spend my money in increments of 50 So if I want to order something for 6999 I can only use 50 of the money you already took from my then I have to pay the difference on my credit card So you take 1999 more of my money by billing my credit card while I still have 100 in my Fabletics account WHAT A RIP OFF YOU TAKE MY MONEY THEN DONT LET ME USE MY OWN MONEY AS I WANT Cancelling my membership and never ordering from this website again
Using the service to call the Philippines can make you pull out all of your hair Many times it does not connect or it takes over 3 min to get a call to connect Multiple times it not only connected to the wrong number but to the wrong country The sound quality is poor except the rare occasion when it is actually half way decent The site only post positive reviews with no way of posting your own review which leads me to believe the reviews are fake or filtered to show only positives
I have bought what I thought to be last minute tickets flying to Australia from Edinburgh
2 weeks later after getting boking confirmation they noticed me of cancelling the whole ticket because of an error made by them 
Even though they tell to refund the ticket price  I havent recieved any money back yet I have paid additional total of more than 300e for connection flights and hotel I tried to write them about it but they have basically no email for customer support I tried to reply on the email I recieved but got no reply I wrote them on Facebook as the only way to reach them but got just some autogenerated text of getting to me later
I either wanted them to honor my flight as I bought it or participate on my expenses caused by their error but no communication is possible with them at all
Stay away and beware 
I dont like the fact I have to pay the return shipping on the item I purchased
Very Dissapointed to find that the rental payment was taken from my bank 8 months in advance of when I actually require the vehicle
having to make a seperate account was idioticwhy wasnt this one click simple The site behaved like it was completely seperate from ticketmaster and took me an hr to navigate Didnt work on mobile Pathetic
Cant get anyone one phone still havent received my order
I have lost a package with these muppets even though i paid 35 USD for courier services Apparently they use a private contractor to ship to the UK with NO trace 2000 USD gone Will never use these guys again Oh and their customer service is ridiculously bad as well
I ordered once on Dec 19 2016 and then on Jan 12 2017 I have not received either order I have lost money on both the orders for no fault of mine and my undue belief on eVitaminscom
I have been contacting them thru email but they have not done anything from their end
I try to call on phone and I always get a recording saying No rep is available I never get such nonresponse form other ECommerce like Amazon They have reps always available and they call back immediately when I ask them to call
This is a shame that such a nonresponsive Ecommerce company is allowed to operate their business
It is amazing that eVitaminscom replied to the review in TrustPilot in 10 hrs itelf while my emails to eVitamins are till pending for few days
What a facade
Such ECommerce companies do not belong in the marketplace who do not want to
1 Provide enough reps to answer phonecalls
2 Do not want to address concerns of the customers but just give wishy washy answers
3 Do not reply to customers enquiries for days but have time to respond to survey on TrustPilot immediately
4 When Delivery is not made they wash their hands off
Customers who got their products should feel very lucky but others who do not get it should not expect any cooperation from eVitaminscom by writing or by phone calls
I shop online a lot and the NFM website is by far the slowest of them all

I ordered a polo and used a freeing shipping code At the final checkout screen Fanatics automatically changed my shipping to expedited I move the shipping back to free confirmed my order total and submitted the order Low and behold the amount charged and shown on my order screen included the expedited shipping Tried to correct by calling the company to no avail Horrible to scam shipping fees
I went there and asked if this Person was there and was told off for the day Did my taxes and and paid 35000 Told I had to pay Had taxes checked and found out I was getting small refund after all They do not know what they are doing Will never go back I think they should refund me 12 my money back

I know that when you read reviews you have to take them with a grain of salt but this review is an honest true story and I hope it saves someone else a lot of aggravation
Where do I begin This company had such a great name and product I was so excited to build a custom fire pit for myself From that day on the day that I paid almost 4k for a fire pit it went downhill How disappointing
The errors were endless First they said it would be delivered in 2 weeks from ordering it was even printed on my invoice After 4 weeks I called to find out where it was and it took 3 attempts to even get someone to answer me Once I got an answer they said it would be shipped the next week After another 2 weeks I called again and got the same no response Finally they told me it was shipping that week When I finally got it over 6 weeks late it was missing a part that is needed to actually make it work I had to go to Home Depot and buy a 60 worth of parts gage that we needed to install for it to work
Then we realized that the propane tank would not fit in the base We tried for a while in different directions and no luck We called the company and they had the nerve to send me a video showing me a lady sticking a propane tank into the base Really So I sent them a video back showing how mine DID NOT FIT They argued with me for a while and send me to the manufacturer to discuss it with them It went back and forth for a while until they told me that there were different sized tanks and some manufacturers made them slightly smaller I knew they were wrong but I agreed to drive around town and see if we could find one that was smaller Total waste of my time all standard tanks are the SAME SIZE Finally after more arguing they agreed to send me a new base that I would have to disassemble and reassemble on my own Can I remind you that this fire pit was almost 4k
The base arrived a week later and I hired a handy man to help install it as it was not a simple project After we determined that the tank in fact fit in this base he started the process I thought things were going well and low and behold another issue He calls me outside and said there is no hole for the igniter panel I almost burst in tears Sure enough the old base had a big hole cut in the base for the igniter panel to be mounted and this new one did not I called Starfire immediately They had the manufacturer call me and can you believe what she said to me I understand you need some assistance in walking you through how to swap out your base I almost lost it on her I calmly told her what was going on and she insisted that we had the hole we needed I had to take pictures again and finally she said oh yeah we shipped you a different base you needed the one with the  So I told her that my handyman was going to try and cut a hole in it and try and make it work She offered nothing I called Starfire and demanded not only someone pay for my gage but someone pay for the hand mans time and materials On top of it I decided I wanted more I wanted compensation for the weeks of aggravation that this has caused
It has now been 3 weeks since this has all happened and NO ONE has called me back nor has offered a solution When you spend this kind of money on something you expect a certain level of customer service While the man at Starfire tried to help and tried to resolve some of the issues in the end he failed because I still have no resolve I will NEVER buy from them again and you can be sure that my voice will be heard I am an educated and reasonable woman who was willing to work with them to fix the issues and they treated me like a moron and gave no compensation for THEIR mistakes This is unacceptable and the ONLY reason that they even got One Star is that the unit is beautiful Dont buy from them
This is the worst transport service Ive experiencedever My car arrived damaged the inside was filthy from a greasy driver Complaint fell on deaf ears My advicefind someone else to transport your car
Updatethey pulled my bad review claiming Im a competitor So thats how they keep their high ratingsblame it on someone else WOW
Bought ski insurance our bags are lost so we have no skis no ski clothing no change of normal clothing not even a second pair of underwear Apparently we are covered for 100 per day However there is an excess of 70 per person so in theory we have to wear the same cloths for 4 in our family policy for 3 days until we can claim for it Also missing our ski holiday hopefully our baggage turns up today but do not purchase through this company for ski coverage it is more expensive than others I looked at and the service is very poor
Charged me extra for shipping outside the US even though I shipped to an address in the US
I have tried a few of these companies to see which is best value for money I had a great experience with other companies such as Muscle Chef they were amazing but Muscle Meals Direct meals for vegetarians and Vegans are sub par and disappointing
Protein is obviously important for health reasons and being a vege we just get our protein from different sources it doesnt mean we dont need protein
The meal quality from muscle meals direct is poor As an example my Tofu Thai green curry had one tiny piece of tofu a piece of broccoli and a couple slices of carrots and all meals are generally the same I have photos but I cannot upload here
I contacted Muscle Meals direct to try and resolve my concerns as I had spent a bit of money on 18 meals and if i continued eating these I would get sick from a lack of protein source They first simply offered me 10 off my next order
when I complained further they did refund 4055 towards my meals it doesnt quite cut it for future orders people may place hence my review
Whilst it is great they are trying to offer Vege and Vegan meals and I understand this market can be quite different the experience is just not good enough and I wont be ordering again
I thought I was purchasing seats which turned out to be general admission lawn area I could have got these from the normal tikitek site for the standard price
Just sent this to Lola So this is my first day using your product I ordered 2 boxes of super plus 5th tampon today Apparently your super plus is not comparable with Tampax in the amount of liquid it can hold and how frequently i need to change it Bled on my jeans and my shorts im 42 years old this is not my first rodeo 5 out of 5 for the applicator not working AT ALL it doesnt do anything but push the tampon out a little bit then get stuck my fingers arent long enough to reach through the hole to push it out so 5 times today ive had to pull a bloody tampon and applicator out try not to get it all over my work outfit pull it out of the worthless applicator put it in myself  wash all this mess off thank god i went in the wheelchair stall what a terrific day guys im so glad i didnt tell anyone to buy this fiasco i will tell them not to subscription cancelled
My pc has windows 10 and will not connect to the internet without trouble shooting This was advertised as the cure for my out of date network adapter
So I spent 10 and bought it It is also supposed to optimize countless other apps
Still doesnt connect to the internet and the optimization has made absolutely no difference to my pc at all
E mailed the company no reply surprise surprise
Save your money do not buy this if you want your windows 10 network adapter driver to connect to the internet because this will not fix the problem
it took more then two hours to make sure i place the right order Which i hope i did too confusing
Im sure the products available through PIckleball Central are great The selection of items is amazing but the pickleball Christmas ornament I ordered my husband this year was a big disappointment
Great price The best in fact which is why I went with it Online method of contact  no problem with that being the companies chosen medium of contact However I am gutted with the service After paying my fee online and receiving my disc promptly in the post I then received a request for my no claims cert grand  sent it off Also got asked for details of any accidents including non fault Wrote a letter detailing 3 incidents where other drivers hit my vehicle in recent years But no claims were ever made by me on my insurance and the guilty parties always simply paid up Cut and dried I would say Twice I was told online I had not provided this info even though it was in the same envelope as my no claims cert which was received Finally Im told they did receive my letter but want dates and did my company ever pay out All of this was in my actual letter which I had to post twice even though they got it the first time When I wrote an imessage to say What Theyre asking was already answered in my letter and that I didnt appreciate the messing around they blocked my account So Ill have no choice but to call which will cost 10 fee plus phone bill or cancel the policy They have deliberately messed me around asking several times for the same info So now Im over my 14 day cooling period Very clever cos guess what once that happens they take 25 of your whole fee Did I mention noone even responded to me when I messaged that Im not happy to keep repeating myself with their info requests They just went and locked my portal account Way to go there with the awesome customer service Heres the rub  neither I nor my husband have made an insurance claim in the past 16 years Any insurance company at all would be delighted to insure me and I had the misfortune to select these charlatans Never ever go with this company  the money saved is not worth the appalling experience Would hate to see what happens when someone actually has an accident I feel in my case this company are scam artists as they had no reason or evidence to not insure me
I ORDERED SEVERAL ITEMS
I SELECTED OVERNIGHT DELIVERY FOR ANOTHER 2995
NONE OF MY ITEMS SHIPPED
IT STATED UNDER 1 OF MY ITEMS THAT IT WOULD SHIP WITHIN 3 DAYS NOT AFTER 3 DAYS
I REALLY NEEDED THIS STUFF FOR NATIONAL SIGNING DAY FOR FOOTBALL PLAYERS AND FANATICS LET ME DOWN TERRIBLY

I WILL NEVER USE FANATICS AGAIN AND I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT NO ONE ELSE EVER USES THEM
FIND SOMEONE ELSE WHO DOES CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMER
ITS TIME TO BOYCOTT

Service provided but prices beyond my budget
I called in just shopping around for internet only They claimed to have found an amazing internettv combo that was as as cheap as buying internet alone If the deal had went through it would have been
After 2 credit checks  2 charges to my debit card I thought I was done after almost 2 hours on the phone I got transferred to a different person to verify my appointment for the internet installation She then claimed the order didnt go all the way through and needed another credit check I asked to be transferred back to the original person  and she sent out me in hold then after 45 mins someone answered and claimed that they had no information about any of my purchases and that I couldnt be found Now I have tv and the internet company says the internet sold to me isnt available at my house
Very upset called in 2 days in a row and nobody has any info on my orders or any record of me even calling in
We booked our honeymoon flights 2 weeks ago I noticed that my husbands flight was taking a while to be confirmed Turned out theyd actually cancelled it without notifying us The reason they claim is because we had a special request which we hadnt responded to We had actually responded to their email immediately and had screenshots of the conversation to show we had replied within 10mins of receiving theirs They admitted it was their fault However we still see no resolution They havent reinstated the flight and in the time weve waited for them to keep messing us around over 5hours clocked to their premium phone number the flights have increased by 500 Promises to resolve the situation and calling us back have not yet happened We have spent an inordinate time trying to get answers from them and keep getting fobbed off Absolutely awful company
After multiple contacts with the live chat no information as to where my product was given Once i filed a dispute with paypal dx immediately told me to cancel the dispute very suspicious as it is Delivery was estimated to be 2 to 4 weeks well its been 5 and have raised the dispute to paypal directly Extremely unorganized and just a scam Never buy from here

Its been 16 days since I placed my order I have not received my contacts I even paid a processing fee and You were happy to take my money immediately You claimed that there was a delay from the manaufacturer but that was only supposed to be 710 days You have two more days  then Im disputing the charges with my bank  canceling my order
The estimated meter readings for gas and electricity are deliberately inflated by Energia in order to take a larger amount of money from the customer Let me explain The window of opportunity for the customer to submit an actual reading is deliberately narrow in order to prevent the customer being charged a fair and actual amount This overcharging prevents customers like me from switching because we suspect it might be difficult to get the overpaid money repaid and the confusion involved may mean that customers like me are out of pocket when the account is closed off I suspect any refund to the customer of credit due will not be automatic and any refundcredit on the final bill must be formally requested from Energia This is a process which most customers find to be more hassle than its worth due to people having busy lives meaning Energia would hold on to that money under the pretense that it would be credited to the customers next bill there wont be any next bill This is a moneymaking strategy I will change back to Airtricity as soon as I get a chance Competitors are offering 150 cash back at the moment not to mention that theyre cheaper than Airtricity right now
I bought a UMI Super smartphone at 1122016 After 3 months it hasnt arrived They are not answer in emails I had to open case in paypal to take my money back
When I booked my flight everything went smoothly However I got an email telling changes have been made to my flight and I was given the option to cancel when I chose that getting my money back is now becoming a nightmare
After the oil change the car was running like a dog Took it to the dealership because its a 2016 Subaru and found out that they did not drain the oil but just changed the oil filter and added the 5 qts of oil Overflow of the crankcase oil caused my auto to stall Just want type of mechanic would do that
Ordered a pair of shoes from them took them 3 days to tell me that it was sold out they offered me a refund and they told me that it would take 14 days to send my money Communication with them was very slow They would reply once every 24 hours After a few days of telling me that the item was sold out the item would appear on their website with the stock still avalible
Took 4minutes for the sales lady to help me one was facing me the other facing her They were too busy talking
Asked where I was going it was 20 minutes from airport she said you must get gas near the airport to fill out and SHOW the receipt of course when I dropped off no one asked to see receipt
Rented compact car like ford focus says the website no focus on lot only sparks and other very small
Along with the 35000 hold to my credit card
Never again rent from Dollar
I decided trying the meals as my hisband and I work full time in very demanding jobs and Im studying as well and find it impossible to make time to cook healthy meals for the family
I liked it is not a subscription so we could try without getting tied the first week I booked small portions of the default menu and found them quite small the presentation in bags is a bit uninteresting and usually takes longer or less time than recommended to get the temperature right My daughter hated them from day one
I decided that for the second week Id choose the ingredients and make the meals I think wed like better plus ordered the bigger size
We havent been able to eat them they can be ok or totally disgusting I thought my daughter was just picky but I havent been able to eat them myself
Unfortunately I dont think this is the solution we were looking for
When starting to use this sometimes 2016 last copule of months I was very disappointed to service because always I lost my money every time always says service error but no refund also cant recharge My mate in overseas
Expensive and gives you very little time to pay your bill by  WOULD NOT USE AGAIN
my ps4 just kept saying that voucher was not valid
I planned on making a purchase with my Gettington plan and even thou the funds were there I was denied my purchase I have never been late on a payment since Ive had this account And when I need to purchase in the future I will shop some where else Thank You for all the past purchases I have made But I know you could care less about losing one customer But It cares to me
Sincerely
Robert Titterington

Purchased Windows 10 download which doesnt download directly to computer so had to purchase 4G flash drive Customer Service responses were the stock answers wordforword of what is on web site Nowhere does it say you must wipe your hard drive completely   but thats exactly what is necessary I know have Windows 10 on a flash drive which I cannot use 4000 lost   lesson learned
Ordered through Milan direct who now do not exist and have been owned by Temple and Webster since 2015
The products they stock are good website is a breeze to use Unfortunately thats where the good experience ended After I received the wrong colour dining table in December I was assured that they could exchange as long as I kept the table in the original packaging Unfortunately this turned out to be false In fact after emailing them on the 4th of January to set up the exchange they did not respond for over 3 weeks All the while I am waiting with no kitchen table to eat on and a massive box in my kitchen After 4 or 5 emails with no response and exactly 23 days later a representative contacts me and explains that they are looking into the matter Another week and a few more emails later and I am informed that due to the recent acquisition of Milan Direct unfortunately we cannot process an exchange Recent Milan Direct was bought by Temple and Webster in 2015
As of today 6th of February 2017 have been told that I will have to wait for the table to get picked up they will take back to their warehouse refund the money into my account and I will have to reorder another table from their website back to where I started in November Who knows if Im lucky I might have my table by Christmas 2018
This is the second time this has happened in as many deliveries Judging from their plummeting share price I can only imagine Its not the first time I would strongly recommend going elsewhere
ITS A SCAM they say they are legit the 5 ratings are probably fake and by them but I ordered overwatch here thinking I got a better deal and its just a scam they dont reply to any emails DO NOT BUY HERE AT ALL THEY HAVE FAKE REVIEWS
I would not recommend these for anybody to buy The quantity was very bad
I ordered a watch from jomashop for my husband for our anniversary I waited over 6 weeks for the watch to be dispatched I called several times in between for an update on my order and they kept saying give it 12 more weeks After 7 weeks of waiting i get an automated email saying my order has been cancelled due to unavailability Really It took you 7 weeks to tell me that the product was not available In exchange they gave me a coupon code for 50 off a purchase of 1000 50 of a 1000 for 6 weeks of waiting seriously Its like here you go a slap in the face
PS I even emailed them with my concerns prior to this post but they have not replied
Bought a set of mats for my Mazda 3 The mats dont fix into place It appears that the fittings are the wrong size I am still waiting to hear from the company about a refund They are very slow to resolve customer problems it would seem
I wrote an email to amend and add another guest name of my booking itinerary No email respond for 3 days later and so many time call to their call center for the last time call i got 20 min waiting and not one answer on international call OMG how does this company run the business
The towels smelled mildewed needs more blinds around the hot tub so that the old man down the hill will stop staring at us Jets in hot tub hardly worked Dishes some were dirty Fire place is barely working Then when I went to the office to get more towels She said they would bring them nobody showed up Cabin is nice but not the best experience We usually rent from Auntie Bellems They are a little pricey now I see why
MI AVETE MANDATO UN EMAIL PRESTITO VELOCE BASTA POCHE OPERAZIONI PER AVERLO  E POI HO DOVUTO ASPETTARE 15 GIORNI E UNA VERGOGNA HO DOVUTO TELEFONARE ANCHE 3 O 4 VOLTE PER SAPERE A CHE PUNTO ERA LA PRATICA SPERO DI NON AVER MAI PIU BISOGNO DI VOI ANCHE PERCHE TUTTI I MIEI DATI VOI LI AVETE GIA AVEVO UN PRESTITO IN CORSO
Bait and switch They charged me an extra 200 after I clearly chose a different drop off location
The picture shown for the product was different than the item i recived
I have had a very bad experience using airtasker and after escalating the issue to airtasker no one has called me
One of you airtaskers has taken my house keys for over 1 week after lending her a set to complete a 1 day job In this circumstance airtasker should have got involved and spoke with the tradie Another issue is that I dont have her direct phone number
I still dont have my set of keys back and still no call from airtasker
I tried contacting them numerous times to cancel my service I was trying to cancel within the 24 hour period as well The problem is my server was never even set up and because it was still Pending there was no option to cancel All tickets were responded with the link to their cancelation steps which didnt apply to my case Hoping I wont be charged for the month now as Ive tried cancelling from hour one and its taken 3 days for them to contact me with horrible information Extremely unprofessional
Order has been delayed in shipping because my credit card needed validation No email was sent asking for validation until I emailed asking where my shipping details were They then emailed me saying they need a picture of my credit card within 7 days or my order is cancelled Now my order is sitting in a nearby city but UPS doesnt deliver sat sun or holidays
Dior reviewed my order and decided it was fraudand it was not I contacted their customer service and they pretty much said sorry Surely there must be a better way to confirm a goodfaith transaction or at least to contact me or my bank before simply canceling the order
Helpbecome more user friendly
The way they treat loyal hard working employees is disgusting He checks the schedule every Monday been doing it for 10 years new manager and all of a sudden he is terminated because he missed 2 shifts So we go in the find out what happened and she refuses to let me in the room with them tells him we post the schedule Friday sorry too bad He literally got an award for perfect attendance last year and if a 70 something year old man doesnt show up for a shift a humman would call to see if he was ok What is wrong with this worldThey didnt have him on for almost a month after the holidays and then they put him on the schedule for 2 days in a row with 2 days notice and dont even call when he doesnt show and dont bother tell him that he was terminated until he calls to see when they were going to have him back on the schedule Absolutely NOT ok Unacceptable 10 years of loyal service without even a courtesy call
No answer to telephone Had to make reservation on line For me not good
I loved paying less than other websites for my contacts but I had to wait 12 days before receiving them Next time Ill go where the shipping is guaranteed within a few days
Ordered in Oct received in Jan excuse after excuse
I purchased several Hardy Boys books The dates of publication on the Biblio website were misleading Two of the booksellers acknowledged the confusion and asked that I be reimbursed for the books I received one reimbursement but not the second I have emailed Biblio numerous times regarding the issue but have received no reply
Jack S is dishonest dont deal with him
Partially completes tasks then demands more money to come and complete his work
Disgusted and probably wont use Airtasker again
Terrible customer service
I had a question I felt was important regarding a product I was buying I wanted over half an hour for a representative to come on the line Finally I chose their option to have someone call me back That was well over a week ago I emailed that I couldnt get anyone to answer my question I got a thank you for choosing us response Needless to say I will never use this company again One star is too much for 0 satisfaction

Schlechter Service
The design and build quality of the goggles was excellent but I couldnt stop them from fogging consistently over the course of half a day even with antifog Removed them from my Smith goggles and decided blurry skiing was safer than fogged skiing

I ordered an item with them a few weeks ago and was given a delivery date a few days later in the week as I paid for expedited delivery So on the window of delivery I get an email saying they still had not received the item from the warehouse so it hadnt bee dispatched yet That I would get it the next week I was then given a new window to expect delivery Again on the date I was supposed to receive the item I get an email saying they still had not receive the item yet What had I paid 30 USD in delivery for
They gave me an option to continue waiting with no real idea of when delivery would be made or a refund I took the refund after waiting for two weeks for an item they clearly never had in the first place I lost out on the exchange rate too when they refunded me as well
In addition to getting these emails about the delay I did email them up to five times to ask about the product specification a simple question yet each them they would just answer something about delivery and not the product question then on the last email reply when I had asked them the 4th time to answer the question about my product they got rather rude didnt answer the question and just asked if I wanted the item delivered or not when it became available
They delivered on time  but it looked nothing like what I saw on the website For the money I paid I would have wanted to see the same flowers not just some random bouquet This was a very disappointing experience as I picked the flowers my wife likes and they didnt honor my choice

YOU PEOPLE JUST SUCK
I bought the tickets from Vienna to Addis Abeba via Istanbul going and coming back Ive planned my journey to start at 13 of February
The flight from Instanbul to Addis was cancelled I believe that flugladende has absolutely nothing to do with that and its not their fault But there are few other things
The solution they proposed didnt satisfy me Waiting 24 hours for the flight cannot be an option Unfortunately I could only change the day of the flight to Addis but not the flight back That means I would have to stay shorter than I wanted
When I ordered the tickets and got the confirmation the time of the journey included the waiting time for the other flight When I got the information about reschudeling the flight then suddenly the time of the journey didnt include the waiting time which was actually around 24 hours Ive almost missed that information and Im sure a lot of people would simple not notice that the date of the flight is different That is not how you do things
Wanted to cancel the flight by phone and get the written confirmation that it had been cancelled by email You know just for my own safety to make sure that I will really get the money back and nobody will tell me after all but you didnt cancel anything Not possible for flugladende Instead of that I need to write an email that I want to cancel then wait for their answer So i did and Im still waiting for their answer
What is the waiting time to get the money back 8 weeks  To take it from my credit card they only needed a second
EDIT
I would love to contact with you but unfortunately since Wednesday I cant even reach you You didnt answer my email which Ive sent you 2 days ago I tried to cancel the flight through your homepage  still no answer Instead of answering that comment to show how much you care it would make me really happy to get a reply on my email In addition I have to say that your hotline is some kind of a joke I had an honor to talk with you once  then Ive tried at least 15 times to talk with somebody called from 3 different numbers at different times from Wednesday up to Friday After listening to your beautiful song for about 1 minute I always got disconnected
Oh and about the booking number which you are asking Dont you have it already I could not post that review without including the booking number so please lets be serious
I recently purchased tickets to watch Liverpool v Chelsea 31st Jan 2017 I purchased 4 VIP  Executive Box tickets for Client entertainment and my first experience at the club
When we arrived at the grounds we were sent to the Paisley Lounge okay thought nothing of it However when going to find our seat at the Executive Box level we were told our tickets were mainstand I explained this was not what I purchased but the man said thats what you got
I have emailed the company TicketBis and had no response to date These tickets cost 190000 for something which should have cost around 700
Disgraceful company and customer service
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY
Reservations canceled without consulting me
went well and I got accommodation from another provider
Poor communication between Redspot and the carhirecomau We were given the wrong size car that we ordered Redspot were unable to rectify the error and could only offer a small discount on our next booking
Please avoid this site at all costs you dont need the headache I thought I had a reservation called th day before to confirm and order a crib no reservation couldnt get a hold of anyone who could help me so just made a second reservation right through the hotel Then the company told me there was no issue with their service that I gave my name wrong and they were still charging me I know my name and didnt give it incorrectly JUST STAY AWAY
Whilst it was all good in the end not an experience I would want to repeat I purchased 2 tickets to Panic In The Disco as a gift for my daughter A sold out concert I bought these weeks before the event I then waited for them to arrive And waited waited TR will not review the situation until 48 hours before the event Sent an email enquiry no tickets and nothing will be done until 24 hours before the event Another email still no tickets The morning of the concert I phone Yes they had tried to contact the seller Still no tickets By this stage we assume the seller has a better offer and has reneged on the sale They finally arrived just a few hours before the concert much to everyones relief So narrowly avoided teenage heartbreak but an emotional rollercoaster Too much hassle to be chasing tickets and be left in limbo having committed and paid for them but not received them You have lost the opportunity to purchase elsewhere Try explaining to a teenager that the guarantee does not mean you will get the tickets but that you will be refunded if they do not arrive
I bought a smartband from them and i have never tried anything so incorrect the sleep time the footsteps its so incorrect it even says i sleep when i am full awake so trust me dont buy it even its cheap you can use it for anything go buy something little more expensive and get something you actually can use
Hotel had absolutely no record of our booking despite Amoma debiting our account for the full amount We were given a room but hotel said that theyd need our card details in case Amoma didnt pay them at all Has been a battle to get any info from Amoma or any explanation Id avoid this company at all costs Additionally I booked through Topcashback  theyve declined my cashback despite it being a bona fide booking Use the other hotel sites you know the ones tried and tested but avoid this one
I wasnt told that 1 of the item I ordered was out of stock and didnt even tell me on email that the item wasnt shipped another item pen light wasnt in the package when I called they insist it is in thew same box as the stetoscope but I still coulnt find it 
I booked my flight over 2 months in advance Few days before flight I got an info that it has been cancelledThey offered unacceptable other flight with different airport  with an overnight stop I didnt get my money back over 500 they say the airline doesnt want to give me a refund  Virgin Atlantic but I do not believe them If you do not want to lose your money stay awayTerrible experience Never again
I usually buy superior hair extensions They are a lot more expensive but worth it because you can use the tape in extensions more than once Airy hair extensions are extremely thick and I couldnt reuse them because they got so knotty and looked almost like dreads In my opinion it is worth spending a bit more
Have to admit the entire experience has really given me a negative view of online learning After reading through a number of reviews I was quite keen to get to grips with the Green Belt Six Sigma Course offered by E Careers Unfortunately the method of delivery is so poor that it made learning very difficult
Initially I perservered thinking that maybe the problem lay with my expectation however after 6 weeks of heavy readingI am at the point of giving up and chalking the cost up to experience I have been a military instructor  as well as being heavily involved in training air traffic controllers and drone pilots I think I do have a reasonable idea of what constitutes effective training and this is not it
My issues are threefold
1 for nearly 200 I get a pdf of a book and power point slides which essentially is the exact wording in the book simply converted to powerpoint This is not training  there is no opportunity to talk to someone if you get stuck and initially I had to go online to find other means of explaining concepts in the book Finally there is only a loose sense of order to the instruction eg COPQ is mentioned within the first few lessons but you do not get to understand what COPQ is until later
2 The course involves the use of a program called Sigma XL which has a significant cost  this is not mentioned at any point during the signup process
3There is no means to question a qualified person to explain concepts that require clarification The book refers to your mentor several times but no mentor has been assigned  Likewise noone has contacted me to see how I was progressing
In my eyes 200 for a book is extremely expensive and I am so glad I did not sign up for the exam at the end of it which would have cost a further 3400 pounds The other training courses E Careers provide may be better but I cannot in good conscience recommend them as a training provider based on my experience
At first the experience with Namecheap was good However when I signed up for my 079 domain it implied that it would be 079 the year after too No They now want 14 from me all of a sudden in a different currency too Theyve now lost a loyal customer and I now have to search for a new host Not impressed
The worst operation on the internet I have come across The 20 first time customer didnt work so I did a live chat to their customer representative He said he would apply it when the order went therough so I placed the order No discount was ever replied The goods were received a month later They were shoddy and a ridiculously small size for a large  nothing like the sizing guide they promote on their website When I told them I anted to return it They said it would be at my cost to China which made it not worthwhile DONT BUY FROM THEM
I like the clothes but as a VIP member if you have credit on your account you cannot take advantage on sales If you plug in the coupon code you cannot use your money that is on your account  you must use with new money If its my money I am putting in each month then why not I love feeling like I am getting a good deal  I just dont

In december 2016 I have bought the Oukitel U15pro from the warehouse i9n Spain After two weeks the phone has several serious technical problems actually it is broken and I request for a new telephone Tiny deal asks me to send the phone back to China for checking and repairing but I can not be without my phone for such a long time and also I have to pay the costs for shipping They say that they do not have a back office in Germany I tried everything to get new replacement for my broken phone but they keep on telling me to send it back to China I am very dissapointed in the service of Tiny deal I advise everybody to watch out with the garanty you have at Tiny Deals they do not replace the broken product very bad service and I will never do bussiness with this company again

Sorry guys not great Im afraid
Small bouquet and the flowers were slightly shrivelled
I guess with most people sending flowers its a pretty important event so you want to have faith
This was well under expectation which I was able to see for myself as I had the pleasure of coming face to face with the bouquet the day after delivery
Will not do this again
When looking for a sale they ask for the age of the driver and show you the corresponding price But when checking out the real price is twice the one they showed because they didnt want to include the under 25 fee If you are not going to make use of that info do not ask for it
I was so looking to install this product What a wonderful concept and easy to install I ordered two samples but they looks so fake that I decided not to purchase the product

I placed an order with them at the end November last year and when it didnt arrive by January this year I decided to contact them to find out what was happening with my purchase I got a reply back a couple of days later asking me to confirm several details about my order and once I did I asked to then wait another month and contact them again if the item hadnt arrived by end of January I then contacted them again at the end of January which was over 2 months after I ordered from them and I was once again to confirm several details After I sent them details for the second time I was told that because I didnt purchase insurance with my postage I am not entitled to a replacement or a full refund I was offered a mare 125 on a 8 item because I had used a voucher as part of my payment I decided not to bother with that 125 and never to use this company again for anything
Terrible experience Was using their online platform for about a year All of a sudden my account was closed I wrote to the customer support team and was told that it was closed for business reasons No refund for open bets and the balance in the account was not repaid No further explanation was given as to why the account was deleted
VIP Membership is stupid due to the charges if you dont skip the month The customer service is terrible Their inventory is low and changes frequently The quality of the products are not the best
Frame is fine But im not quite satisfied with lenses I ordered for their super thin lenses But when I compared their glasses with mine  normal one  not a high index lense both have the same thickness I dont know what you guys meant by SUPER THIN lenses
Echoing most of my fellow reviewers here on Trust Pilot and boy do I wish I came here earlier my company currently holds an extremely negative review of Monstercom based on the sheer poor quality of candidates that they sent over Whats worse is that I have politely written to ask for a refund to no avail how can you not afford to pay back unhappy customers Instead I am given a complimentary refresh to give my posting better traffic at a higher position No This is not what I want at all I am sick of wasting my time on unqualified candidates
To all employers looking to hire we posted the exact same listing on Indeedcom and received not only 3 times as many candidates as we did on Monster but more than 50 of them were qualified compared to the 0 hit rate we had at Monster
Form 2 was meant to be a luxury gift for myself at Christmas I have never spent this kind of money on a toy like this before I figured with all the glowing reviews it must be worth the extra money Well I am still yet to receive a product that works The Form 2 I received in December would not turn on properly It would only make loud shrill noises on the charging base I followed all the troubleshooting suggestions and still nothing I debated just demanding to get my money back but decided I would give JImmyjane a second try I went through the lengthy return process and followed their requests exactly Returned the Form 2 along with cordcharging base 2 months laterI received a little box in the mail that only has a Form 2 replacement in it What am I supposed to do with that They arent going to return the charging base to me Guess I will need to wait another 2 months to receive that What a joke Should have asked for a refund from the beginning
Was so very excited to purchase these tickets to a sold out event only to discover they were for an 18 and over only section did not even know there was such a thing when buying tickets for a concert in an arena type situation goodby 200 and two very disappointed fans I know now to read Every little scrap of text
I used Flight Hub to book a flight from Wpg to Calgary When I received my email confirmation I noticed an extra 140 charge for Manulife insurance My husband said he noticed the same thing happened to him when he booked an earlier flight I called and the lady was super polite and helpful She said the charge can be reversed within 48 hours but would take 10 days to be refunded They told my husband they would do it for him as a one time courtesy what I checked online with WestJet and their prices are the same I have to ask myself why would I go through the trouble of using Flight Hub Shrug
the dress i got ended up being horrible it stained my legs black and the fabric felt incredibly cheap there were also sparkles left EVERYWHERE but to be fair there was a sparkle warning in the description

Placed an order several days in advance to be delivered the Saturday BEFORE Valentines Day to make it easier for my girlfriend to receive the flowers as she often works late during the week Saturday came and went without any delivery I followed up with an email Saturday to Euroflorist and spoke with them on Monday and Tuesday Valentines Day Still no delivery still no explanation or reply from them on what happened still no word on when I can expect resolution
On every single product I went to buy there was large red print that noted I would be getting an introductory rate on these items This turned out not to be true I had to go back and forth several times to see what I missed The discount on leggings was appreciated but I expected my total to be much lower Im very disappointed
problem with local distribution
I booked a hotel room London with lastminutecom in early Nov 2016 The booking engine accepted my request and I paid by credit card Shortly after that I got an email from them saying that the room I booked was not available I was also assured that no charge has been made on my credit card The amount has only been frozen The amount paid was in pounds converted into euros and my card was actually charged and the amount returned the following day Due to the change in the currency rates I got back less than what was charged on my card I am still waiting to hear what their investigation resolves There have been no response to my emails I am puzzled as to why the booking system lets you to choose and pay for a room that is not available why they assured me that no charge has been made on my card when a charge was made and why they are acting so poorly by not responding to my email enquiries which have been quite civilized My bank tells me it is not their issue but rather lastminutes Needless to say I am never going to use lastminute again Luckily I did not lose much but this is a matter of principle
I bought the washable labels and they do not work at all Forget it look somewhere else for labels
I ordered a light at the beginning of December when it arrived it had a fault and was very poor quality I was told to send back to their service centre in Poland  which I did at a cost of 49 the cost and postage of the lights originally was approx 250 so far I have received only 190 back  for some reason and a very strange excuse they say they cannot refund the full amount to the original card they then suggest the rest is refunded by paypal I try three times on paypal and every time someone their end canx the paypal request without paying the money I was then told they could credit my account but I could draw that down onto my credit card  shock horror today I get a message say no it can only be spent as a credit on the site cant be drawn down to the credit card this truly is a jokethis has been going on three months and Im over 60 out of pocket  110 pound if you include the original postage to receive their poor product in the first place very frustratingly  it seem to be someone different who replies to every email you send so they have no idea of the history and dont read the notes  I would highly recommend you do not buy from this company  its verging on fraudulent and trying to get your money back from china or wherever they are seems impossible in my one and only experience the product was also of very poor quality if anyone is reading from lightinthebox and feels the urge to end this sorry story my ticket number is  14596187 and my order number is 1611290720435603 in the meantime if you think Im just going to give up and go away think on
received a 4 spread basin instead of the 8 that I ordered
We purchased a 5 x 10 Heavy Duty PVC marquee in November 2016
Our experience with this marquee is as follows
1 the instructions inside presumably from China were for the wrong size
marquee
2 the side sections have joiner flaps we couldnt make work raising water
tightness and privacy issues
3 the tent pegs and stays which connect to the pegs were not suitable for a marquee of this size
We had the marquee up for a couple of weeks before a gust of wind picked it up and turned it over causing damage to the PVC particularly the roof
Took 4 men to righten it we used wooden stakes on the inside to strengthen it plus put 3 ropes over the roof also connected to wooden stakes
The light steel framing crushed and snapped we found a local welder to repair
The eyelets in the PVC are opening up and will tear open in time
I contacted Trade Tested sending them images of the damage
Their response was that they are not responsible for wind damage
My comment was that there wouldnt have been any wind damage if the the issues with the marquee didnt exist
I contacted them again was told that the matter was under review but didnt receive any further correspondence
These might be ok for a day in perfect conditions but you wouldnt want
to put one up then take it down again the next day
It took 2 of us a good part of a day to put up
Better to hire and let someone else have the problems

The reciever was not at home The delivery guy left the package in front of the door in a crowded street and of course it was stollen I have sent an email to Euroflorist but never got an answer or refund
I got my txt to submit reading I went to submit 2 days later and it told me I couldnt submit 
Once you sign up and they have you committed there is very little communication 
I also want notification from you when and if you increase your rates
It took several attempts and was not easy to see what areas I needed to correct to move forward in the payment process
i am purchasing a wedding gift from registry  do not like that I cant gift wrap and send card with delivery
Ive been trying to return a GPS I purchased because the quality of the unit is substandard and I have been getting the runaround form their customer service department Lisa asks me why I want to return it after explaining to her its a quality and functionality issue I get an email from Taylor who tells me and I Quote For this economical item and we advise to test other functions What does that mean Steer clear of this company HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SHODDY MERCHANDISE
Recently purchased this car and on test drive felt vibration a manager who had been using it denied feeling it A week later I had it in tyre shop they found left rear had delaminated  about to come apart they had tried to keep vibration down by adding a lot of weights to inside of wheel No consideration for my safety or that of others  whoever did roadworthy should have their licence taken off them 
Im reviewing from a recipients standpoint The package was sent from the US and it was a small package consisting of written letters The parcel was held up at the Chinese customs I had to apply for clearance and pay additional fees for tax and handling in order to get my package On top of the extra fees the package arrived three weeks late Without doubt one of the worst courier services Ive encountered Strongly suggest AGAINST using Parcel Monkey
Slechte services
Happy initially but after the sitter had my puppy and she barked the sitter said she was worried she would set off all the other dogs she was taking care of and the neighbors would call the cops Highly unprofessional
Until now I was always satisfied with this company In my last order while I was checking up and selecting in which service point I want my package delivered I realised that my usual post office ICA Nra Lappkrsberget was not in the list so I chose the one that was first in that list ICA Nra Bergshamra The problem was that instead of getting my package delivered to StockholmBergshamra I got it delivered to Bergshamra in Norrtlje which is one hour driving distance from where I live
I called the customer service and they told me that there is nothing they can do but to wait until the package is returned
My feeling is that your response was not acceptable since there are some obvious problems with the way you display the neares service point I have many post service points around my place I dont think a service point that is 1h by car from my address should appear on the first position of the list
I ordered an expensive orchid arrangement The arrangement that I ordered was a cheaper version that didnt look like the photo although I paid the top versions price

This site is a pure scam as i ordered and ive paid for something that after some time arrived from China with a 65 surplus in taxes You imagine Suppose you pay 10 when the postman comes you have to pay other 65 of what youve already paid so you have to pay the postman other 65 The reason why this site is a total scum it is given by the fact that theres no mention of this risk at all Only the possibility of making a generic insurance If i was adviced by them before ive placed the payment i shouldnt have placed the order Simple as that The only possibility of having my money back now is on paypals hands as i opened a treat with them lucky me that i have paid wt paypal Absolutely NOT They propose a PARTIAL REFOUND by sending back the items SO I WAS RIPPED OFF BY THEM INDEED as even in case of the refound i have to pay for shipping expences to give them the items and I WONT BE REFOUNDED FOR THE TAXES Sorry miinthebox or lightinthebox in your box theres no light except a total scum
So frustrated with Purolator I always get delivery attempted when I track the package and it says delivery notice attached on door I never found any notice This happened to me 67 times Driver dont know how to use buzzer at all Customer service just cut the phone when I was describing my problem with Purolator Just never buy anything from the vendor that ships using Purolator Even though I have forwarded my calls to another number when my primary phone is unreachable I simple never received any call and when contacting customer care they say driver called you but no response Hell with Purolato so annoyed
Booking this online itself was very simple and straight forward However I had many issues
Checking in to my hotel once I arrived I was kept for over half an hour There apparently was an issue with my booking not being on the system even when I Quote d my reference I ever provided email confirmation but that wasnt enough I then had to contact this company to get futher proof it was such an inconvenience I also had problems checking out the following day Im not sure whos error this was but the service at my hotel was appalling
Although my first two orders were fine I am very disappointed this time terrible communication and nonexistent Customer Service Received an email saying that there was a problem with my order but not what the problem was Tried to contact them various times through their site and by email No response received whatsoever My order still hasnt arrived nearly two weeks later I am going to try and claim the money back via paypal since I cannot get a response from Healthier Choice
The worst delivery service Ive ever faced They left my package twice in different place instead of deliverying it to my apartment I think couriers have no idea what does it mean door to door delivery Leaving package in working place without letting me know just because there was the same name on the package with working stuff  that suprised me Thank God my boss was nice and informed me that one of the packages seems not to be related to work stuff and that probably was my privat order because he can see my apartments address on it And today  I got sms with information that I should pick up my package in portkiosken I checked in system  courier wrote that I was not available Interesting because I was in flat for the whole day waiting for package I cancelled some meetings and changed my schedule to be able to pick up this package as I need it urgently But wellall what the company can do now is rescheduling my delivery for wednesday but I am pretty sure that my package will be again in some other place than my flat so  no thank you for such service and I will report the issue to the company which sent the package to me and I hope that maybe they will do something about it
In the terms is writte down that Please note that YoungSenior Driver fees will only be displayed correctly if you entered your age correctly in the search criteria so Ive entered my age 23 and it displayed the price I tought that this is the endprice After comming in the USA they also wanted from me 25 Dollar a day Young driver fee and there was no change to get the car without paying Also my prepaid amount was not prepaid in the car rental they said nothing was prepaid and Ive to pay the full amount Really discusting after a 12 Hours flight
I ordered 450 USD worth of items and it was posted by ordinary mail with no insurance and no tracking The package is lost and they dont even reply emails Bunch of thieves
It was honestly not too clear how and when the funds would have been debited or reserved on our credit card We booked in January for August of the same yearif they want to reserve the amount on the credit card are they planning of keeping it reserved for 7 months
I would honestly prefer to have the full amount debited on booking and eventually refunded in case of a cancellation
Insurance coverage is also not clear I found just after being contacted from a rental cars sales representative that the full coverage I had bought at the time of the reservation was offered from rental cars and not from the renting company Even if the price offered was very convenient the claim process in the event of an accident was nowhere specified at the time of reservation
These two web sites have the exact same shoes clothes and purses I joined shoe dazzle to see if they offered better stuff To my surprise they were the same I will be canceling my subscription
Many times I try to contact them regarding quality I havent received any revert Long lasting wait for calling
Voice distraction

They charge double for their products I was on Walmartcom last night trying to order John Frieda Frizz Ease Hair Serum Extra Strength and Pharmapacks is a 3rd party seller on there They were charging 1645 for it while Walmart has it for 797 This company is price gouging and should be shut down
SPEDIZIONE E RESI PIU VELOCI E DESCRIZIONE PIU PRECISA E DETTAGLIATA IN PARTICOLARE PER LE TAGLIE
I had a poor experience of this company before but stupidly tried again My plane was diverted and was late to pick up car In spite of me phoning through they said we we no show and cancelled booking without refund suggesting to get payment back from insurance Difficult to contact and inflexible my advice is do no use this company
I placed my order but I must have copied an old order to my basket so once it arrived it was incorrect I emailed to advise the issue and within 5 mins someone had answered the query and told me how to fix and then to top it off they would replace free of charge I would absolutely recommend and use OptimalPrint again
Should be on same page
Not for the first time that I have been seriously disappointed with DPD Belgium They claimed to have attempted delivery twice but only left proof of one attempt We arranged with their call centre for delivery and waited at home all day  no delivery Then we arranged with the call centre to collect the package from a local pickup point But for some reason DPD then decided to return the package to sender There are serious issues with the socalled service and complete disconnects between the delivery department and the call centre Has anyone ever had a good experience with this company I havent
EN  The item was not the same as said in the description and they didnt paid the return costs after they have said that they would pay
SP  El producto no era el que se indicaba en la descripcin y no quisieron pagar los costes de devolucin a pesar de habernos dicho que lo haran
I was notified that part of my order was on backorder I had received an email from the VP of sales welcoming me as a customer I sent her an email for more info about my order  never heard from her Very poor customer service
My family and I are going to Rome from the 8th of april to the 13th of april to celebrate my parents silver wedding anniversary On the 23th of january our flight from Copenhagen to Rome was canceled and we got offered an alternative flight to GO to Rome on the 13th so that we would ARRIVE in Rome AFTER our flight back home had left Immediately I contacted Bravofly through telephone and was promised a quick solution to this problem  now one whole month after there is still no solution This is not okay at all I have contacted you every week since the 23th and I keep being told that you treat my case as an emergency but still I never get a solution I just want to go to Rome on the 8th as planned or I want all of my money back so we can find another company to plan our vacation through I am writing here as it seems the only way to actually get your attention  and to warn everyone who expect some form of decent costumer service to book through your company
Was scheduled to arrive on 29 Has not shown up yet
I ordered some plants as a gift They didnt ship for over a month even though they charged me when I placed the order They also didnt send me a notice when the items did ship so I had to keep going back to the website to try to track down the status of my order You cant link from the order email directly to the tracking page you have to reenter everything It was just a big pain to manage this gift A few automated emails from them with an estimated and actual shipping date would have made my experience much easier Also dont charge my credit card until you ship the product
The Oakley sunglasses I chose I picked to be the lenses like in the picture purple mirror and they came brown Need better clarification on what your getting

Ordered for 2 car seats for my children over a month ago it says delivery is 5 working days at the time of placing the order Each time I called and get through to someone after holding for like an hour they promised the order would be delivered on that day and I have been waiting since I cannot take my children anywhere as there is no car seat for them and these people promised 34 days to process my refund which I dont believe as I just checked their page and it says 30 days refund policy Please go to a reputable company these are thieves and people should be aware
I was excited to get a 10x15 indoor unit for my business and so I reserved that unit I received a call from StorageExpress and they told me that unit wasnt available Has happened several times before they told me
I used cellunlocker for my HTC phone about a month and a half ago and paid 41 after conversion from USD to Canadian dollars My code did not work and after a MONTH AND A HALF of trying to get a refund I am left without a refund and now without any money to buy a new SIM card for my new phone that was given to me out of pity due to being an extremely broke student who relied on this company to work
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY they will not reply to your emails once they have your money and they will not issue a refund unless you continually hassle them over a ridiculous time span To get a refund you need to take a video of the IMEI and unlock code not working which is extremely hard when you dont have a phone due to this situation Still waiting for my money back
Horrible service absolutely a money grab and nothing more
OFRECEN NEUMATICOS X UN PRECIO DE OFERTA SE HACEN PEDIDOS Y OHHHHSORPRESA SE HAN EQUIVOCADO EN EL PRECIO Y ANULAN EL PEDIDO LAS ALTERNATIVAS TAMBIEN ESTAN AGOTADAS  ESTA EMPRESA EN MI EXPERIENCIA DECEPCIONANTE
Here is the response I received regarding a 42 difference
We are not responsible if the airlines decide to offer a flight at a lower cost or if they release other lower fares It is you as a customer to shop and make sure that you have the price you want As per our cancellation policy we do have a charge to cancel of 75 when you book on Flighthubcom as you know I understand that it is not convenient for you but at the mean time you booked without knowing our policy It is your responsability as a consumer to get the information about our rules and policies to cancel and change flights to make sure you are aware about the conditions of your purchase
The agent said she could cancel my reservation and book the one at the lower cost but it would cost be 75 How can you even offer that to a client knowing that it will cost you more by following her suggestion
I have researched this company after this experience they have been rated F by the BBB and their accreditation has been revoked Speaks volumes doesnt it
Great service but the cartridge i got was a dud Spent 30min trying to fix it Will see if they supply a free replacement
Reading good thing about TomTop made me come to a conclusion to go ahead and order the TomTop touchscreennavigation system for my Mustang to replace the base model radio with the touchscreen system When I got the shipement and installed it I realized a few things wrong with the touchscreen The colors were weird and purple along with the screen cracked a little on the bottom This happens and I am not disappointed there my disappointed comes when I send multiple emails asking for some customer support I written those emails and describing my problem with no reply which by far is very disrespectful being that I spend over 300 dollars with TomTop I am still patiently waiting for a reply that will probably never come VERY DISAPPOINTED

I made a prepaid reservation to rent a car from Sixt at Piarco International Airport from Jan 25 to February 1st 2017
Before conscenting to rent the car Sixt demanded an additional deposit of 50000 US I found this additional demand irrational because I was not forewarned about this development Since I could not assure Sixt about this additional requirement I could not get the rental car This left me unable to fulfill what I thought was a done deal
Since I did not get the rental car as promised I hereby ask that my deposit be refunded to me immediately
Thanks
I ordered a pair of shoes from Norway and they were not as expected and I chose to return them
I only got partial refund which I am not used to In Norway most serious companies have free return and full refund
I would not shop here again unless I tried the product physically at a regular store and were 100 sure that they fit perfectly
I am very disappointed
I ordered 3 products for 24 shopno i paid the price and also the postal cost I get the information that the product will be shipped from Sweden while the webpage is shows that it is the norwegian portal Well It did not bother me then I paid the price of product and post 387NOK But I ended up paying 260 NOK extra to recieve the delivery this was not mentioned in the order nor on webpage and I can not even guess since I ordered from norwgian portal and have no clue where they are going to deliver product from If this continue buyer must be aware of this trickness that when you are shopping form 24 hours you are not shopping cheap
Your site said 25 days for delivery It took 11 days too long I wont order from you again
Check needs to be improved
I was told by staff it takes 24 hours for flight to be processed before I could contact airline to redeem an upgrade This was not true and as a result of this information my upgrade was no longer available when I called
I placed an order for catering from Firehouse subs on Fowler Ave in Tampa at 400 pm on Friday afternoon for a funeral wake Monday morning On Sunday night at 900 pm I get a text message that the order has been cancelled Phone number leads to voice mail Then 10 pm an email that repeated the cancellation and the offer to call voicemail again Before you order catering from ezCater ask yourself what you will do if they cancel the order overnight before your event
Their website states that they conduct a robust assessment of ones financial condition Based on my experience this appears to be incorrect and very misleading
They refused to even accept my application and i wasnt able to upload my bank statements at all We last applied for a loan 10 months ago at that time we were told we could reapply in 6 months Again this statement was on their website and yet again it was misleading and simply wasnt true
In the 10 months since we last applied our business turnover has increased in excess of 120 however they didnt even wanted to know this at all they simply refused to allow me to repay
My advise gained from nearly 30 years in business is to totally avoid this business  there are far better options out there for small business funding
Antipatica a dir poco
Googling for a product item via the phone and being linked to the product sitefor an easy order So far so good i think Good price on the item The same item name as on the manufacturers site and other sites selling the same jacket Only that on this site BlueTomato this is a womans jacket One of the pictures displays a woman wearing the jacket and this is more visible on the full site but absolutely not using your phone to browse
Customer service has absolutely no interest to meet me half way on this me wanting the correct item
I am so totally disappointed from their lack of interest in me as a customer

Since 311 when I initated the request for 3 Quote  have only received emails from your company but have not been contacted by any retailer even the ONE company you have supposedly found for us
Would not recommend your service and will now look elsewhere
Bad run bring back and pick up the car in the same row to long wait times

From Paris gare de Lyon to Paris Nord is not a walking distance Paris subway is a necessity This is critical Information for every traveler and missing in overview Very disappointing
We booked a room and paid via credit card then were told that there were no rooms available then offered an alternative hotel tried to contact Easy to book were put on hold then disconnected sent an email still no reply and still no refund or cancelled transaction on the credit card Still pending Ill use Trivago next time
Changing owners No one knew where office was Called corporate office walked all over Finally a lady told me When I got there some guy painting office told me he didt speak English then another guy told me the same Couldnd get discount on first month Finally got the 1st unit that I reserved on line Lots of problems
My 61916 order took 3 weeks to process and deliver I wore them 34 times over the next 6 months as I rarely need them A nose piece arm fell off although they were never damaged mishandled or put under any pressure I returned them 12616 for warranty repair warranty I received a call 129 saying the frame is no longer available in brown so they were replacing with gray and they would no longer be covered under warranty I found this odd and rude as there was 6 months remaining on the warranty They were received in poor condition on 1917 earpieces wider at tip than hinge one earpiece 316 lower than the other and the case was broken They had been well packed for return I sent them back again that same day for repair They were received 120 adjusted but with a case that was not same as original and too large for the glasses
This was a poor experience from the start Times for processing and the first repair were too long and the second return should not have been necessary The call to say the remaining warranty would not be honored was absurd as the glasses were not damaged but failed and they did not allege otherwise I do not recommend Frames Direct for their poor customer service and will not buy again
I signed up and ordered two expensive items on Dec 8th My account was billed December 9th the same day this company closed for business I dont know why they would have collected my money on the same day they were going out of business I didnt notice the announcement for many days after the order assuming it would eventually arrive I went to great lengths to verify the trust of this business and even called to talk to a nice woman before placing my order I now have trouble trusting Internet Businesses I am willing to take part in criminal prosecution Any ideas
Trustpilot routinely deletes bad reviews for money at the companies request For that reason this site absolutely cannot be trusted
THEY SEND THE DRESS VERY QUICK
BUT ANYWAY GET LOST
IM WAITING FOR THE INVESTIGATION TO END
I DONT HAVE THE DRESS AND I DONT HAVE MY MONEY
THAY SHOULD HAVE A BETTER SHIPPING COMPANY FOR AN EXPENSIVES DRESES
Prices are going up each year since I started using this
Purchased 1 item Since then I can not access the website on any device
It was a waste of money the connection did not fit my phone at all The micro connection was too big
I HAVE PLACED A ORDER AND STILL NOT GOT IT I ORDER IT FOR A BIRTHDAY AND THE BIRTHDAY WAS ONE MONTH AGO
STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY PACKAGE
Levering sneller
This company is awful to deal with Customer service is shocking no telephone number no email address just a useless ticket system which they ignore
I was told Id receive a refund for an order I cancelled of some dental products
A month later I still dont have a refund theyre ignoring my tickets
Now going through process of citizens advice bureau which will undoubtedly end up with going to small claims court
Definitely avoid this company like the plague
It offers very good rates compared to others nevertheless the quality of the call is not so good WhatsApp offers a free and much better quality of call
We rented a car with Goldcar Barcelona Airport for 3 weeks Returned it in the same condition as we collected it It was signed off as okay by a Goldcar Rep when it was returned Goldcar sent an email 3 days after we returned to the UK informing us that it was taking 450 from our credit card with photos of scratches that we had already marked on the collection document and which had been agreed to the Goldcar dispatcher
When we checked our credit card 2 days later 735 had been withdrawn not 450 as noted with no notification This is theft
M and S Mastercard has put this into dispute with Goldcar but this is a WARNING Giving you credit card details to pay for an additional item at collection means that they can take what they like once you are gone
This had never happened to us in over 10 years of renting cars in Spain and we were shocked at this outright fraud
We have never had a reply from Goldcar
The 250 truck would not work and instead of standing behind your product you sold me you just gave me a number to the manufacturer
My money was wasted
Very English approach to customer service Instead of working to rectify issue  much time spent by your rep explaining why there was little he could do Perhaps your English customer base is accustomed to not having their issues resolved I am not I expected a request to reroute my order to be actioned Instead after several hours of no response during UK business hours I received a long explanation why this was not possible Oddly enough having contacted DPD couriers directly they were happy to oblige Really poor service from your rep Having spent 1000 I do not expect to return
Neiman Marcus prices and Walmart service
there 247 phone support are always down beyond their control if they do answer it a answering that dont know nothing about the service they are selling you AND TO TOP IT ALL THEY CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD WITH NO SERVICE PROVIDE NOT EVEN AN INVOICE stay away from those SCAMMER
I do not like the fact that you do not let the customers use their credit during the sales Its the same as paying for it because you take the money from our accounts Its unfair to the customers because if we use our credit the item goes back to the regular price Its just another way for you to get more money out of us I will be canceling my account
I asked for a product availability and they told me that his supplier have it in stock
After ive done the money transfer they told me that in fact the model i have paid is no longer produced and wanted to sell me another model instead
When I ask for refund they told me that they are very busy so iwill have to wait to get my money back
Buy at your own risk
Took 3 weeks to receive order way to long
I paid full balance for number plate DAR9N I sent all the documents they have quested they keep my money for six weeks then they turned around said they cant get hold on seller then they tried to give me another number plate but I have refuse it then I made more than nine calls to get full refund at the end this is not the way to run the business if youre not sure the seller sell the numberplate you should not advertise on your website
I bought a phone 2 months ago and its still not here I have been contacting tinydeal all they do is ask me to continue waiting
The overall buying experience was horrible but I am satisfied with the product also I will not recommend the store to anyone because of the workers and buying experience
AVOID Rented a car from Gold car for ten days in Gran Canaria When I arrived I was asked if I wanted to take additional car insurance I declined because I had already purchased additional insurance with another online provider
The lady behind the desk handed me a contract in Spanish and I was told I needed to pay a refundable deposit
When I returned home I discovered they hadnt given me all my deposit back I called the Gold Car office and was told I had agreed to take the additional insurance and signed the contract I kicked up a fuss and they gave me an email address
I emailed and got a response to say as I signed the contract nothing I can do I even sent them proof of the other insurance I had taken out I felt my case wasnt dealt with properly and they never answered any of my questions just kept copying and pasting the last email they sent me
Its an absolute scam and I cant believe they get away with it They have taken 150 from my account and its disgraceful You only have to google them and see all the bad things
I dont ever write reviews but I would advise everyone to avoid using Gold Car
Everyone was nice but did not call when they said they would Also facts were confused often and the whole process took at least three times longer than first projected Many facts were not explained to me ahead of time and that made it difficult to understand what was going on from one point to another
I didnt receive my deposit back 200
no invoice received
Impossible bonus scheme where ultimately you will have to win at 20011 to make any money off it sneaky tactics  too many to count really bad odds Cash Out never works once game in play oh and you have to pay to withdraw at 5 a time The only thing they can guarantee is theyll steal your money
Emailed in December enquiring about a sun holiday Got an email back in January with an apology for not answering my email as they had been busyStill waiting for the holiday information and its February now
Just tried to book a flight from Oslo to Aalborg Denmark All went ok however payment credit card details could not be processed Tried twice and then gave up Assuming the booking was therefore not validated went to another Company to make travel plans Some time later I received booking confirmation and flight emails from Travelgenio so contacted Customer Service via their web site email to advise the circumstances and booking cancellation No response to this so phoned to confirm Apparently there is a cancellation fee of EU30 which I objected to in the circumstances All to no avail as the operator advised they could not cancel the booking until I agreed to the fee
I also seem to recall that there was a cool off period for free cancellation of the booking Obviously passing on my credit card details has put me in a no win situation with this Company Refers Booking code 6G911Y
Be very careful
i have ordered softie shoes before the order received before this sent 2 right shoes very dangerous as the velcro strap on the right shoe gets stuck to the left shoe and causes falling i verbally gave my concern by telephone  but was in dire need of the shoes so we fabricated the velcro so it wouldnt stick and then it stopped working all together on this order i emailed Collin support agent i was assured by Collin through email that one shoe would be left and one would be right so i ordered a pair of softie shoes in mens large the same as always when they arrived they were 2 left shoes although i was very disappointed i decided to mix the two pairs so i would have a left and a right in both pairs WELL THE DISAPPOINTMENT DOESNT END THERE the new shoes were 12 inch longer than the other mens large pairs i had ordered in the past being in a wheelchair is difficult enough now i have a shoe in each pair that hangs out over my footstand and is constantly hitting things
i am looking for an alternative lymphedema products and company do not work for the customer they work for their ceomoney it feels
Despite the cheap prices the taste that remains after renting a car from Goldcar is bitter Its the taste of being fooled Charges hidden so effectively that it gets ridiculous
The second star is just for the cheap rates
Stay away if ordering from outside the UK
You will find many cases of items being ordered and either never received or unacceptable long delays The carrier company that they use is incompetent in managing items though local customs and both their and Probikekits follow up is non existent You will be given scripted responses when you inquire they get that many they now exactly what to say and plenty of promises but little action Save yourself the trouble spend the few extra  and go elsewhere as there are more professional and empathetic companies out there
Picked up day late not delivered in timeframe Couldnt track online  link down Was told by online assistant to phone through to track couldnt track over phone  systems down Chased again after nondelivery and was told it was self serve product and she couldnt track for me Eventually found sitting in a depot for over a week
Simply the worst They advertise no hassle returns but dont follow thru I contacted customer service via online chat  was told IN WRITING that I could return an activity tracker that was a gift without a receipt  no problem Wrong The store said that they do things differently online but the stores cannot accept returns of electronics without a receipt I contacted corporate  was told the employee was misinformed  would be counseled and that I was out of luck No more Kohls for me  theres plenty of other businesses out there that will be more than happy to accept my money Their prices are ridiculous anyway unless you have coupons or their silly Kohls Cash
I have been a customer of Paddy Power for 4 or 5 years and to be fair have never had an issue before a few weeks ago I normally play the online slots and was lucky enough to get my winnings up to over 1000 so I withdrew them to my account Now Ive made withdrawals of 500600 before with absolutely no problems so didnt expect any this time either and theyre normally pretty quick sort of 23 days So I checked my account and there was no money deposited no need to panic so I waited the maximum time stated on their website 5 working days still no money So I contacted them by email to ask if there was any issue I should be aware of 12 hours later no reply to my email So I decide Ill ring them and find out I am told that there was a problem with withdrawals on the date that I happened to make my withdrawal request So far it has been two full weeks I have spoken to 5 different people by phone and sent Ive lost count so this is an estimate 40 or so emails about it Keep being told they are working to resolve the issue but basically it comes down to they couldnt possibly care less You know youre in trouble when the customer service people start quoting their terms and conditions at you I was not aware that they had such a bad rating on Trustpilot but I would urge anyone thinking of using an online gambling site to look elsewhere
I never received a product ordered online I have been trying to reach Dior all day 11117 and cannot seem to get through by telephone or email
Amigosautos does not give the opportunity to return the car one day before and get the money back
I called Amigosautos to ask and all I got was we do not usually give the money back without proposing any way to do it
With other companies this is possible
The website has a large selection of glasses which is what the company gets one point for The entire handling proces is a disaster which I can only summarise as the worst shopping experience ever I will not go back I will inform my friends and familiy not to order with this company
My experience was less than desirable There was a week delay in delivering the the watch I ordered Also we were charged extra for custom We werent informed about this charge when we were purchasing the watch
It took too long from the order time to the delivery Plus the tracking code provided was not recognized by the postal service
Completely different flowers than I ordered and paid for
It was very frustrating on the financing terms not being clear until the end and had to redo the purchase 5x
I would like to see more variety in the body types of your models to see what an item might look like on me
The questionaiire was lengthy and despite there was several clarificaions needed and the time spent was much more than anticipated The payment was not received till nuch later and when it didnt go through the bank account no attempt was made to contact me to confirm the account information
The first order had a defect in it I bought a headlight for a bicycle and the wire is exposed because the screw was lose I contacted Tomtop via email and sent a picture of the unit They would not do anything So Im stuck with something that works but has an expose wire installed in a bicycle that is exposed to the elements Not really safe to use
This company is a joke cannot purchase item on the website will not let me pay I have emailed the company about this but no response also I have tried to phone them and is constantly engaged I have tried for over a week  disgusting customer service
I was excited to get resale tickets over Jan long weekend for Mormons for my husband and mother in law for Xmas However on ordering it said restricted which I presumed meant restricted due to not able to resale tickets again On receiving tickets and printing out they said restricted viewingI was then very worried that there was a major pole or similar in the view The tickets cost around 220 each but on the ticket it said they were 60 each my Mother in law asked if we got them cheap The restricted tickets turned out to be my husbands seathe couldnt see the last person on the stage at the sidewhich he was not worried aboutmy MIL had a perfect view So it turned out well but when giving for a gift it was a bit stressful Should have better explanation on website with restricted wording
The website stated that I would not have to pay immediately but the card information only required to secure the booking had the full amount of the rental out of my account within 1 day
I received my order almost two weeks ago I sent several emails to the customer service regarding missing items all the 25 units of oneplus case item 1069297 and they never answered When I contacted them on chat they keep telling me wait 48 hours extremely careless customer service I begged them for a solution and they didnt even care Beware this site I clearly do not recommend them they dont care about you and your money
This is for order 23227011
I hate the restrictions I have with this company I was angry that I missed the deadline before they charged me and I tried to call to talk to a rep and it was just an automated message Horrible Absolutely horrible Now i guess I have to order something bc ill never get my money back now

Give Description on how to fix order
Your service centre team a bit rude and not helpful called a couple of stores the nicest one is only Fremantle Store trading hours in google not updated
we have been waiting forever for the rest of our order unacceptable
This purchase was a time sensitive order and we were told it would be shipped the same day Received the product 3 days later and when we went to set it up there was no ink that came with the printer This was not mentioned when placing the order When we called to get the ink we were told it should be a cartridge package for the ink and they shipped it same day which we received the next day It was not the correct ink for the printer however when I called again it was to find out we had been shipped the wrong printer New printer was shipped and received within 1 day Hopefully all problems are at an end
I ordered a laser engraver It arrived very quickly in an undamaged box When I opened the box the object plate the plate that you attach the item to be laser engraved to was afloat in the box and it was clearly visible that the attachment between the plate and the servo was broken I sent 3 separate emails to the TomTop website sales and support emails the only way to contact them and I have not received a response So I have an unusable item and wasted 80
arrived with no retail packaging It may be genuine but i cant be 100 that they are especially when theyre supposed to be coming from Rays direct Wouldnt buy from again because of this
I purchased an Aven 26700302 digital microscope advertised as 9Mp
big heavy stand clumsy at best
poorly built microscope and software that would not discover the microscope on windows
alternative software produced images at 1744 x 1308so the 9Mp was some sort of interpolation
I called test equipment depot the supposedly manager of customer service said she would call me back and never did next I emailed and got the argument that it was a 9Mp camera in the scope
back and forth over several weeks I finally get an RMA no shipping label so I have to pay shipping and they charged me a restocking fee
so this company spends 3 phone calls 6 emails to cheat a customer out of  40 what will they do if you buy some expensive equipment
My initial draft of my wedding invitations RSVPs driving instructions and thank you cards looked great When I received my large number of final prints the quality was TERRIBLE and material of the invitations different though I ordered the same material Now I have to wait for replacements to send them out Horrible
I received the wrong book and in spite of pleasant communications with the seller I still havent received the book I ordered I returned the wrong book Maybe some other customer is looking for it
Be wary of this company ordered a number of blinds measured them perfectly they arrived either too long or too short then they have a get out clause not to fix your problems
Do not buy from this company absolute Cowboys
I used the app and the chat was constantly closed out and had to be restarted several time however even with all of the technical issues they still managed to swear I had used over 20000 in sessions when I never had a session that was working longer then 6 minutes When I reached out to them they only acknowledged the cheapest session in which I still havent gotten a refund from meanwhile they are still trying to charge me an additional 6834 on top of the 200 they already took so after all of the back and forth I am convinced they purposely time the sessions out end the psychics burn out the free 3 minutes on purpose because they are trying to scam poor ppl who are just trying to get help I will write a review on every site and file a claim with bbb
Sorry i ever changed to energia
wedding registry didnt fill in address and the rest
About two month ago I cancelled a flight I should get back money But there is no money refunded until yet Never ever opodo
Had the car less than a year and 6 months its been in the shop 4 times now the engine is shot and they tell me the warranty is out so they have to make a decision if they will fix it or not Long story short I still will owe them 1600000 if they dont fix it or as they tell me i can let them repo and still owe NEVER EVER GO TO THESE PEOPLE  im a vet trying to take care of a family and thought this was a good place to go NEVER EVER GO TO THESE PEOPLE
I ordered the 6 stems Deluxe Chrysanthemums which is a multiheaded flower each stems have about 10flowerhead hence lovely full bouquet for 34 plus vase and delivery total cost of 48
They substituted it with my agreement but they didnt tell me it is going to be 6 stems of Gerbera single headed flower I assumed it will be the same value replacement as their Policy
 substitutions of items of equal or greater value will be necessary 
I received 7 stems of Gerbera for 34 their illustrated Gerbera Premium bouquet contains 16 stems for 33
So in reality I had less then half of the flowers I sent them a photo of the delivered bouquet confirming it ministandard Gerbera was sent
Checked with local Florist 1 a stem  and recipient Country Florist  less than 1 a stem to confirm the price of the Mini and Standard Gerbera is the same price just in case that is their excuse
Their argument is Original order 6 stems replacement 6 stems
I emailed them to ask a question If I ordered 16 stems of Gerbera and they had to substitute it for the Chrysanthemums would it be 16 stems
Of course there is no answer from them
Those people who gave 5 reviews probably dont see a photo of the delivered flowers
Lets face it if someone sends me flowers I will say thank you it was lovely
I wont say by the way It contained 6 stems etc
So think before you order from Floraqueen Learn from other peoples mistake
They deliver so keep them in mind But only order in extreme desperation
The price was misleading and the timer set to make an order was unfair The experience was confusing overall
This is a review for an order not for customer service Consider this an inadequate experience but no friction since no interaction with Dresslilly staff I ordered 2 blouses that were labeled 3XL They were from the Plus Size section of the website They are clearly not the usual 3X that comes from most brick and mortar stores Dresslilly should label them correctly I can wear them but the person they were intended for as a gift will not be able to wear them Wont bother to send back or ask for a replacement Will steer clear of any deals on this website
We engaged Peterborough showroom in Jan 16 to revamp our ensuite
We agreed the design products all supplied by Peterborough Porcelanosa etc and after doing so they sacked the sales girl who we are still in contact with
Our Installation team attempted to install the supplied shower enclosure with no successthe shower door did not close due to faulty hinges The Peterborough showroom version showed the same fault and even they admitted that they couldnt install it either We also had a bespoke sink unit manufactured by them with a Tap that we were assured should work  Yeah  Right
Well it all didnt work
We advised Peterborough that we required products that were fit for purpose under the Consumer law and Trading Standards only to be told to contact their customer services What a laugh
Peterborough were given notice in June 16 that they had 30 days to rectify the faults which they did not emails received from Mr S from Porcelanosa  were outside the timeline under UK Law Our Credit Card were informed and took action
What followed could not be written as a comedy script initially total denial that they were breaching UK law then offering to send their maintenance engineers to fix the shower enclosure and Tap in early sept 16
Given that the Consumer Act only allows 30 days this was a joke
Any way we entertained this idiot from Sani fix subsidiary of Porcelanosa His attendance was unbelievable he had no knowledge of the tap issue even though we had an email from there so called customer services  Mr S saying that this would be fixed at the same time of fixing the shower door which had been unusable since June 16  
We only wanted them onsite to fix the shower door and in doing so he defrauded the company by saying he had supplied and fixed 4 hinges rather than the two he had installed After which he proceeded to trash the whole installation including the shower installation Funny that given that my brotherinlaw had just moved to a new house  and the shower installation was the same as ours  except it worked However he did admit that the shower unit problem was known  2 mths before we accepted purchase
In the meantime having exceeded UK law this company started sending emails which contained increasing misinformation and each one contradicted the previous Mr V It soon transpired that that Porcelanosa customer services were staffed by  deaf dumb and blind individuals Mr S Who is an outright liar  Ms B who can not respond to emails and Mr V  who is so incompetent it is unbelievable
Anyway this company has now been found to have breached UK Law in supplying goods that are not fit for purpose  we now have our money back and are now starting from scratch again with companies who are professional and not cowboys
Use at your at cost
If you de3al with this company  on your own head be it
I had sent them a request a week ago and it took me emailing customer service and resending the request for them to even take a look at it Then I was informed after sending them fourteen images that they couldnt see the costume properly and that it was too complicated to make when within 24 hours of making another request to another site they confirmed they could make it the fabric they would make it with and have it done within my budget Customer service was unhelpful and almost seemed automated in their responses Go elsewhere its not worth the strain
EDIT now they are interested in emailing me because I posted a poor review They claimed they didnt have any materials I liked when they never offered any materials in the first place I do not know anything about making costumes or materials thats why I came to them and I told them that in my first commission email Very disappointed and now very creeped out by the fact they think its okay to email me about this review
I ordered flowers for Valentines day and they did not arrive
Product never arrived didnt get my money back and they never reply to emails
I ordered from this web page on 1 January and still now I did not received my order and I have no answer from the customer service even I texted them on Facebook and on web too The amount is not high what I paid but the ignorance makes me really annoyed You cant handle your clients like that These bad service makes all Chinese business in doubt that Everytime you want to buy something you have this horrible feeling they will lie to you And it is true My first and last try to buy anything from China Shame on you guys You made me really disappointed
It was not clear to me that i was buying the same ticket for more money The same ticket was available for general admission I thought the resale ticket was for a better seat Beware
I was a few weeks late yes it was my fault No money coming into the house very stresful time and right at Christmas too I was told if I didnt pay they were going to install a pay as you go meter without my permission onto my property So I promptly left them and signed up to another company
Hello while I am completely satisfied with the actual product I purchased 1 x eyeliner I was outraged by the size and amount of packaging that was used to ship an item that is merely the size of a pencil The eyeliner was packed in a white Dior Gift box approx 10 x 4 which itself was packed into a large cardboard box This small a makeup product would easily fit in a small padded envelope and should not be the object of such waste of packaging Sorry to say I will never mailorder anything from Dior again as much as I like their products
Bought a headphones that failed after one week Send back to the company the faulty item but no return comunication nor refund received I would strongly recommend to avoid them
Never ever again over charged for imaginary repairs holding enormous funds for extended periods of time Never again
I had ordered one rb3183 0n 14 th january worth rs 8959 inr  it has not received yet on 19 th i got an email telling some story about some customs duty issue with my order 
2 weeks and my order havent been shipped What else to write
If youre anything less than a gold member of QFs Frequent Flyer program youre treated like a real pleb and travel is even more unpleasant than it already is But even if you have worked hard to accumulate points and status your ability to use those hard earned points is limited Firstly the real international reward seats are extraordinarily limited and unless you book well in advance Im talking 6 months you will not find anything close to adequate Then if you manage to score it you then have to pay fees  charges in cash that can be quite a lump For example for 2 business class tickets MelBali with Jetstar youll pay about 950 in fees  charges If you want to negate this with points then the amount of points required can be more than the points you used to get the tickets in the first place
Hence lesson here is theyll gouge you one way or another and QF does not care whether you go elsewhere or not because they pretty much are a monopoly player in Australia
This doesnt happen with Virgin FF rewards Even when youre charged some fees  charges they are very small usually less than 100 If Virgin flew to more destinations more frequently so that business travellers had real choice I would dump QF altogether rather than sharing my business between them like I have to now
I had an upcoming event I needed some help with and sent out a Quote request The next day Gigsalad had taken down my Quote request I still have not received a response from the company as to why
They failed to find talent for an event in the past as well
Reading all their horrible reviews gave me the names of competitors to try so at least I have somewhere else to look
Hello and thank you for your email
I would love to share my positive experience with diorcom but unfortunately I dont have the best first online order experience
On January 13th I place a small fragrance order and with ought notification the order has been cancelled  there is no way for me to see the reason
I sent tried number of times to call the provided telephone number Fragrance  Beauty however was directed to leave a voice message each time

When I contacted Ace you made it seem like these were the only tickets left And maybe they were the only ones you had But the cost to me was 178 and the face value was 14 and when we arrived at the rink it was 70 empty So I feel cheated and will not deal with Ace again for my tickets The game itself was great thats why two stars and not one I feel ripped off
I was rushed  and overcharged never going back 
Wide range of clothing with good sales yet the delivery takes too LON as if the parcel walks from the store to your houseits been a week since I placed an order and Im still waiting it to arrive from England to Greeceto Greece not to Australia
Noone bothered to check our car if they had they would off discovered only 7 psi air in the tyresalso paid for a baby seat that was ill fitting they kept on telling us to adjust the straps they were adjusted as tight as could bethe seat was missing the insert the lady told us to hire from elsewhere then but we needed to get there with a proper baby seat
Extremely awkward difficult and frustrating to get any details of my account
I have a lot of trouble getting my questions answered I submitted an inquiry three weeks ago and got a response today not at all answering my question The lack of understanding and response time has caused me to decide to cancel my membership and look elsewhere for my athletic needs
Poor servicepaid for next day delivery and parts arrived 5 days later with no apology Will never buy from them again had a car up on ramps for a week waiting for the parts
What can I say about my experience The sale process was great however a true test of an organisation comes into play with its after sales customer service I was provided unclear guidance on the refund process and have been extremely dissatisfied with the way in which my query has been dealt with
Overall I am extremely disappointed and will be advising my friends and family to stay clear
Terrible experience My glasses wont stay on First I contacted when a screw fell out to try to get a new one sent I was told they would look into it and let me know The next day I got an email with a RMA without explaination I cant return the glasses because they are my only pair
Eventually after contacting a couple more time some new screws were sent Wrong screws though
I called again to try to get the right screw sent I was told a week ago that the employee I talked to me would try and get back to me by the next day I left her a message yesterday and have not heard back
Terrible experience My glasses wont stay on my face

I did not know that if I failed to purchase something each month my account would be charge 50 The items I purchased are nice but overpriced and not worth the hassle of ordering something every month whether or not I want to Canceling immediately and advising my friends not to join this site
They dont fix into the fixing points and turn up at the edges the heel protector is in the wrong place also nearly warn through after a couple of weeks
Poor quality not impressed Will not use again
I ordered the stripe jumpsuit and when it arrived the quality was very bad so I had to return 
Mobilefun asked me to ship back the item for a product exchange due to malfunction within a year of purchase However after two months they refused to refund exchange nor returning the item back to me
Sold me a defective product told me to acclimate floor for 57 days I did for 10 days Inspection from manufacture came out and said nothing wrong with floor and it is because it wasnt acclimated 15 days
Terrible Dont use them they will rip you off Poor business practices
I reviewed the packaging experience extensively at the AUSBB forum under the title Muscle Motion bars from GymDirectcomau
I had to pay 270 nok extra to pay with VISA in stead of MasterCard This tax was hard to notice since this tax was discreet added to the total sum while choosing payment Neither was I informed that different payments could relsult in extra taxes in the box where i chose payment and gave up card information This information was hidden unlike all other extra services like eg extra insurances and you had to open a meny bar to see this cost I didnt noticed this until after I had purcased the ticket and I would never have bought my ticked if I had seen this before clicking buy Its obvious to me that they intensionally didnt give better information about this extra tax I findt this way of hiding extra costs disgusting and its a petty way of tricking money from customers
they offered intl express via DHL 2 days shipping now they offer very slow international shipping same price and takes longer The reps never respond in a timely manner Customer service is closed on the weekends
very bad service and i dont recommended any body 
A bit pricey but worth the ease
Digital booking through Vroom Vroom Vroom was great Tick
Face to face car pick up was a disaster Staff unthinkingly enforced obscure TnCs re pick up times resulting in unnecessary stress conflict and to ice the pointless melodrama a lower revenue outcome for RedSpot
Better staff training and more sensible business protocolsintegration would have prevented this silly outcome
Car also had constant screeching noise brakes which was both annoying and unnerving Not sure why maintenance didnt pick this up before passing to customers
I was working away and the water supply to my flat was off The problem was a stopcock was turned off in the hallway outside my flat It took two visits and over 1000 to resolve this including replacing part of a trap under the sink The plumber was obviously competent and was pleasant enough and I was very relieved that the problem was eventually fixed I guess the problem may lie in the gig economy approach where you are in the hands of a freelancer and the company itself doesnt oversee whether the work is appropriate etc
My experiences is the 00mg Strawberry taste like Celery it could do with more strawberry
I booked for one night December 14th and it said I could cancel by December 10th a few days before Then I entered by credit card info and it said they were charging the full amount now The fine print say I can only cancel the 2nd or 3rd day and not the first night Very misleading info
Found same product elsewhere for 35 the pricesigh
Shipping was quick I guess so theres that
I did not fly i could fly next day Nobody told us about compensation
I will not recommend to fly with Pegasus and buy packet with TUI
I have taken CleanseMax for two years now however this latest batch was bad caused severe cramping and diarrhea I emailed PureFormulas Customer Service 3 days ago and never received a reply so I had to place a call this morning They are replacing the order so I will see if there is an improvement with another batch The rep was very helpful just disappointed that my email was never replied to and I had to follow up again myself
Always happy but this shipment was not packed well  the cardboard shipping split  the bags came out of the box it was shipped in
Customer service was not available online after purchase even though it was early evening Had to call next morning Person taking my call was very good and forwarded tix promptly
Betrugsmasche
I will go for other provider after 12 months contract energia way too dear than other companies disappoint
I Prepaid for a reservation 29785437 and it has been weeks of back and forth with customer service and the hotel still does not have the reservation info
They basically took my money and I have no hotel at this point If you call Amomas sales answers almost right away but customer service makes you wait for over 20 minutes each time and you only get automated replies if you try to contact their customer service via email
This website is a huge waste of money and time Avoid at all costs

Journal
Update Feb 21
After publically promising on TrustPilot that someone would reach out to me to resolve the issue Nobody from Amomas team reached out Will update on progress or lack of progress here daily
Update Feb 22
Just got an email stating something that I was told over 10 days ago very similar message and still no resolution in sight
Our supplier is still discussing with the hotel the case which I have opened on your behalf and as soon as I receive their final resolution I will revert to you with all of the necessary information
It has been over two weeks since my order has shipped and has not yet arrived
The initial experience was fine website easy to use butafter putting my car registration into the site it turns out the the part sent didnt actually match my car After much coming and going with customer service and having to dismantle my car again to take pictures to show the adviser that it didnt fit they agreed and said to send it back However MicksGarage said they were unable to refund me for the postage it cost to send me the part or the cost I had to incur to send the incorrect product back to them recorded delivery  even though this error was their own
Would not recommend this company to anybody else or use again myself
I would be very happy to send a great review if I could only receive my product
We had a confirmation email from carhorecomau yet tedspot would not honor it
We ended up resolving with carhirecomau who were very helpful
The staff member at Redspot was less than helpful with a not my problem attitude Very disappointing experience
They are terrible My dad passed away suddenly and my mother did not feel like going to Hawaii with us We called Air Canada and explained what happen They advise us that we are eligible for a refund but since we booked flighthub we would need to deal with flighthubca and they would be the one to process our refund Called flighthub 4x Very RUDE customer service and even the supervisor I always book my flights with flighthub but now never again
I ordered flowers to be delivered to my girlfriend on the 14th February Valentines Day The order was placed on the 12th February Delivery was confirmed for the 14th
On the 14th I was waiting for the delivery to arrive no show
The flowers were delivered the afternoon of the 15th  they may as well not have arrived at all
Do not use this service for any special occasion Euroflorist cannot get a simple flower delivery done
Pathetic and completely unaceaptable service
You basically just stole my money
Luckily I have an amazing girlfriend that understood
Thank you for nothing Euroflorist
Will eventually go down

My daughter lives in Venice California and contracted with WAG to walk her 9 pound mixed breed on Saturday night February 11 while she was at a business related event  The three year old spayed female is in a first floor apartment in a home with a regular and screened in door plus a gated yard The WAG walker claims the dog ran from the apartment and burrowed under the fence and ran away This is uncharacteristic behavior for this animal WAG did not assist in the search and recovery and did not even post a picture provided on their local website to assist in finding the dog The dog was recovered sixteen hours later and was treated and released from a vetinary hospital At no time after the dog got loose did WAG contact my daughter or assist in any wayKnow when you do business with this firm that they do not stand up for the animals they pretend to care about

IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING BAD EXPERIENCES WITH SAMMY GO SHOP YESSTYLECOM CHWCL OUT THEIR REVIEWS
I ordered two shirts and had a 20 off coupon with no minimum I was told both were in stock and would be shipped to my home Then I got an email saying only one of the shirts was in stock When I told the rep I didnt want another color just apply the 20 coupon to the one shirt they DID have in stock they refused to do so and only applied 10 or half because I only got half my order Is it MY fault you went out of stock on an item Why should I lose 12 the value of my coupon because you screwed up
In response to DXLs response NO it did not rectify my problem to force me to buy another shirt in a color I did not want or lose half my coupon I asked them to apply the full 20 coupon to the one shirt that DID ship since I did not want another shirt in a color I didnt like but they wouldnt do that so I was forced to buy another item in order to keep my full coupon value Thats fraud and I hope you made a lot on the extra shirt because you lost me as a lifelong customer so I hope that ROI is worth it for you
To the second response from DXL I did NOT get an email from you Please call me at 7187536148 to discuss
The frame was cut all the way to the wall and to the light fixture above I might have been off an eigth of an inch in my measurement Person I talked to could only say that we made it with the measurements given I raised the light fixture and hammered in the frame with a rubber mallet It looks good but not as good as it could have
My suggestion Leave an eigth of an inch on all sides for a smoother fit
Hope DXcom reads this review and answer me back Their phone number for Custom Service is always offline DXcom is good if you receive your purchase From the moment you have a problem with shipping youre on your own I put an order on Dec 20th 2016 Order number 161220001098043067 Two packages were sent via China Post on Dec 23rd and Dec 26th On Feb 2nd I opened a ticked because no package has ever arrived home Truth is DXcom lost tracking of them with China Post Today Feb 13th I was still waiting for Staff to contact me I managed to chat with Claudia from Customer Service She told me to wait more for Ticket Service answer Nope Claudia Sorry No more waiting I just called my credit card to cancel the deal and Im now officially disputing the purchase And DXcom lost another good client of course
The vet who operated on my cat for a urinary blockage recommended buying Hills prescription diet food from Chewycom I ordered a shipment this past Monday Feb I3 and made sure to spend 5655 well over the required 49 for free 12 day shipment because my cat needed the food quickly
Today Thurs Feb 16 I checked the status to see why my shipment hadnt arrived yet The tracking order said it hadnt left the warehouse yet When I called customer service they gave me some song and dance about I ordered on a Monday and they had to check with the vet they require you put the vets info on the order for prescription food I had entered all the info and there was no reason for the delay
The rep said shell call the vet now but clearly the order wasnt shipping any time soon Im not sure Ill trust this company again
Very disappointed customer
Booking was straightforward however I did take collision damage waver not realising it was a per day rate but thats my fault
However when email booking came through it has pick up from 10am and drop off 10am I had given flight details arriving 12pm and leaving 56 pm have tried 4 times to get through on phone only to be left on hold for 2030 mins have a feeling Im going to get hit for another days hire for extra hours this is why Im not satisfied
I booked my flight today through bravofly on skyscanner and the rate on the bravofly page was AUD 2217  Rates taxes and fees included I even have a pint screen of the page as proof as I had read the negative comments However I have been charged almost AUD 100 extra
We received our chairs using white glove service Company did not bother to make sure they had plugged in everything We had to do it We watched a show that evening The next morning we woke with backaches and decided to return chairs 30 restocking fee transport fees plus we were told we had to package the chairs When I responded the White Glove Company took the packing materialI was told to get little boxes open them up and tape them together We are 69 years old and those chairs are heavy Totally uninterested in being helpful Would not recommend this company ever
Explained as maybe product not instock or maybe credit problem my amex charged pending or maybe i didnt rate as a client Very vague

Unfortunately they dont tell you for a week if your order is on backorder I paid over 200 for Costa Del Mar sunglasses that I now have to wait at least a month to receive In the confirmation email they promise an update within 35 days of purchase well I had to call the company just to find out what was going on on day 6 I am also a student and never received a 10 discount Not worth the hassle of trying to discuss this with them Good luck maybe yours are in stock I thought this would be easy and now I am going to a birthday party with an IOU I wont be using them anymore and I wouldnt recommend them to anyone Large selection is deceiving On the plus side I can stop getting my hopes up each day when the mail is delivered
I bought a bike from Bikes2uDirect which came with bent forks so it was impossible to fix the front wheel on When I emailed the company responded they cannot see the fault on the pictures I sent I had to resend photos and argue to finally get a replacement The replacement came with decentred back wheel and crushed breaks cable When I called to ask for a compensation for the price of a new cable the person I spoke to suggested that I crushed the cable myself on my way to the cycle shop The light I bought from them didnt work and after a week of using the bike the breaks started making such awfully loud noise it was impossible to use them Turned out the breaks need to be changed and when I contacted the company again I was refused the compensation for that as well
It really is the worst customer service and the worst product I ever received in London really recommend you avoid them
For starters I had problems with getting into my course material I actually figured how to get into it on my own as it took a few day for the course material to be accessible The only support is by email When I finally went through my bank for a refund i received a call from them which was from a middle eastern country This is not an American company They offered a refund of the course if i changed my rating soo they could look good Well I changed it from one star to two starsI highly suggest you take your money and your time some place else for needed credits As the CPR and First Aid material was out dated and lacking any real information The yoga course is not highly prized if you actually want to become an instructor It is ok if your just wanting some information than it is cheaper than the book store It you are trying to quickly build a resume this is a fast option other than that i do not recommend sorry to say
Both the keys I ordered did not work in the locks
some of the flowerrs were not fresh and had to be thrown away 1 day later
the goods delivered were not te ones ordered
a really bad experience
I bought high end designer frames from them There was a design or manufacturing defect and they refused to cover broken frame under their warranty They returned the frames at my expense as repaired  and repaired the wrong side I then sent back at my expense  and they claimed to have sent them to the manufacturer They were cagey when talking on phone but they had no documentation from manufacturer that they had been ever evaluated saying it was done on the phone I contacted the manufacturer and they told me that they had no record of GoOptic ever contacting them gave me a different place to get the warranty work done
I reported them to BBB They are working the case but they say Go Optic has an F rating which is the worst they can give I also reported them to California Attorney General and they are working on that as well
In short AVOID GoOptic You will get slow poor service the warranty was worthless and life is too short to do business with people like this
Just received our canvas print after 6 days Be aware this company in spite of having a uk website address are based in Germany We paid 2790 for an out of focus print of very poor quality Would not recommend
Our flight got cancelled and the support for this problem was inexistent Do not use this website
Measured my wall
Received blinds shorter than this
Blinds have an adjustable mechanism on one side therefore wouldve expected the blinds to be a couple of cm wider than the size given
Was told to reorder with discount
Was told I cant side fix even though the website and instructions say you can
Would not recommend at all
havent seen any change
I placed an order on their website and three weeks later I had received no confirmation of delivery  delivery number I rang their customer service numbers and they all kept ringing out After putting a complaint on this website three weeks after my order I had my first response from them advising me that I would have a shipping number Keep in mind that this was due for delivery within 10 15 days
A customer shouldnt have to write on this to get an order number  confirmation  response from a store
The company dont answer their phone nor do they have a voicemail facility
I eventually received the chairs I ordered a couple of weeks after the delivery timescale they state on their website  two of four are good quality and the other two came with the wrong screws lengths
They need to improve on their customer service Instead of apologising and correcting their customer service  they reported my review
On 12182016 I purchased a Wltoys F959 SkyKing RC Airplane for 4599    The airplane arrived damage inside the box I emailed TomTop several times and even included pictures of the damaged part I asked TomTop for a complete replacement or just replace the part that was broken or send me a return shipping label so I could send the damaged airplane back to TomTop for a refund After 4 weeks and several emails back and forth with TopTop their latest email to me was completely in CHINEESE I was so furious I do not read or write CHINEESE The damage to the airplane made it unable to fly I was so mad I just threw the airplane in the trash and took the loss for 4599   
I WILL NEVER BUY FROM TOMTOP AGAIN
first when I made the order on the shipment cost information was not at all clear so I proceeded with the payment to see the actual cost when I came down I noticed that there were no costs so I did the  order at once making the payment I was required to pay as a result of the shipping cost of up to 15  for only 4 items unacceptable and disappointing I felt compelled to pay a price for which I was not informed earlier also the stuff has arrived the quality is excellent and the smaller size of those written moreover lacks a dress and I could not contact the site as it does not have available an email I left a ticket but did not receive answers information about why it has not received the dress and if it will arrived and when
but if the problem were to be solved and the dress will like me it will increase the stars up to 4
Ridiculous cant use voucher online and if u buy something online through paypal you cant grt a refund in store
Order was placed on January 2nd Today is January 14th and I still dont have it Safe to say Im not happy
I paid for a 30 dark red roses bouquet they deliver 15 dark red roses bouquet 
The intro prices that I was seeing on the website werent applied to my order I feel like I need to call customer service now to see why I was charged more than I expected  just makes this whole process more annoying  time consuming

This company uses unsolicited email spam to market themselves
And since they seem to have no qualms about buying maillists from suppliers they probably have no problem selling mail adresses either So if you give them your email you can probably be sure to get loads and loads of spam
I would buy from someone else since there are many alternate suppliers
After reviewing my bills vs the agreed and best rates available from Energia I found that I am being overcharged on both the standing charges and units rates
I found the EXACT SAME products on another health supplement website for 35 less The product Kavinace from NeuroScience 120 capsules was 8200 on PureFormulas and I found it for 5400 elsewhere After further investigation I also found the other supplements I purchased from PureFormulas to be approximately 25 higher Unfortunate
My book had water marks and mildew It should have gone in the garbage I will never buy a thrift book again
Thank you

I am very disappointed with the service I received today When I came in to pick up the phone at first they could not find it They said it was brought to the front desk while the person at the desk was at lunch After looking around they finally found it in a bag with someone elses name on it The girl at the front desk did not seem concerned that my phone was in the bag for someone else
Although the display was fixed when I turned the phone over I noticed it was cracked pretty bad on the back The girl informed me that this is the chance you take when they take your phone apart She said they could fix it for another 70 I just paid 239 to fix the front and Fox Paw wants me to pay more to fix the damage they did
Again the girl was not concerned She told me that if I kept it in a case I wouldnt have to worry about the cracks in the back
Terrible customer service will not recommend them to anyone and will not use them again
No good so far
Horrible No contact services which work in India No one answers the calls Ive been trying to contact for 2 weeks now to change my travel dates No one to assist No reply to emails Dont ever use the service

Here is our experience of doyouspain the dispute has only just finished after 5 months with the credit card company in our favour
DoYouSpain car rental Schedule of Events
from 1st  8th August 2016
13th April Jeep booked for 11 days from 1st August with DoYouSpaincom and full payment of 145703 charged to credit card plus foreign exchange fee of 4006 We thought this was expensive for car hire however decided it was worth it for a luxury car
1st August Jeep Wrangler collected from K10 Rent A Car Ibiza at the airport but damage to car was not noted on the vehicle inspection report see attachment They told us this was because they had forgotten to insert a carbon copy which we knew not to be correct as the rest of the information had copied over clearly As a precaution we took our own photosThey asked for the credit card used for our booking and debited 1500 euros They did not make it clear that this would be charged immediately We also noted that there was no sign of a manual or registration documents in the car which is a legal requirement in Spain
3rd  6th August  We used the car to drive to a beach on each of these 4 days and to a local restaurant on 3 evenings The island is only 24 miles long and we estimated that we had probably covered about 100 miles at the most The fuel tank was just over a quarter full when we picked it up and we paid another 60 euros for petrol We were aware of the high insurance excess plus we have 2 small children and the car was driven with great care However the clutch pedal always seemed stiff and after we turned the engine off there was a burning smell Initially we assumed that was possibly normal for a Jeep
7th August  As a precaution we thought it best to call the car hire company to mention the burning smell They told us to call their mechanic and ask him to come to our hotel We did this through the Spanish speaking receptionist at the hotel and were surprised that K10 asked us to arrange for the mechanic to look at the car
8th August  The mechanic took the car from our hotel at 9am and asked us to call for an update at 11am We did this and were surprised to be told that the car would not be delivered back to the hotel but we had to go to Ibiza Town at 8pm to collect the car We asked if K10 rent a car would cover the cost of the taxi and were told we had to pay for a taxi as it was our fault that the car was damaged Our hotel made several attempts to call the K10 office at the airport and the office in Ibiza Town to ask for more details K10 were very rude and hung up on two occasions continuously saying that the clutch had broken and we had caused the damage We took a taxi to the office in Ibiza town where they notified us that the car would be handed over once we signed a document We did not understand the language nor the figures Quote d on the document so refused to sign We were advised to go to another K10 office in Ibiza Town but we were not allow to hold onto the document until we signed We would have welcomed the opportunity to discuss the document with someone who could translate it On arrival at the other office we were faced with the same accusations that we had broken the clutch When asked about the history of the car we were told that it was 2 years old which we questioned as there was over 50000 km of mileage recorded meaning about 500 kms per week This would be difficult on such a small island I asked about the service history but they refused to discuss it Again they printed the same document in Spanish and demanded a signature for us to accept liability for the damage We asked to see the garages invoice or at least the mechanics report as we wished to understand how we could have broken the clutch having driven the car a very few miles compared to the mileage completed by previous drivers This was not available but they would email it the next day once we signed the reportThe man in the office would not let us read the document and when we asked for a translation he said it was exactly the same as our original contract I have attached the original contract and the unsigned document and clearly they are not the same My wife tried to take a photo of the document and they physically restrained her to prevent her taking pictures When we asked about the total bill as the figures that we could see were confusing he said it came to 159493 euros After much arguing my wife spotted a copy of the document on the printer so she picked it up and very quickly left the office see attached The total bill for the supposed damage is over 3000 euros We were reluctant to contact the company again as they seemed comfortable to resort to violence at the time and we were all very distressed especially our 2 young daughters
9th 12th August  we had no car so had to pay for taxis Needless to say the mechanics report was also not emailed With the help of our hotel we attended a meeting at the Vehicle Registration office in Ibiza town where we obtained a copy of the Jeeps history attached As you will see it is 6 years old not 2 with the next service due next month and several thousand kilometres completed since the last service
Further to our credit card companys enquiries doyouspain returned a carbon copy of a signed agreement to admit that the damage was our responsibility My signature had been forged and a date of 9th August time 6pm entered as when the car was returned On this date and at this time we were on Formentera island and have restaurant receipts and photos to prove this which were forwarded to our credit card company for them to question doyouspain Funnily enough we heard no more from doyouspain and needless to say we do not recommend them as a professional car hire firm nor will we ever use them again
I can barely begin on my disappointment through the years with Starbucks I have tried being a loyal customer became a gold card member through loyalty to the brand I have had my card stolen a couple times and getting it sent to me has been a long and difficult process In the mean time I lose rewards and cannot collect points so I keep losing what I am trying to hard to earn Why do points expire So many of my reqards have been lost that way I am at the point of giving up and going to a local place with a simple punch card I have lost my birthday rewards for not using it fast enough too They should not be ezpiring like that Also many times I am highly disappointed by the quality of my drink People burn it or make it taste weird and many times I wait a long time for my drink and have terrible customer service Between all of it I just think I am going to finally stop going there
Didnt tell me that when I bought a bed that if I didnt like it I could return it but would be stuck with the box springs I paid over 3000 dollars for the bed got back 24900 I hope Grand enjoys because Ill never buy from them again
I ordered my shoes on 1228 I received the order confirmation and tracking information with expected date of delivery On the actual day I looked to see where my packed is just to find out they printed the wrong address on my package I continued to call their customer service and kept getting the automated voice When I finally got a hold of a person on 0119 they told me it was my address was too long My issue is how come their system didnt shorten my address to make my package deliverable Then when I asked can I get it redelivered she told me they dont have my shoe in stock any more I was wondering if it was ever shipped out in the first place Had I never Called about this situation they would have kept my money and I wouldve never received any shoes
Even I was clearly in fault about having cause damage to one wheel i did not think that a simple metal wheel to replace and charged more than 330AUD 
We booked a nice Hotel in Paris through Amoma we put in the right date but when we saw the reservation it was a different date We have tried to contact Amoma and then they advised us to cancel ur booking only to leave us with no room and no money back All we wanted was to change the dates of the booking so we called the hotel ourself and they told us it would have been no problem to just change the dates but by that time Amoma had already made us cancel the booking BAD ADDVISMENT  They make everything a problem when apparently it never was 
this is not the first time now i have had the issue where i been sold a code that is invalid
Did not turn on my electricity yesterday as scheduled Very disappointing Hoping they will show up today
Delivery took over an hour not the 40mins indicated upon ordering when it finally arrived we were left short our rice and food was lukewarm rice was delivered 30mins later after original delivery Will never order again
I have placed my first order with snapfish unfortunately I was unsatisfied with the service as most of the printouts I received were cropped out incorrectly other photos of same dimensions were fine
I also purchased an 812 photo and it was cropped too Very disappointed Wont recommend
They show product in stock with a supposedly shipping within 2 days but after several phone calls with a promise that on the day of the calls product was being shipped that day 2 12 weeks later no product but the charged me immediately
After the snafu with my prescription receiving 2 emails saying they couldnt accept my script because it was modified which it had not and then finally scanning and sending the original pink copy my script was finally acceptedmy contacts finally said shipped at one point delivery said 113 I thought awesome not badbut nothing showed nothing arrived weekend came and went and finally delivery status was updated for delivery todaywell 9pm has come and gone and I receive a message that my contacts are undeliverable as addressedI checked and triple checked and theres nothing wrong with my addressthis is so not the coolest first impression to make at allif you want cheap contacts this might be your first choice but fast and speedy service they definitely are not
I paid a premium price to get something worth for several years only to realize that the end product had made too many compromises
1 the quality of wheels were bad and made a lot of noises on pathways My existing Muji luggage case made smaller noise and Muji only cost me onethird of the price tag
2 no side handle so if I put it on top cabin of trains I have to turn it 90 degrees before I can get to the handle
3 battery pack place is a joke I know that you may have to consider air safety control and hence made it a power bank but the way to open and use it simply does not match what was described in the Kickstarter campaign
4 the worst part it does not stand up straight and instead it got a 10degree of inclination and it means if I put something a little large on top like a laptop backpack then it will simply fall over as a whole
Sorry for this bad review but I simply have no reason to be happy at all now I have to buy another luggage case so as to replace it
I will not book with flight hub again Everytime I tried to book my flight they cancelled it saying it was no longer available I would search for a new flight and the old one would still show up saying it has 7 tickets available This happened 4 times Finally I called them and the customer service agent didnt even speak enough English to help me I went through 3 before someone finally told me that flight should be taken down Though listed multiple times in the same search window and repeat searches I asked what they can do to help and they said to not book through them As I was talking to them I saw a flight with a different airline which actually let me book it then they charged me the wrong amount When I called customer service back she said that the price changed from when I confirmed to when payment was accepted This was less than 1 min and I didnt confirm the price I was charged She told me there was nothing they can do Never again With so many other booking companies out there use a different one
Robbers Didnt trust that site I never received any items

The amount I had to spend on the car almost doubled with the full insurance which was 35day usually its 710 I went for it because it was the cheapest and I work for a not for profit and was surprised by the amount of the insurance which wasnt made clear when I booked
But learn to Manager better Is the KEy for to stay Out Of debt
Just booked a flight with flighthub from Ottawa to Florida flying Air Canada thinking it was the cheapest fare but A few moments later I found the same exact flight on Air Canada Website for over 40 cheaper I contacted Flighthub to cancel as i found a cheaper rate but the they said they would charge for the cancellation so asked for a credit instead and they refused They were willing to lose a customer and risk a bad review instead I should have looked into flighthub more carefully before booking because I found that the BBB has over 600 complaints and that they have lost their BBB accreditation Do not used Flighthub to book a flight as you can find cheaper flights elsewhere
I believe that this site is just here to collect your data Beware
I created an account and proceeded to top up a support carrier in a supported country Surprise Transaction Failed so automatically on their FAQ type in Failed to see what could have gone wrong reading up it states that they will try to charge again What The money is already withheld from the previous transaction and they will try again What in Gods world are you thinking
I will not recommend this service to anyone and I know that they will not post this to their site as it only shows the Good reviews probably done by their own team since I see many unsatisfactory reviews on TrustPilot
To me this site is deceiving and able to collect data from you I will always recommend using a third party service such as PayPal to avoid providing your card details to this people
I requested my refund immediately by email as I do not want to deal with this company anymore For those who decide to use the service beware
Modification after they replied
So if there was issue when I created my account why would you let me use my PayPal account Wouldnt be better to clarify that there were security checks pending on the account before you let anyone use their card Say what you want it seems that you are very defensive but this site is garbage you always try to blame the user for the issues specially for bad reviews Fix you site your process and these bad reviews will go away I was not given any indication that my account was pending or needed verification You might be defensive because it is your business but please understand that you are messing with peoples money yes you might refund the transaction which takes 710 business days to reflect back on their card if that was the only money to help out a friend with a top up I would be out of luck for at least 7 days That is not a solution once you understand that and fix the process you will have less complaints
I rented a car in january with Goldcar through AutoEurope
I paid extra for the full insurance with AutoEurope
But when I went to the Goldcar desk at Alicante Airport the woman told me that the insurance I had bought with AutoEurope wasnt valid and I had to pay extra 120 euro  tax for a new insurance with Goldcar I had paid total 90 euros for car rental  insurance with AutoEurope
I called AutoEurope when I was I the desk and handed my phone to the Goldcar women at the desk and they argued for some time because AutoEurope insisted that the insurance I had bought with them was valid
I was traveling alone with my daugter 25 years old so after 3040 minutes I had to pay the insurance and get the car
The lady at the Goldcar desk had clearly lied to me the sell me extra insurance that I didnt needed because I was already covered at AutoEurope
I can now see that Goldcar has recently been fined aprox 2 mill euros for selling insurance to customers that they didnt need
I was scammed unfortunately I have written their customer service but expect to get a new lie from them and no refund
Dont EVER use this Car Rental Company they will lie to oyu to sell useless insurance And they exploit that customers dont know the jungle of car rental insurance
It is not delivered it was a shame for valentines day I have sent an email for refund but there is not any answer
1 We were asked to register all scratches of a car There were scratches everywhere and it was dark outside It was very difficult to register all damages of a car Why they rent a car which was not checked at drop off Each missing scratch would cost lots of money Price of full insurance is not reasonable
2 The car had summer tires and damaged chains one link was broken We had to fix them in a local garage next day Thankfully we have noticed that and did not damaged cars brakes
3 Pick up process took approximately 40 min 20 papers 20 car checking Imagine few persons standing in front of you
4 One of rented cars had summer diesel so it has frozen in the mountains lots of stress and headache
5 We were not allowed to cross France border sad it was the same ski resort with Italy
Next time i will pay 20 for another company
The website advertises free returns Disappointed to discover I had to pay for returns as my purchases were on sale This was hidden in the fine print
VERY GOOD THANKS SO MUCH 
I called them because I was unhappy with one of the components of the pen I was promised an email to see if they could offer more something else
They never contacted me again To them I say goodbye
Too many other stores to do business with that actually care about people and honor their word because their word stinks
I ordered 2 pair of glasses and a pair of rx shades on 012417 I get an email telling me that one of the frames that I ordered was discontinued and one was back ordered I was truly upset with that because if the frames that I wanted was unavailable they should have not been offered on the website I then started communicating with a rep named Frances that informed me about the issue I then proceeded to re do my order and and get something different I informed Frances that of my changes to my order in which i requested the Polo PH2166 in the Shiny Jerry Tortoise and the Shiny Black and no changes to the order for the shades Frances completely dropped the ball with my order She ended up cancelling my order for the back ordered Polo PH 2123 and Exchanged the order for the Polo PH2166 Shiny Black to the Shiny Jerry Tortoise Instead of exchanging the back ordered Polo PH2123 for the Polo PH 2166 Shiny Jerry Tortoise So far I have receive the Shades Polo PH4098 Top Black on Jerry Tortoise and the Polo PH2166 Shiny Jerry Tortoise which arrived a week ago I then called FramesDirect inquiring about my order and spoke with a different rep in which I explained my concerns The rep appeared like she understood my concerns and assured me that she will fix the issue but she dropped the ball I then received a call from Frances late last week apologizing for the mix up and assured me that she will fixed the mistake and get my glasses ordered Now an entire week pass by and I have not received an email confirming my order Once again I called inquiring about my order only to find out that Frances never submitted the order Now its 021617 still no order for my glasses however the rep that took the call Nelly understood my frustration and took control of the entire issue placed my order for my glasses I even received the email notification Now I am happy I get a call from Nelly today informing me that the vendor informed her that the glasses that I want are no longer available in The US and will have to be shipped form their overseas location which will take an additional 11  15 days in order to receive the frame and another 5  8 days to add the lenses Now I am COMPLETELY UPSET that Frances dropped the ball At the end of the day my original order started on 012417 and will not complete until sometime in March I must give Extremely HIGH praises to Nelly for contacting me and keeping me the loop Her professionalism is 20 cuts above the rest and I must say she is Heaven sent GREAT JOB NELLY

I purchased a Sprint last year and I messed up the printhead The maintenance station did something strange so it needed repairs as well Sent the machine in paid 12 upfront for repairs It took me a month to come up with the other 12 Once paid I was promised my machine wi a week Anajet shipped it to the wrong person It took a month after that for me to get my machine back While I wanted some financial compensation for all of the money lost the committee thought it was fair to give me
1000 in products and extended warranty Not what I really preferrred I missed the entire month of December for sales huge for new business owner and retail sales lost 3 clients and missed four major festivals After receiving my machine back this month it appears as though the motherboard may need replacing Something they shouldve seen before shipping it back to me Now I have to ship the machine back for repairs Spoke with manager for Tech Support Super rude He didnt listen to my concerns immediately told me what he wasnt going to do Missed out on doing business with two new customers had to cancel photo shoot and losing another month for business opportunities This has been the worse customer service experience I wont purchase my upgrade machine from Anajet
the product is not lkike I thought
It took me an hour to book a onenight reservation
Screed kept going blank
Had to reinput info several times
Initially I want to buy a pair of Ray Bans the Anaconda Around 200 After reading reviews  some saying that the glasses are twisted and crooked  decided to go with a cheapest choice  Polaroid  And u know what They are TWISTED AND CROOKED Tryied to call customer service  no answer back  Send them mails  no answer  Cant use my sunglasses  and to send them back will cost HALF of their price  Bottom line Crap 
Ordered a DS game on the 5th December 2016
2 weeks later I was getting worried as it was coming up to Christmas I emailed them a few times and they said it was on its way
As it got closer and closer to Christmas I ended up buying the game online elsewhere and it turned up just 2 days after ordering it The game I ordered with play Asia still wasnt with me for Christmas
10th January 2017 and the game finally turns up I sent it straight back the day I got it and asked for my money back but all I got back was clueless replies
Its now 25th January 2017 and I still dont have my money back
That is what I call fcking bad customer service and I wouldnt chance it if I were someone else
The delivery service this company uses is terrible I wasnt home on their first attempt so a card was left I then rearranged for it to be left with a neighbour the next day again just a card was left I then took the next afternoon off work to ensure I personally recieved the parcel I was sent an email that morning to say my parcel was been help at their main depot I ended up cancelling my entire order after still not having my items a week after purchasing Wont use this site again
I spoke to a rep he hung up on me mid sentence at first I though it was a mistake but he never called back I guess he figured out that he couldnt get any money from me I just get the info I needed straight from the government website so I guess this company is irrelevant and just out to make money You can also get the info you need from 1 800 OCanada

You should also accept AMEX as a paymeny methot That a great inconvenience
Reaching out to your customer service for refund for charges on POF account that was closed in November Representative charged my account instead of refund Called back and was told that 5000 was not much and I could afford it I will be filing fraudulent charges for this transaction
Tried to order RAM from these guys
Said it was in stock took my credit card information the next day I was emailed about my items not being able to be sent not being in stock and not even in MCS possession
Pretty horrible in our technological age to be selling things that you are not in possession of and especially not keeping a current stock of items that you are trying to sell of someone elses
The customer service agent offered me one alternative type of RAM that was a slower speed and didnt have a heat sink Although it was a good price it was totally inferior RAM
Did receive a refund Awaiting the details on my credit card Hopefully wont have any more problems with this place I definitely wont make another purchase from them
I purchased trampoline online 20th December for my daughters Christmas present Website said if done by 20th will receive by 24th My trampoline did not arrive for another two weeks Received trampoline and there were no springs in package or pole padding Took until February to have springs with pole pading sent out to me I was only credited 40 refund I paid over 500 for these products that are more expensive but I got on sale I receive the springs and pole pading The springs are the incorrect size New correct springs were sent out to me following week with pole pading Upon assembling basketball hoop discovered back metal frame was left out of package Now 18 Feb and waiting for this Staff are very poor at communicating with you and Im disgusted with the lack of care and customer service I will never be using this company ever again and I highly dont recommend them A real shame as the product good quality Bunch of monkeys to say the very least
I have found DoyouSpain to be the most devious and untrustworthy car rental brokers  They may well be the cheapest in Tenerife however rest assured that you get what you pay for in this case you pay a little but get nothing
They use euro to pound conversion rates that never exist to con you into booking and then when your bank statements arrive sure enough you get nothing like the Quote d exchange rate
They also hide within the terms and conditions in small print the fact that you will have to pay a mandatory refuelling charge of anything between 25 and 35 which is nonrefundable in addition to the rate you pay on booking Beware the hidden extras
The customer service if you have a problem is nonexistent there is no telephone contact only emails and they do not answer them
Foolishly I booked on a number of occasions with them always believing the next time would be a better experience  however it was always far worse Never again Pay a little extra  do not use this shockingly bad company You will be disappointed
They Quote rates which are designed to attract bookings when you arrive at the airport you will find out the real cost And then when you try to contact them you get no reply  no help and no service  they have had your money and do not want to know You have been warned
The sunglasses I ordered were discontinued but there was no mention of discontinued on the website I asked for express shipping and the items arrived the day I was leaving on the trip This experience was not a good one as expectations were not met
Flowers arrived 2 days late card missing Never use again Unable to contact them
I have sent multiple requests to Biblio to find out what has happened to my order They either reply with the same automated response with the same incorrect delivery dates or they dont respond at all I can only assume there has been a problem with the order but Biblio either cannot or will not help me Biblio will fail you completely if there is any sort of issue with your order Shop elsewhere
Prebooked a hire car from Goldcar rental through AutoEurope Paid an all inclusive price for the car including additional refundable excess insurance online before leaving the UK and arranged to pick up the car from Palma Mallorca Airport After queueing for over 90 minutes at the Goldcar desk but thats another story I handed over confirmation of booking to the Goldcar representative who then asked to swipe my credit card supposedly to cover any deficiency in fuel upon return of the car which I agreed to They hand you a PDA with a blank screen to sign and then superimpose your signature onto a digitally created agreement which they then put into a folder and hand to you I returned the car at the end of the hire period unmarked and with a full tank of fuel 4 weeks after my trip I received my credit card statement to find that Goldcar had deducted 23581 more than the actual cost of the car hire from my credit card for additional insurance which was neither discussed nor agreed to This is shocking and fraudulent behaviour and according to AutoEurope not an uncommon practice by Goldcar Following protracted correspondence with Goldcar Customer Services they maintain that Ive had the benefit of the insurance so will not reimburse me AutoEurope have purportedly investigated but quite frankly a complete waste of time
If you must use Goldcar for car hire QUESTION AND THOUROUGHLY CHECK WHAT YOU ARE SIGNING FOR BEFORE YOU WALK AWAY FROM THE DESK Goldcar have now had my money for 241 days
NOTE TO GOLDCAR  PLEASE DO NOT KEEP POSTING YOUR INANE COMMENTS I HAVE PREVIOUSLY CONTACTED YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICES DEPARTMENT WHO DID NOT PROVIDE A SATISFACTORY RESPONSE PLEASE JUST ANSWER THE FOLLOWING POINTS AS REQUESTED
1 GIVEN THAT YOU WERE AWARE THAT I HAD PURCHASED REFUNDABLE EXCESS INSURANCE AS PART OF MY DEAL WITH AUTOEUROPE WHY WERE THE TWO INSURANCE OPTIONS NOT MENTIONED AT THE TIME OF COLLECTING THE CAR YOU JUST DEBITED 23581 FROM MY CREDIT CARD WITHOUT EVEN ASKING OR DISCUSSING IT THIS IS EFFECTIVELY THEFT
2 WHY WOULD I LOGICALLY AGREE TO TAKE OUT THE OPTION OF YOUR SUPER RELAXED COVER WHEN I ALREADY HAD THE BENEFIT OF REFUNDABLE DEPOSIT COVER FROM AUTOEUROPE
You have my contact details should you wish to discuss however as I have previously stated I will keep posting this review until you refund my money in full
I never came the stethoscop I search the track and i went to the USPS local office They told me it was sent whitout andress to delivery I want my money back
I have been trying to ship an item from Adelaide to Yangon since December 2016 and have consistently received incomplete information delayed or no response to my very standard queries Today being told that I need to just keep trying to call the agents in Yangon whose phone numbers ring out and hope it works out
This is a just a quick summary of the service provided
 December 2015 advised by Pack and Send Pultney Street that they have experience shipping from Adelaide to Yangon and that it will take 32 days They advise their office will be closed over the New Year period and will reopen on 4 January 2017
 We go to Pack and Send Pultney Street on 4 January The office is not open even though we were told it would be so they have to go to Pack and Send Unley
 We are told by Pack and Send Unley that it may take a while to ship as the shipping companies are closed for most of January We are not told when the shipment will be sent what the process will be that it will go via Singapore or what the shipping Incoterms are
 We email Pack and Send Unley again on 8 January asking if they require any further documents No response it received
 We call Pack and Send Unley on 13 January to check they have received our email We are told that they have received our email and will send the Bill of Lading shortly
 We email Pack and Send Unley on 22 January asking for the Bill of Lading
 Pack and Send Unley send the Bill of Lading to the wrong email address on 31 January
 We email Pack and Send Unley on 31 January asking if they know the ETA and whether we need to contact the agent or if they will contact us when the shipment arrives
 We receive an email on 2 February saying that we should have an ETA in one week Our question regarding contacting the agent is not answered
 We email Pack and Send Unley on 13 February asking whether we have an ETA and again asking whether we need to contact the agent We do not receive a response
 We try to call the agent on 16 February using the numbers listed on the Bill of Lading None of their phone numbers work We look up their email on the internet Their email address bounces
 We email Pack and Send Unley on 16 February asking whether we have an ETA and asking whether we need to contact the agent as none of their phone numbers are being answered
 We receive a response on 20 February with the ETA and again not answering our question regarding the agent
 We are told that the phone numbers of the agent appear to be correct and to just keep trying and hope it works out
Thanks for nothing Pack  Send

They said they sent an email that said my contacts were on back order and there would be a delay but I never received such an email I have had no communication of the expected delivery date until I wrote this review If I was told it was going to be this long I would have cancelled my order It has now been 2 weeks and 3 days They said they expect my order to arrive tomorrow then they have to ship it to my house I expect it will be at least 3 weeks possibly more until I receive the contacts Sheesh
Delivery had missing items wrong item delivered
Our expensive rug was sent over a week later by post without any care

I ordered a set of luxury car mats  tailored for my car Received mats of the correct shape but didnt fit into the clips on my cars floor I contacted the company and over the course of 4 emails including pictures and a video they finally said do you want different fittings  so yes I agreed I do want different fittings Now Ive been driving around with them slipping around for nearly 2 weeks but today the different fittings arrived and to be fair they are different completely different from the fittings I need I have emailed asking for a full refund
So if youve just collected your new car and want luxury carpet mats specifically tailored to your car  give me a call as they may fit yours cos they dont fit mine
UPDATE  the reply posted below by car mats uk is actually quite funny human errors do occur yes one mistake is fair enough but when the mistake is pointed out you fix it you dont send another wrong set and then refuse to refund as Ive had the audacity to use the mats
Dont buy car mats from this company unless you like youre feet slipping about like Torvel and Dean as you try to brake
i send them 6 packages with total 60 shoes inside  i tell them to split to the small size boxes to reduce the costi tell them take out all the air bag and paper inside the box  and only left 5 pairs of shoes in each boxbut what they do is throw away my shoe boxes  only left the shoes and put a lots of air bags and paper inside the box to protect the naked shoes  without the shoe boxes  i cant sell the shoes  so i contact their customer service  they said i have to submit the silly support ticket and wait the claims department to reply me  because the claims department have no phone number no email address  i can only to submit the ticket to contact them and wait them reply me once a day  so finally i received their respond on next day  they said they can only compensate 50 USD for the shoeboxes  which my whole package is worth more then 8000 USD i do not agree and reply them they should compensate me at least 3500 USD and they just dont respond  after two days past  i contact them again  not they threat me that if i dont accpet the 50 USD  they will just closed the support ticket and would not reply me anymore Now i just want to find some people who had the similar issue and together we can sue them to the court

My elderly Dad had been using Frontiers services until a competing company called and enticed him to buy their services After Dad realized what had happened he tried to go back to Frontier because of the lower price and they were scheduled to come to his house yesterday but never showed up I his daughter called Frontier yesterday afternoon from Dads house and spoke to a Frontier customer service rep I relayed the scenario to her and she put me on hold and then came back and said she had spoken with a tech in our area who was close by and that he would be coming to the house within 10 minutes he wouldnt need to come inside but would only need to do something on the outside of the house She also told me to go ahead and switch the lines inside the home back to Frontiers modem right then As soon as I did that Dads phone service was lost and we waited and waited but no one ever showed up We tried calling Frontier many times and but no one answers and it is a waste of time hearing that the menu has changed etc over and over It would have been wonderful to get a real person on the line They simply will not answer our calls and now Dad has no service and cannot make calls Heads up people This is definitely not the kind of service youll want to be stuck with

Words can not express how disappointed I am with this service I paid to ship a package to Lusaka Zambia 121916 I was guaranteed the package would be delivered 12117 today is 2517 Customer Service reps dont return emails PLEASE SAVE YOU MONEY AND USE WELL KNOWN CARRIERS THAT WILL ASSURE YOUR PACKAGES ARRIVE TO THE PAID FOR DESTINATIONS I would give them a 0 rating Their International services are bad
Having the insuarnace as the default option is very bad I suspect if you review your calls you will find that the majority are to cancel this unwanted option
From ordering to receipt of books is inordinately long
I had to wait too long for my package to be deliver
Instead of 20 tulips only 16 arrived I am disappointed Where are the 4 parrottulips that I payed
I ordered a smart watch and it did not work I returned it and I was nice enough to go for the cheapest shipping option for the return my mistake because they said they will pay for the shipping  which they did  and I dont have a tracking  Now after 2 month they still say that they did not receive the watch Can I prove itNO So  my advise  dont be nice send the package back with the tracking  so they cannot tell you that they did not receive it Now I have no watch and no money 
Was surprised by how rude and begrudging the Redspot employee was Seemed like wed ruined his day by turning up to collect the hire car that had been booked several days earlier
Was very aggressive on insurance and additional payments Hostile tone for no apparent reason
Left the office after giving us a key so that we couldnt point out the car was scratched in multiple places before we collected it Wanted to point this out to demonstrate the condition of the car before we drove it
In a service based industry there should really be someone who isnt so rude and hostile towards consumers

Ive ordered twice in 2017 Firstly there was a huge delay in sending items Order dates and despatch days are weeks apart Great service of returns but foolishly I thought that would mean an exchange for the right size After reordering the item returned I got notice a few weeks after it wasnt in stock and due back in April 2017 Im in desperate need of a strapless bra which I ordered but that must have been removed due to lack of stock aswell as Ive just stopped breastfeeding and would like to wear strapless things to feel feminine but again Ive been disappointed by the stock counts I order online as it is the only way to get items and I feel very isolated and disappointed with Zodee standards of service and emails
Finally dont send Hello Fresh cards to people who cant use them There is not one WA delivery area so why just make it more upsetting for us western folks I cant even give it to my family members in Perth  I guess Ill have to reorder  wait for disappointment plus pay extra  not on sale  delivery  to get the strapless bra I need

Unfortunately I ordered 3 canon printer refills to take advantage of the lower individual cost about par with Kmart but when it came very promptly  I cant complain about the service it does not work I have tried everything had 2 other people check it for me The monitor says I have plenty of ink in there but it wont print Is it because it is not canon

My wife bought tickets to the James Taylor concert back in October 2016 The tickets were in the front rows A B or C and early prices were 20000 per seat That was paid The concert is scheduled for 14 February 2017 After many phone calls the tickets had not arrived by 13 February 2017 As we live on the North Coast and had to book accommodation by that time we had lost confidence and cancelled the accommodation we had tentatively booked Around 900 am on 14 February 2017 tickets for the extreme rear row arrived These tickets had been listed at 8900 each just days ago on the resale site
A phone call to Ticketmaster Resale achieved nothing other than confirmation that they are a total con
At this late stage there is little we can do except offer the tickets for resale  on guess whos site Where they get commission on the resale And we get to miss out on a concert which we booked premium seats for at the earliest possible opportunity
What more can I say  except to advise anybody contemplating dealing with these people to consider dealing with the devil himself in preference
Very bad form Ticketmaster Resale Shame Shame Shame
First lense I used got ripped from the first use I have no idea why Been using this for the past year with no issues but this time something not right

Paddy power  theft power
I should start by saying that I have held an account with Paddy Power for well over 10 years and in that time never really had any major issues
I am a casual punter and have placed the occasional bet mostly each week on the weekend football or during the CheltenhamRoyal Ascot
In terms of my success like most other punters I have lost more than I won but it was harmless and provided a little bit of entertainment
Recently a moth or so ago my luck changed and I had 3 or 4 bets which came in consecutively Now bearing in mind that previous to this I had been on a losing streak of about 20 bets then you wouldnt think this to be a problem Also the payouts themselves were relatively small the largest being a little over 200
However this didnt stop me from getting an email from Paddy Power stating
Thank you for your play with Paddy Power

The Conduct of their representative Chetan Kumar is rude and he just wanted to make a sale without understanding customer need When I wanted to talk to his supervisor he hung his phone on me I called in within 3 hours after booking my ticket in Travelopod but according only the agent who booked your Ticket could cancel it Secondly tried reaching the Supervisor but there was no one who caresSent an email but got no response and finally the agent gave me an offer for cancellation that I would just get 550 for a ticket of 930 and it has not been 24 hours I asked their other agent what is their cancellation policy He initially informed me that within 24 hours the complete amount is refunded and when I explained him about my concern he said that someone will get back to me and Im still waiting
My family and I bought 9 plane tickets for a flight in May 4 weeks ago I received an email informing me that KLM had cancelled the flight Bravofly send a suggestion for a new flight that was not acceptable We tried to arrange a rebooking but Bravofly was not able to arrange a new flight
The communiation with Bravofly has been my worst customer service experience ever Every time I spoke to them on the phone charging 1 DKR  minute I got a different reply Therefore I decided to contact them on email instead  that did not help Their response time was long and the replies not satisfactory
I decided to get a refund Bravofly would only refund about 78  of the ticket price I have in several emails explained them passengers rights according to EU regulation 2612004 They do not seem to care and are in violation of EU regulation
I am not finished with them yet but I feel obligated to share my story and hopefully others will refrain from any dealings with Bravofly
Ace service and ordering very good
Value for seat selections not worth it
Will not pay those Prices again 
Unfortunately the eyebrow mascara was nothing more than any common eyebrow shaper that you could find with 300 euros in a cosmetics shopIt starts to wash off after you wash your face one time so you need to repeat the procedure every day Just a waste of money

My frames came from Hong Kong even though the company name suggests its in USA I had to wait weeks for shipping which was awful because my son had broke his frames and NEEDED new ones very quickly I bought from this company because they were alot cheaper than the same frames at the eye doctor by I would have paid the higher price had I known shipping came from outside of the USA he could have had his replacement glasses weeks ago Thank goodness his prescription is fairly low so he can function somewhat without his glasses If that would have been for me though I would have been bed ridden for weeks since I cant see a thing without my glasses It would have cost me weeks off work I will not be recommending this company to anyone
I have bought numerous Electronic Cigarettes from this company They stopped working shortly after every single time I will never do business with this company ever again and I recommend that nobody purchases anything from this company
Every time I moved through items I would have to log in over and over again the ad to join would pop up consistently
One of my perks was suppose to be an outfit for 999
The site indicated any outfit over4999 I would be charged 999
I followed the link put sizes in but the order would not accept and the price was not as advertised

This business decided to close my account and steal all of my packages I dont really know what else to say They never even made an attempt at contacting me at any point in time just straight up stole my stuff AND fund balance
The flavours are great however the ingredients are not I had mince with bone and grizzle all through it to the point where i was scared of chipping me teeth on bone fragments Great flavour but unfortunately poor quality
Horrible return policy and dishonest disclosure I ordered 4 chairs with free shipping If I return them I not only have to arrange return shipping myself and pay for it and the restocking fee of 20 which I expected But they also plan to deduct the out bound free shipping from my refund This was not disclosed anywhere on the website which I know becauseI searched hard for return policy Outrageous fraud PLEASE PICK A MORE REPUTABLE COMPANY

Purchasing tickets for Ed Sheeran in Paris session timed out twice so I buy my tickets from elsewhere 4hrs later I get charged for the tickets No contact details to contact Ticketbis to gain a refund Really bad Im currently sat 270 out of pocket not knowing whether I have any chance of getting my money back
Very bad connection Takes too long to connect The other person keeps hearing their own voice and the voice is distorting
You are better of taking a normal taxi and its almost always cheaper to take a taxi and you can find one right away whichever airport you are at
my flight was delayed and they could not get me a ziptransfer they actually recommended me using a normal taxi when I called them international call while roaming
the normal taxi ended up cheaper
requested a refund from ziptransfers and referred me to their TC that I shouldve notified them 48 hours ahead of my flight delayhow can I know my last flight in 3 connection flight will be delayed 48 hours ahead go figure
very bad customer service and unreliable services
I had cancelled my booking and bravofly promised me a refund of 21215 EUR  I live in India and the exchange rate is 1 EUR  7059 Indian Rupees INR  According to this calculation I should have got a refund of 1497354 But when I checked my bank statement I received just INR 26177  371 EUR  What about the rest of my money It amounts to INR 1496983 This is a huge amount of money Please return it

QUERO UM NOVO BOLETO DO PAGAMENTO
Reserved a unit a week ahead Manager called several times during the weeks letting me know that status and availability of the unit Told the manager that I would be in Friday afternoon and arrived at 400 No one there called number and rang until VM picked up I came back Saturday morning at 1000 ready to rent unit pay 2nd month and rent truck Was told no units available Manager not there I ask if they rented this morning and they said no Asked for smaller unit and they said same price as larger Asked if the truck was reserved for us and they said no This person just didnt want to help I asked for the manager and they said no one until Monday
Went online after and there were 2 units available and reserved them Its been over the limit for me to receive a call and nothing as of yet Im in the customer service world and I am just confused how someone could be that absent minded not to show any care or concern I dont believe that this person was trained in taking care of a customer or making a sale
I had heard of excessive cdw insurance so I organised third party insurance to cover this however they proceeded to tell me that 1k euros would be taken off my credit card and may take 6 days to refund after I had dropped off the vehicle So I had no choice but to buy this insurance Aggressive tactics and made the whole cost of insurance over twice as much as I originally planned for This entire practice should be regulated and excess should be set to a reasonable amount
I order
I pay
I asked for nothing special just to deliver the flowers to the recipient address
Two days after due date nothing happened
I send a message to Euroflorist
They investigated and answered very quickly
They apologize the florist said that he was sick on that day Valentine day haha and that he could not proceed with the delivery
They promised to pay me back within a few days
In fact they already did today three hours after
So I think that Euroflorist looks very responsive and very professional but that the florists they appointed are not good enough for them If the guy was sick and couldnt deliver he could at least call the recipient call me or call Euroflorist to inform us or to appoint another one
At the moment the recipient does not know that I tried to send him some flowers
I will remember this Valentine day
So next time I will order from the web florist that I used before 
It was fast and simple I was happy with that part We had agreed on the phone to a far lesser daily  and are charged almost 10 more
Waiting for notification that the Roku is waiting my collection in Nutgrove
I have had multiple problems with PostNL and zero help from their customer service with regards to it Basically something happened to 70 of my large packages delivered by PostNL
Example one I ordered online fragile dinnerware and paid EXTRA for evening delivery to make sure I am at home so that my package wouldnt go around for too long for another delivery attempt and something brakes But the order arrived during the day when I was not at home despite the fact it was supposed to arrive after 6pm Then they were driving it around for another 3 days before it arrived to the closest post office from where I had to carry it myself a very heavy package And everything was broken inside by that time Customer service told me I cannot even file a complaint because I AM NOT THEIR CLIENT but the online store is and they are the only ones who can complain
Example two I ordered something from another online shop which was supposed to be delivered until 4pm on a Saturday I didnt receive anything and was surprised to discover my delivery status in Track  Trace as delivered Called customer service and they just said it might be a mistake and I must wait until 6pm or if it doesnt come another 5 working days support specialist said it as if it is something normal and I am the crazy one here to complain But of course the 6pm deadline was arbitrary since this is when the support closes and I cannot call back anymore for another day and a half I didnt receive anything even a note that it might have been delivered to my neighbours TT just says I got the package This is unacceptable
Online stores should all stop using PostNL and some dont anymore indeed because I got deliveries from various companies and literally anyone is better than PostNL with their unprofessionalism and indifference
Cherry on top A few weeks ago I saw a PostNL employee pissing at our buildings back door which is extensively used  at the street where many people walk in Amsterdam I guess this is the only thing they are good at
I am usually impressed with US companies but shipito is the first worse ever experience for me as a international customer
They take forever to get back to you Support Tickets What a joke
I want to close my account completely as i no longer need it not just have it sit there in dormant status Facebook only hold onto accounts numbers to add value to their business Please close peoples account when people say closed it should mean deleted for good
This is the first time I do this type of reviews but I had such a bad experience that I think I should share it  its NOT A GOOD SERVICE AT ALL My first experience on the website was good so I felt confortable to do a second order I bought a mobile phone on the website and I paid for the International Express Delivery  24 to 48 hours Guess what The delivery took more than a week Besides that I noticed that I payed almost more 3 euros for the postage that the site announces I contacted the Customer Service and they told me they could refund me of the difference but then forgot it and didnt say anything about the fact that I payed for a Express Delivery and it has been a week and nothing I contact them again and I receive an answer with an atitude oh well its normal I paid extra for a service I dont received what they promise and this is the kind of reply NEVER AGAIN thanks
4 MONTHS BEFORE THE GAME
 I payed 2 tickets BVB Borussia Dortmund  RB Leipzig game for West Stand 28348 on 06102016 which cost me 300 with transaction fees
7 DAYS BEFORE THE GAME
 Ticketbis agent called me from Spain to inform me that they DONT HAVE tickets I payed 4 months ago and they offered me nice tickets to the East Stand  I said okay
ON THE GAME DAY
 I got 2 tickets for North East Stand  which cost 8980 4490 each which were by the way tickets for the OPPOSITE team so we set among RB Leipzig fans Youre lucky we didnt got hurt because I would sue you
SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THE GAME
 After I got back to Serbia I wrote them an email with pictures of the receipt and tickets as proofs that mistake happened and that I want difference in what I payed for and what I got total of 19368 back
I got an answer from their support agent that I can only get 15 of that amount back
DISGRACE
Message to the chat bot
Yes I understand how your system works Yes I know you connect sellers and buyers but you sent me WRONG and CHEAPER tickets I payed for West Stand 300 4 months before the game I got North East Stand of 90 I am handing over this to my attorney
I have send them 5 emails about a purchase I have made But no answer what so ever  It was only about 5 EUR but it is money to  So really bad customer service they have a lot to learn about that 
Dont waist your time or money spent 3000 for this certificate that claims to help reduce your insurance cost and my insurance company will not even accept the certificate I attempted to get a refund back from the company without success or comment Very disappointed
I believe that every small business during the growing stages will have the need of a loan or secure an investor to grow I found my self needing a loan to open another location and during my search I applied on lending tree I was inmidiately contacted by a few companies claiming they can help me get the best deal After doing my research on places such as trust pilot I ended up going with Lendio to help me My rep was calling emailing and texting to the point where I felt comfortable sending 1years worth of my companies financial statements on top of all my personal information he seemed caring enough and honest in to wanting to help So here is the issue I read the good reviews and bad reviews but somehow I convince my self i was not going to have issues because he was so on top of my case before I gave him the info After a week I sent an email and received a very short answer we submitted paperwork to our lenders we should hear from them very soon After two weeks I decided to email again and I swear the email he sends is a generic reply because it was exactly like the first one so I call the office and I was told this was not normal two weeks without an answer and that I was going to receive a call from a manager I check all bad reviews and guess what all bad reviews are the same exact situation If you feel like chancing your entire financial records bank statements federal tax id number and social security number to someone who might call you might not go ahead and use Lendio Its been 3 weeks and I still havent heard from the manager who was supposed to check on this or the rep who took my case
I bought an egift certificate the day before Valentines day Although the money was taken from my account I never received the product I wrote twicefinally hearing that I need an order number a number I never received because I never got an email confirming the purchase
I have a football match I should be attending but tickets still aint turned up Paid nearly 1000 pound for them Its a joke
I ordered football boots for my son when I went to collect them I was given wrong package and I didnt realise it until I got home I know it was a human error but it was a disaster having to go back and change them for my package
give credit to your good customers
I am giving a bad review as we are constantly having issues with your system Messages arent going out we have even tried tests  some of them where received and some werent or they are going out on a different day altogether We have had clients that have received their SMS in random symbols I will just log on and get timed out straight away Every time I call you to see if there are any issues with your system yous cant help or say I cant see anything wrong
Definitely an unacceptable experience
So I signed up after thinking of a change from my current provider and I cannot get anymore that 2Mbps  support where straight up rude and wouldnt offer much help I have tried for the last 2 days to get a refund with no reply
Stay well away and stick with the reputable VPN companies
Wanted to take advantage of the 2 for 24 leggings special but there were no colors or sizes available to choose from Very disappointed
I placed an order in November and in January reached out to customer service for help I was told I would have to wait until January 30 to resolve the matter After still not receiving my order I reached out again At this point I request a refund I was told I was only due a partial refund because I didnt purchase insurance which I dont recall being asked to do Not only did not not have my gift for my niece for Christmas but only a partial refund is unexceptionable
Very disappointed
I have to say I was very disappointed to say that flowers I sent for Christmas never got delivered my sister in law had to go and collect them on the 29th Dec half the flowers had died I had to ring twice from Canada and was told I would get an email to let me know what happened I never got this email I then had to ring my sister in law to see if she had received the flowers
I will never use this florist again
Im not to happy with the labels within a month n a half I through them all only thing that was good was the dog chain keychain extremely disappointed and upset I payed a lot of money for these and they didnt stick nor stay as long as they should have must have been a very bad Bach or something I do like what u do but not happy with what I got 
No English speakers You write an email in English and you receive the answer in German language even though initial email was understood the worst customer service ever Do not shop here if you want to save your nerves otherwise good luck to everyone
book never arrived BookHouseGlobal did not respond multiple inquiries Dont buy from BookHouseGlobal
I would not use Goldcar again The staff were incredibly rude and verged on aggressive when trying to get me to pay for added cover As a female travelling alone I felt threatened and forced into paying extra in order to set off before it got dark The member of staff was talking about me in Greek and then lied repeatedly telling me made up figures about damage to cars and false facts about the policy i had already purchased Avoid this company
I have spoken to the customer service team there and they only say that the staff member was doing his job in ensuring I was aware of the dangers of driving The fact that I was made to feel so uncomfortable that I had to repeatedly ask him to stop speaking to me in such a forceful way has not been apologised for in any way
Completely worthless company to book through They will not help at all with any issues they simply play a game of he said she said blaming the hostel and not taking any responsibility and definitely not being of any help However they are quick and happy to take your money and not give it back when it is definitely not the customers mistake and it is absolutely their mistake Save yourself the trouble and book directly through the hostel  only use Hostelworld for searching Im reporting the charge with my credit card as fraudulent
Fabletics has so much to offer
Almost everything I wear at the gym is Fabletics
I get lots of compliments and I always say its from Fabletics 
This site is full of cowboys You cant offer more than 2000 on a job which is ridiculous when someone wants a 3 bed house painted Cowboys are bidding stupidly low prices to get the jobs and ruining it for us professionals They have no knowledge I know this as they bid without asking any basic questions and when the job has no description or pictures Waste of time And airtasker charging 15 of the job is just a joke
starts out nice but the lid leaves a lot to be desired the seal is very hard to clean the large opening is nice but allows your drink to splash out and with no way to close it if it falls over is going to spill I do not recommend this to be used on the go might be ok if just sitting at home our work
they did not honor my coupon code for 5 when asked they would not send me the 5 and said they would apply it to my next order
I order phone case in 1st of February after waiting for almost a month I got a wrong item when my order was confirm they even send me the item that I order with the picture I was so glad to see that and waiting all this time to get the item that order but at last I got the wrong cheaper item They send me the cheaper item which I didnt like it and which I didnt even order it This is very unfair and annoying I didnt pay money my sweat to be cheated
I use skype often for workpersonal use and it is a great service Also was an investor in Microsoft
Occasionally I use it to calltext mobile numbers but not every 180 days and here lies the problem The credit expires Isnt that nice for your balance sheet and horrible for the customer I have to go through an activation hoop if I have timenotice that my 322 cents is expiring within another 180 days
You are burdening happy customers with mindless games to save transfer balances from customers to your balance sheet How about entrusting your product team to create features that people will happily pay for instead of features that financesenior management want to show shareholders quick wins
Devesting in Microsoft Wrong approach 
I order
I pay
I asked for nothing special just to deliver the flowers to the recipient address
Two days after due date nothing happened
I send a message to Euroflorist
They investigated and answered very quickly
They apologize the florist said that he was sick on that day Valentine day haha and that he could not proceed with the delivery
They promised to pay me back within a few days
In fact they already did today three hours after
So I think that Euroflorist looks very responsive and very professional but that the florists they appointed are not good enough for them If the guy was sick and couldnt deliver he could at least call the recipient call me or call Euroflorist to inform us or to appoint another one
At the moment the recipient does not know that I tried to send him some flowers
I will remember this Valentine day
So next time I will order from the web florist that I used before

I placed an order for an item that was listed as in stock and would be delivered within 35 working days I paid via Paypal 2 weeks later I had still not received the item I had sent several messages via the website without any acknowledgement or response so raised a dispute in Paypal I was told that the item could take up to 3 weeks to be delivered as it was coming from Germany to the UK incorrect details therefore published on the website I asked for my order to be cancelled and the amount to be refunded I agreed to return the item when  if it arrived The item did eventually arrive and was immediately repackaged and returned recorded delivery the next day It has now been nearly 1month since my original contact with this company and my refund has still not been processed I have sent another message via the website that I am now waiting on a reply from If you want quick and efficient service do not order from this company I have been extremely disappointed
When I booked my trip the front page had a 100 off coupon  As we continued through the process it never gave a place to enter the code I called customer service 30 seconds after I booked it and was told first that I missed it and they cant go back and credit it After explaining there was no place she said she could see it when she looked After explaining again it wasnt there she put me on hold for a long time hoping I would hang up I am sure At that point she came back on and said that code had expired at some point I explained even at that point it was still listed on the web page and she said there was nothing she could do about it I have used Bookit before without issue so I am very unhappy with this customer service and will look else where next time

I rented a car with Flizzr in Geneva to go skiing for the weekend Car was fine and everything went smoothly untill I got home and saw my cc bill Flizzr charged me sfr 122 for fuel I mailed and asked for some billreceipt and an explanation for the charge They send me a receipt from the gas station of sfr 50 plus a bill from them for sfr 122 So sfr 72 eur70 to fill up a tank of gas I complained about the height of the amount I fully understand i have to pay but this is ridiculous and doesnt compare with other car rental agencies Sixt  who operate Flizzr in Geneva just charge you a full tank In response Flizzr credited my account fot sfr 10 Leaving a charge of sfr 112 seems like an extra businees model Wouldnt recommend them to anyone
They arrived quickly but are not the colour I ordered I clicked on rose got sent bronze Apart from that everything was OK
Hello everyone i am here to share my experience with Bravofly and i am sorry to say it is the worst experience i have had with any travel agency
I booked my flight to Brazil for the 15 of November 2016 it was a 3 month stay with return the 7 of February the day after i ordered my travel Bravofly wrote me that the internal flight in Brazil was cancelled and i had the choice to choose 1 option that they gave me when i said yes to this they informed me that there had been an error and the flight they offered me wasnt available the next option they gave me was around 10 hours longer than the one i originally ordered but i needed to be in Brazil as soon as possible so i had no choice to accept i then saw that my middle name was written wrong my name is Raunskov and ticket said Ruanskov and asked them if it was possible to change this they told me they would try to contact all the airlines involved after maybe 5 minutes i got an answer that 1 or more flight company that was involved in my trip had a policy where they didnt change names and my only option to be able to make sure i would be able to get on then flight would be to cancel my trip and order it again but i would only receive 887 Euros of the around 1200 i paid in the first place as i am a student i did not have money to change this because this was literally all the money i had and i needed to go see my girlfriend about personal matters i personally called all the flight companies KLM Air France GOL LATAM and they insured me that they all could change it and we lived in 2016 and this was only a small change in the system but it had to be made with my travel agency but when i called Bravofly they put the responsibility on Air France because they were my ticket holders after several phone calls to Air France and Bravofly Air France explained to me how to tell Bravofly what to do to change my name and i had to walk BravoFly through it i asked to talk to a manager but i got the answer i couldnt because the people i talked with was only a call center so they outsource the support and have no managers there to help with the support the support was very nice but they didnt know anything about my problem or how to help me after almost 2 weeks where i spend from 12 to 17 everyday on the phone calling different companies in different countries and used a lot of my own money i succeeded when i arrived at the airport where they said my flight was cancelled in Brazil i found out that the flight wasnt cancelled and they gave me no notice about this so i then again had to call around to make sure i made it to the right plane and funny enough it was the plane i ordered in the first place that wasnt cancelled
Then came my time to go home and surprise this flight got cancelled as well but now i am home again and wanted to inform all of you what i have been through with this company
At one point i was considering to drive to Switzerland where i think the group that owns bravofly has headquarters just to talk with somebody that could help me
so i just want to say you should really think if you are willing to maybe use several days and a lot of your own money to call several countries and companies to save a couple of euros
Kindest regards Frederik
I did not get the order do not reply to messages
Ordered a server from them and it didnt work from the start due to their overcrowding issues Contacted support and still havent gotten a response three days later However they seem to be quick with the responses to tickets that involve them losing money Was denied a refund even though the service didnt work from day one so I opened up a paypal dispute due to them delivering a nonfunctional service and trying to hide behind their ridiculous policies Do not buy from this host you will just be wasting your money
order placed on january 6th no news on january 26th no answer to my questions
I have not received a dime or any notification why I shouldnt be paid
We had ordered several different kind of bushes from the company Our blueberry bushes didnt come with the rest of the order and the company had me take pictures of my rows to prove I was telling the truth The raspberry bushes they did send were dead and they told us to ship them back They also said they couldnt ship us good ones til the fall cause it was too late We did finally get the good bushes in the fall but with so many issues with our order it is doubtful that we will be ordering from this company again
order became unavailable after processing and nobody could explain why or even returned my emails for explanation nor offered to replace back order or offer substitutions
I booked the wrong date online and tried to make changes The cost would have been 290 to make alterations or 125 to cancel and obtain credit I cancelled and had to call back in to leverage the credits Mentioned this was what I was looking to do and was transferred 3 times When I booked the flight I was charged they never leveraged the credits noting that I did not ask to use credits on the call even though I was pushed to three different departments to help me with this I just paid twice for a trip and they have no resolution owners in place and theres no direction I feel like they purposely were vague to steal my money Crooks I am still fighting to resolve this issue but theyre giving me no options and no customer support
Booked and paid for accommodation in Juli 2016 for our holiday in January 2017 was informed it was cancelled in Juli 2016 no one informed us company is in receivership The bankrupt
Horrible experience Booked a flight through flight hub they contact me later that evening saying it was cancelled because of credit card issue No problem rebooked again for the flight next morning Early next morning get another email saying flight was cancelled once again due to airfare changes after I already booked flight for set price They contact saying they want more money What a joke this website is had no other option at the time had to get to my destination so agreed to pay the extra when we were rebooking once again they then say the flight is unavailable all together Had to book a later flight that day booked right through West Jet and was taken care of right away Because of my experience though and later flight I was help up in Toronto for 2 days because of weather I know fellow colleagues who were on the morning flight who made it to the destination on time Because of flighthub I missed my opportunity to get on that flight all due to horrible organization and poor service Garbage service will never use again Recommend to nobody I will be letting people know about my experience with this company
Books are shipped in a plastic envelope without any padding Its just a plastic bag really And they put in as many as will fit  Ive received as many as 6 in one plastic bag
This means that books WILL get damaged in the mail  dings to corners and edges at the least All my packages showed evidence of scraping and in some cases had tiny holes from the scrapes One book I got had a dent to the spine with a corresponding hole in the bag
Im never buying from Thriftbooks again
I have been using online travel agencies for several years and many times every year but its the first time I have an issue like this
I bought the flight on Bravolfy for 640 euros and they immediately charged me for the whole amount After a few hours they contact me asking 91 euros more cause the price of the flight increased
They asked me if I accept to give them the surcharge and I said NO
I am still waiting for the reimbursement cause til now they kept my money
Same old same oldno real difference

Order 170203146016688052 canceled After bidding a product marked clearing with a clear discount my order was canceled by offering a small discount on another product indicated This type of operations should be controlled and prosecuted as it entails extortion to the consumer a waste of time and money You also open a ticket and do not answer disastrous I will never buy again in this type of store Added to my blacklist

Once I had filled in all my personal traveler and payment information my original Quote of 2686 was on the top of the screen and the button at the button said something like agree and submit to book So I pressed it and got charged 2755 That price was NOT what I agreed to I understand the fairs go up moment to moment but why was my agreed price not corrected by Flighthub before they charged me I feel they owe me 69 Bad business

I used Trivago and selected Amoma for a two day stay in Manchester
Because I was called to hospital I had to cancel the second day and was charged 40 for doing so
Then they cancelled the the first day instead of the second but then when I pointed this out sent me a voucher with a reference number which I printed off and took to the hotel where it was rejected
After my insistence on the hotel checking the booking that had been cancelled they found the original booking and the erroneous rebook both of which had been cancelled but those bookings had code numbers different from the ones on my current voucher and were not made directly by amoma
After 90 minutes the manager was still insisting that I had no reservation and I could only stay at his hotel by paying the rack rate by credit card and complaining to amoma
It was not a pleasant experience
Eventually in order to get to the theatre on time I offered my card I was then told that the booking had been traced and the unnamed source acting on my behalf via Amoma had admitted liability and would confirm the booking
I complained to the hotel management and was told that an investigation had been put in place  over a week later I have heard nothing more
Amomas website does not acknowledge the words complain complaint or how to complain
Advice
Never use Amoma
Be careful about the companies that offer deals on Trivago etc
If you are sent a reservation to print off make sure it has details of the organisation offering it and if it doesnt print off the email as well to identify the source
Check the price on the direct booking website of the hotel and Quote the deal you have found and ask them to match it  or confirm the booking with the hotel when you receive the voucher
DONT WHATEVER YOU DO USE AMOMA
I Ordered early December for 8 items it is mid February and nothing has arrived yetnot pleased that their tracking which I paid extra for stops once it leaves the originating country then when I contact them they offer a refund I say great that would be goodand then nothing happens I get in contact with them again and they give me a song and dance story then I dont hear from again for a few days until I make a public complaint on their Facebook page and the whole song and dance starts again
I bought a laser engraving machine that does not associate with any of my computers Ive sent a Main and they do not listen to me

A Jamie Wiley called me last week to offer to review my medigap plans I dutifully checked her out to be sure she was not a telephone fraudster After I was satisfied that Jamie wasIs legitimate I discussed my medigap information with her and she forwarded Quote s to me She then called me in follow up and I had decided to not change my plans She accepted that She was polite and very nice to work with and told me to call back if I had further questions
So I get another question and try to make contact with Jamie only to be told she is no longer with this department Now I am suppose to talk with someone else This all sounds very fishy and as a result I no longer trust GoMedigap
Now I am not saying Jamie Wiley is or was or whatever dishonest She sounded very legitimate and knowledgable But how can I trust GoMedigap when I am passed off from sales person to sales person

Ive been trying to cancel my subscription for days Literally calling constantly during business hours and theres been no answer Ever Ive emailed and Ive gotten the same message of they have to speak to me first but they wont pick up the flipping phone Worst of all they make you pay upfront then dont even give you great options for candy they only give a tiny bit to pick from which they conveniently cant do anything about Never again Ever
The information that was presented I found very valuable However the videos were way too short and I found myself clicking the next button within 1 min of the video starting because it was already over
There are grammatical errors within the presentation
Some of the quiz questions were not in the videos prior to the quiz
The most important info that was covered in the section was not on the quiz instead silly no brain questions were in their place
Some of the quiz questions were not worded correctly and did not leave an absolute 100 definite answer
The course did not force the student to learn the more important items but instead reiterated the obvious
I truly believe that i could have received close to the required 80 without any of the prior course work because the final exam did not cover very much other than common sense This course took an extreme amount of time for not much reward I took it very seriously just to get to the final exam and finish it in 10 minutes I received a 95 and i bet the questions i missed were the questions that did not have a definite answer I think this course needs to be reviewed and some things changed so that the student actually retains the most important info LASTLY charging 30 for me to learn very little isnt fair I took this course to learn and become educated not use my common sense I already have that and it was FREE
Have not received my wig yet
Well its been a couple of weeks and I am still in processing However the price has gone up 23 Luck me
RS electrical got address wrong which subsequently delayed delivery Not very impressed
They told us only one room was available on our preferred dates but that was wrong it was HotelsOne that only had one on their list not the hotel itself Our full payment on booking was nonrefundable  doubtful legality I phoned before going requesting sheets and blankets not duvet but was told that regretfully they couldnt deal with this but would forward our request But they didnt Finally the extra surcharge made by HotelsOne was in no way worth paying
We are travelling Brussels to Paderborn and are not familiar with Brussels transportation infrastructure The tickets indicate clearly method of travel from BruxellesMidi to Paderborn HOWEVER the part from Bruxelles Central to Bruxelles Midi is not explained nor does it show on the tickets Is this by subway another train or some other means How is it ticketed It does not show on the tickets but does show on the booking I guess we will have to research on site
Very confusing
Was trying to order 2 extraits for my mom as a birthday present took 5 tries and at the end only got one was still charged for expedited shipping due to the delays on Diors end and didnt get any of the promised samples Called multiple times did not get any call backs from the voicemails I left Very disappoint and frustrated by this experience
Oppdo shows flight prices that exclude their fee The fee appears only at the last minute before payment making you waste time before you realize that the prices of their competitor for the same flights were in fact  cheaper
They also charged the incorrect amount to my Credit card The price shown before payment A the price shown after payment B and what was actually charged on my card C were all different
NEVER AGAIN
Read the return policy before ordering Will only allow 1 exchange or return but returns are subject to 20 restocking fee Will never order from them again Found same frames for same price without any limitations on exchange or return on another site

Flowers were not delivered
Poor quality clothing marked up on the tags and then heavily discounted Makes the buyer feel like they are getting a special discount from a big name brand when really you are only getting what you paid for
No reminder about reading meters and find energiea v expensive will leave to new supplier once contact up Not happy with it at all
I was trying to find a new freight forwarding company so I decided to give Shipito a go I used their calculatorshipitocom to simulate a package delivery to where I live It worked perfectly  the page gave me a lot of options and prices for delivery So I went ahead and bought something and had it delivered to shipito When I tried to forward the package my country wasnt there So I tried to forward it to another freight forwarding service and it turns out they specifically blacklisted their postal code even though the calculator says they can deliver there
I used their support chat several times and in every occasion they would disappear for 10 minutes without any reply and in the end they couldnt help me at all always escalating the issue to someone else At the end I just gave up and sent it to a friend in the US
I am not someone who gives free advertising but in this case I think Im doing everyone a favor go with myus and youll be better off Might not be perfect but for sure way better than shipito
I placed my 1st order with Shodazzle to make Christmas purchases for myself My mother Paulette WhitneyMcClain recommended me to you because shes been with you for years My package arrived at my Christmas destination in Vegas When the 1st of 3017 rolled around because I had just mad a purchase I opted to skip the month However I was still charged the 3995 When I received that email I immediately called and asked for a refund My refund was granted BUT SHOEDAZZLE turned right back around and charged me AGAIN for the 3995for the 3bd time in January I was told I would be getting a refund for the 3nd time However Im still waiting and Customer Service keeps telling me that I have bee refunded and I cant get back into my account because it was closed I will be asking them to reopen because my boots that I ordered are too small and I need to exchange them per my VIP status that I had and then hopefully I can see the messed up transactions in my account so I can prove that they still owe my my 2nd 3995 they deducted and is shirt in my checking account with my bank
Thank you
Ebone Whitney
Company had not responded back to me in several days I require sometime of response and they did not deliver I wanted to get cash for gold but after several ID rejection attempts goldmoney still has not helped with my refund or ID uploading I will seek legal action against them Do not do it
Im very disappointed in your website As a new member I put in the promo code to get the 20 discount on membership  it stated I would pay 7900 and the site would then not let me confirm the membership or order So I went back in and had to pay the full 99 before it would confirm my membership Now I tried to download forms I ordered but I did not get the download and you have charged my credit card Very disappointing You also need to have a weekend call in service

I have to warn anyone who want to buy anything from Mighty Ape based on my sad experience
It was first time i purchase an UE Boom 2 speaker from Mighty Ape for my friend birthdays present on 28th Dec 2016 Then my friend found the faulty of the battery so i cantacted MAone of the customer servicr staff Savannah was friendly and helpful on arrange a return to MA
But then Savannah was missing and no reply from her anymore since her last email on 19th Jan 2017 In between i had send 5 meesage to her but no reply at all
10 days after i sent out my parcel on 2 feb 2017 im still received nothing from MA I was starting worry on it  so I contacted Live chat provided by MA they told me they have received my item a week ago They were in the process of testing I was so kind and understanding to them and what i can do was only waiting
Whats coming the next is more interesting On 8th Feb i still have nothing with me so i was contact with MA again i lost my patient on it anymore I told them i have been send it out since 3 weeks ago they never informing me and updating my anything about my UE Boom so i need to know what going on  I was told that they have to spend 2448 hours to reply customer email but the problem was i have been waiting for more than that And they were going to check with technical department
After thati received an email from technical department said that they will send out the on the same day I have no idea what going on if i didnt contact MA I assumed that they forgot about me
Few days later i received my replacement But there was another problem the original UE Boom 2 i returned was with well presentation hard plastic case But replacement UE BOOM 2 was come with all paper cardboard material case and packaging As it was a Birthday present the replecements appreance was really low class when compare to the first one And I have never been told about this before that
 picture provide if requested
Im feeling like been fooling around againTherefore i contacted Ma about that again then they replied and asked for picture proof
In between i found another problem with the bluetooth of the speaker it tooks more than 10 minutes to get connect to any device no matter iphone samsung or ho laptop I have to keep reopen my device and speaker bluetooth to get it connected So i reported to them as well
At the first they were telling me that the paper casing is newer packaging and not their problem and they cant do anything on it Then i replied its fine  if i has been told but its not
From the offline email they were replying I can feel that they were trying to ignore me and starting unfriendly to me So they were telling me if i believe the item is faulty so need to return it back
I was fine to returnted it back but the problem was i have no idea how long again it have to wait for 
I have lost patient to them anymore They let me feel like im annoying them No one would spend more than Nearly a month to a same thing 
So i decided to go for Live chat for my question and i would like request Refund instead of infinity waiting if they couldnt offer me the same case
Then the friendly customer service representative Ruth was telling me that they cant do the refund and her colleague was sent me the email cleary about returned them an item to check she will send me again if I dont understand on it
I was more angry about her attitute and the way she act like i would like to know the exactly date taken based on long wait last time Then she keep replied with copy common sentences like
have you sent the 2nd unit back to us doesnt look like we have received yet
have you sent the 2nd unit back to us doesnt look like we have received yet  We are unable to refund uintil we or our supplier have confirmed product is faulty Im afraid
So i was really angry about that so i was telling her not just telling the thing i know and think from your side please do think from customer view as well
I need to know how long it takes for this 
After lots of repeated sentences she END UP our conversation and quit the chat without informing me
Im was shock How come a customer could do like this to customer  Its horrible and terrieble customer service i Ever had  The most irrespect from the customer service representative
Mighty Ape has big word from their website saying biggest No 1 online store in NZ friendly customer service provided accept and feedback
But i have received nothing from MA about the feedback i placed from 31th Jan 2017
And thay cant even provide me any contact number i could call
One and half months pass since i bought this item from Mightly Ape
Im still waiting for anyone from Might Ape to telling me whats going on with all my experienced
But i can say it is the worst online shopping experience i ever had
 i have read few review from other website that Might Ape had problem with product and service provide to customer 
It was my first and my last time on it 
I travel often business and personal  nationally and internationally I take time to review properties infrequently and rarely contribute a negative review I suppose Ive become accustomed to problems and glitches that contribute to a less than perfect stay and tend to be understanding As a result my few reviews almost always acknowledge exceptional service or a very positive experience However in this case I honestly feel the public would be at risk if I dont share  Ive never had a worse experience with a property and its management than this I wont elaborate on the minor issues and instead document the most egregious When toilets were flushed in the upstairs bathroom  raw sewage percolated up and into the downstairs tub Imagine human excrement in the tub you as you were about to use or previously had used without knowledge this had occurred I personally called customer service 9 times many more calls from my friends and family submitted a Maintenance request via the Vacation Rental Pros property management app and never received any response On one of the later calls I learned the customer service person I was speaking with was in the Philippines Of course every time I called I spoke with someone different and had to explain the issue over and over ad nauseam and always receiving promises of call backs and service to repair  neither of which ever occurred We abandoned the downstairs completely and crammed all our guests in the upstairs for the duration of this short stay I would advise everyone to avoid this property management company Although I thought I was reserving this property with VRBO i actually paid Vacation Rental Pros I dont know who is primarily responsible for managing problems with the property but I will never knowingly do business with Vacation Rental Pros Ive filed a dispute with my credit card company  perhaps they can reach someone at Vacation Rental Pros that care I hoping if they dont get paid I may actually hear from someone
For all intents and purposes cannot return these products since they come from Europe Ive tried to return a helmet they sent at the wrong size The package was sent and months later came back as not accepted by recipient Clearly this is not a hassle free return policy as they state
I recently purchased a 650i from Stratstone Derby and when collecting all seemed fine On the 200 mile drive home numerous faults were identified including a broken door lock smelly air con and blown speakers
I immediately reported this and it was agreed that I could take the car into my local dealer in Colchester They ordered the relevant parts and the vehicle was booked in
On the day work started the dealership phoned to say there were serious problems with the vehicle and the amplifier was underwater and there was a large amount of water in the rear of the vehicle causing various degrees of corrosion
I immediately informed Stratstone and rejected the vehicle I was then informed it was my responsibility to return the vehicle 200 miles away I asked how I would be able to get home after this and was told they would give me a lift to Derby train station What a joke I then had to pay for the car to be transported back to Derby
I requested that this money be refunded but was told no
I then contacted the pathetic BMW customer services team Sarah who having heard my story took ten mins to decide that they wouldnt help and couldnt do anything about the situation
BMW proudly advertise they carry out exhaustive checks on their vehicles in my case it is obvious that did not occur and the dealership does not have the decency to to pay for the vehicles return or explain how the vehicle was supplied in such a bad state
My next move will be a solicitor as I will not let this drop
BMW have now lost another customer although with their profits they wont give a damn
dont treat with this company
It was great for a while now I cant connect to the number I called the most It sucks
Googling for tickets led me direct to this site As nothing could be found on the main Ticketmaster site I assumed that they were sold out and this was the only way left to obtain such After purchasing at apparently about double the original price I realised that the tickets were originally sold through Ticketek and that there were plenty still available there I wont get caught a second time but this scalping to the unwitting even if it only happens once to each should not be happening
Had to wait for two hours to get our car Missed a meeting No upgrade nothing
Poor man behind the counter could not help it but the processing was appalling whereas I had already done all the admin from home apparantly typing skills have to be put to the test and all has to be redone on UK soil
Never again rentalcarscom
Extremely disappointed that I paid for faster shipping and my order didnt even ship for 3 days after the order date The higher shipping cost was a waste of my money I contacted your company and was just told sorry that is how it works sometimes I just decided to find a new company to do business with
Like most people here who have reviewed I also have a terrible experience of littlewoods Ireland I like i Australia  ordered santa presents for my two girls  god children on 26th nov got emails stating goods being delivered Arrived in Ireland at 10pm Christmas Eve to discover the delivery was not made Had to try to experience to disappointed children that it wasnt theyre fault santa didnt deliver Since then I have been emailing regularly demanding a refund The response is usually 12 weeks late by a different person they ignore any requests made ie to get senior staff to contact me directly to refund my bank They avoid answering any questions or demands offer no apology and respond requesting additional ridiculous details eg proof of non delivery or state the refund has been made  which is not true with screenshots of evidence that no refund has been made sent to them regularly Im so frustrated with the process of dealing with them and would never purchase from them again and urge anyone who is considering it to save yourself the stress of being robbed

I had booked with lastminute in the past and had problems which I could eventually solve This time they wont even CARE about helping me I booked a return flight EZE  MAD with two connection flights
original ticket  last two legs of the return journey
1810 Sao Paulo Guarulhos International  GRU
Wait 5hrs 15mins

A day after I confirmed my reservation I receive an email from them saying one of the connection flights of my return journey SAU PAULO  BUENOS AIRES had been cancelled by the airline and that they had no alternative flight to offer me just a refund for that part of the journey So they actually offered me to depart from BUENOS AIRES but come back to SAO PAULO and stay there Not very helpful
I had to call and talk to THREE different agents until one ofthem was good enough like for referring my case to another department to find me an alternative flight They came back to me two days after with an alternative flight that suit us perfectly and we confirmed this option
confirmation of amended flight  last two legs of the return journey

AR7725 22APR SAO PAULO GUARULH  BUENOS AIRES 2015 2305
Soon after this confirmation I receiver yet another message from lastminute saying that my flight has been changed to again to another one with 13 hour layover in Sao Paulo No accommodation for the 13 hours layover was offered or anything to help the circumstantes I called the airline and they told me there is availability on the fight they originally moved us to AR7725 and it was not them changing our flight but the agency from which we bought the tickets lastminutecom I called them again to try to find a reasonable alternative flight with less layover and after four days they came back saying they have no alternative flights and they can only refund me which is not a solution as they ticket is now much more expensive than it was offered when I bought it approximately a month ago
third change on my original itinerary with 13 hours layover  last two legs of the return journey

There are TWO alternative flights for the 22nd that would allow us to come back home on the 22nd as we originally planned to Both flights are from Aerolineas Argentinas which is the airline we had the original flight that was cancelled with I checked with them and there is availability on both flight so if the airline canceled our flight and they have availability the same day they still have and we were already in one of them why did lastminute changed us again to a WORSE flight with THIRTEEN HOURS LAYOVER These are the flights available that day the first one is where we were already moved to but then CHANGED again

The customer care representatives have been mostly rude and useless to give a solution to a problem which was already resolved before they amended my itinerary for a third time I DO NOT RECOMMEND LASTMINUTECOM They will just take your money and rip you off No customer care as they simple DONT care once they took your money
My husbandand I have had a Very Unpleasant experience with this company I have spoke personally to John Mera My husband has spoke to his boss as well Neither of them have followed through with their word I suggest finding a different company to do business with
The car seat I bought was faulty and the customer service was rubbish The straps on the car seat wouldnt tighten properly to start with and then they stuck in the tightened position This is obviously a fault with car seat yet they still asked for video proof twice as they said I wasnt doing it correctly Then they have collected the car seat but a replacement wont be sent until they get it back in their warehouse leaving me without a car seat all weekend due to the fact that their product was faulty Very unhappy with this outcome
Flowers not delivered for the Valentines day Ordered 8 days before Price amazingly expensive for 0 service No feed back despites my emails sent
Do not use this website 
Website advertises next day delivery Bold type However Somewhere they list states not next day delivery Not obvious
Called when it didnt arrive within 3 days They Said my state wasnt next day delivery Instead it Should be there in 7 days Didnt arrive for 10 days
Not worth any small amount of money that I may have saved
Ok if you arent in need of supplies in any sort of timeframe
The delivery experience was a nightmare The dressers are smaller than I imagined They seem to be for children I am going to need to buy different ones Would not buy again from you
I purchased a camera system that never worked right out of the box I sent 3 separate emails none of which were even acknowledged Then I get an email saying that I have only a limited time to purchase something on sale Finally I started a claim with Paypal Still no answer They are totally irresponsible and without regard I will get my money back since it has Paypal protection but not because of them I do a large amount of online business and over 20 years and I have never enountered a worse seller Run and never look back from these fools
ordered us version of tv tuner got the europe version instead

NOT HAPPY
The folks at Omega were friendly enough but my main concern was safety
After leaving Auckland airport and travelling north I noticed that the bonnet hood of the Nissan Bluebird was wobbling Sure enough the bonnet was not secured and needed to be pushed down into a fully locked position
This could have been a major accident if it had suddenly released
Les Garrett Very helpful courteous great customer service very informative Told me about future posting options referrals and other posting options on ZipRecruiter
Had a chat with Tatiana online that took to long for simple responces wrote hello andor are you there twice as it took her minutes to respond I chat with 6 companies paychex chase bank of america mhelp salesforce quickbooks for support several times a year and this person was the worst I have ever dealt with on a chat She offered no CS other than a phone number no empathy to my needs and then disconnected the chat nothing more than you scripted thankyou
They rarely read your meter and thats basically their only job Every interaction with them involved them trying to get me to submit a meter reading for them They were incredibly expensive and when all other providers were giving double digit reductions they gave us a pittance
Food cold Chips soggy and cold
I was misled on a purchase I had placed a Mavic Pro on order and my charge card was charged on 11122016 When I placed the order I was told that it would arrive 1130127 That was delayed a few weeks then a few more week then a few more weeks After paying interest on the item for 2 months I finally canceled the order and was able to purchase the product at another website and received it in 2 days I think it unreasonable that my charge card was charged before this item was even in stock At 1000 charge I paid about 3040 in interest for an Item they never intended to ship Also when canceling the order I was informed that it would be shipped in Late February which probably woud have turned into MARCH
Been asked twice about the prescription but order still hasnt shipped
I tried to buy a pair of glasses from them but because of NUMEROUS errors on their part I cancelled the order the next day Since then Ive been fighting to get my full refund First they said they processed it Then they said they processed it for the wrong amount Then they wanted my PayPal account info so they could refund me the missing portion of my refund I paid via credit card not PayPal so its very odd they wanted to send me a refund via PayPal If they cant issue a 15115 refund properly in almost month and still counting do you really wanna trust them with your eyesight I wouldnt trust them to make a pair of glasses if they cant even handle simple refunds properly Plus if you do have a problem CLEARLY their Customer Service is horrible since they cant even issue a simple refund Buy your glasses elsewhere
1000 postage Outrageous Will never order anything from them again
I do not want to panic but still do not have a match ticket as early as Saturday family from abroad arrives to me especially for this event Can I get a phone number to your office or to courier if he has already tickets
I order a light blub that was delivered broken Ive emailed RS and asked then to send a replacement but had no response Now they want me to rate their service In a word RUBBISH
Although in your system it is market as delivered I have still not received my parcel I checked and somehow it is still with DHL waiting for delivery since 26012017
The driver showed up 15 minutes later from our scheduled time and his car was dirty I dont know if my experience was unusual but I will definitely not use this service again
I tried getting a Quote in a 2l car says invalid and same thing with a 18 17 16 15 14 I can Only get a Quote in anything under 14 and then pay for your kilometres when they run out as part of my last experience this is a scam will pay more money to the likes of axa and aviva
My package never came in the mail and when I called the customer service line for some help the girl on the line gave me a very icy tone and I could tell she did not offer ANY solutions although Im sure they deal with missing packages ALL THE TIME Poor service beware of placing an order from here they will ignore your calls and emails if your package never comes
I have been loyal customer of PhoneIndia for around last 2 years However i rate my recent experience with them as the worst service I ever received from a service provider
Phoneindias Ireland access number is down for more than 1 week now They have not taken any measure to restore the service yet When support team is contacted they have no clue when the service will be restored Support team says We dont have any timeframe to resolve the issue
While I am writing this I have total 748 minutes from my monthly plan which will expire in 2 week time and 177 in main balance I have discontinued my monthly plan and dont think that I I will ever recommend anyone to Phoneindia They dont value loyalty
Today I am suffering Tomorrowthe same thing can happen to you
Please be aware and use your concise before deciding to use service of Phoneindiacom
Good Luck
Yours Sincerely

I had a bad experience buying from Triple Crown Products I informed them Marianna and Erin Murphy via email that the owner of the company had to approve the preproduction sew out they sent me I also let them know that the owner was on vacation and that it would take some time for him to see the logo And I told them that I would contact them when he came back and approvesdisapproves the sew out Well they still sent me an email everyday about approval the same email asking the same thing They even researched our employees email and Erin Murphy sent her an email asking for me and the owner She also asked her if she can send her the logo I guess they wanted her to approve the logo First of all the employee has no authorization to approve such things Second they took this too far by finding out our employees email and contacting her regarding things that only the owner is authorized to do I do not understand why they could not wait if I had already informed them about the owner not being available The quality of the products is great But these people are way too pushy and want to make a sale fast and it seems like the customer is not allowed to take some time to approve the sew out They want approval immediately and if they dont get it they will contact you everyday and it does not matter if you say you will contact them when you have an answer Both the quality of the products and customer service is important for us I will not be making any future purchases from this place
I wanted my flowers to be deliverd in friday but they arrived on mondayI am verry disapointed I will never use this webside
My sales lady was great Online stated the bed I wanted was in stock making me think it was in the store This was not the case Also 85 fee to get a credit account seems a bit high Youre making profit on the purchases and the credit company is making profit from interest on the loan Why have an 85 fee
And the explanation below of the program fee is still not acceptable The fee is still 85 and theres no real explanation for it other than its extra money the customer has to pay out
No costumer support at all Product never arrived Terrible
Lieferung kam nicht an vallentienstag an 
Long story short Over 25 emails back and forth Also two of the wrong glasses sent End resultno glasses looking to get the right glasses from another vender What a waste of time it was to order glasses from this place Good luck on ordering glasses from this place Also something weird Ordered persols that are hand made in Italy came from china both glasses Mmm maybe knock offs
My husband and I have had Frontier for almost 7 years and only because they are literally the only option out here for internet where I live At least once a month we have internet outages The last experience was be beyond frustrated 2 weeks ago we lost internet I waited for it to come back like I always do but after a week it still wasnt resolved so I called frontier Person on the phone told me it was my modem that went bad after a system upgrade I was already irritated when she said that my new modem would arrive 24 days How does a business in todays world not have overnight options well here we are today day 4 of waiting for new modem I called them to find out where this is and they told me that no one made a ticket for this My modem had not been ordered I work from home My cell phone booster runs off internet 2 weeks without internet is TOTALLY unacceptable Even after talking with a supervisor they now tell me that the best they can do is send a tech out to my house on Friday It is currently only Tuesday Not only have I lost out on work time because I have had no internet at home for this longnot they want me to stay home all day INCASE a tech has to come to my house Also this supervisor said that he is sure that the problem isnt my modem at all but a line issue What else can I do so that more people dont have to deal with this and lose out on time and money with this company Do NOT pay for this if you have other internet provider options
I was called by Jennifer Moralez on 11617 immediately after posting an unacceptablebad review of this company She offered me a full refund if I agreed to remove my bad review off of this site After months of problems and of calling for assistance over and over again to no avail its amazing how they have been able to call me everyday to see if the refund posted to my credit card account so that the review would be removed I agreed to remove the bad review so I could get my 1084 refund as they also had the sofa I returned I am very thankful that I finally got my money back Thank you Jennifer for issuing my refund
I get a Quote from this company and I was told that the inspection process I wont even know that I was here is what I was told They were just taking some photographs The guy shows up today from Travelers knocking on my door asking me about my dog asking me about the garage questions already spent a half an hour on the phone with the agent answering In short I recommend you go local stay away from these internet sites Thank God I never cancel my old policy
I ordered 2 pair of pants which were shown to be in inventory at my local DXL just 5 minutes from my house It has now been 5 hours and still no email to notify me they are ready from pickup what exactly needs to take place that would take this long to pull 2 pair of pants off a rack that would require 5 hours I am tempted to cancel my order and just drive down to the store and buy them right now with no waiting Note to selfNEVER USE IN STORE PICK UP option  it only delays your purchase
On top of the shipping fee now we have to pay for taxthis sucks
Very Bad customer service Barcelona airport terminal 1 couldnt explain even whats happened till I came second time and then they explained that they are making over bookings Thats why my booking are canceled but money are charged from account They didnt notice about cancelation till I came to pick up car Do not believe what they say online that car will be guaranteed That is not true

Every delivery had damaged furniture and it took multiple deliveries to get it right Very difficult to get it corrected they wont take the furniture back until you take pictures of the damage and they get an ok from the company Not worth the frustration regardless of the price Will never order from them again and would NEVER recommend them
Got a super impatient customer service while inquiring my existing booking She asked for some information and apparently I understood her correctly While attempting to answer her question on the second try she just hung up the phone My German is not so good but she has shown no willingness to communicate and help the customer I will not recommend Opodo to my friends and will definitely avoid booking from them in the future
i order part on the phone by telling them my car reg mechanic told me part was wrong after fitting test wasted time and money sale team told me part was wrong after getting my car reg they were the one who placed order in first place now they telling me item not in stock i have to travel now stuck due to this not a very good 1st experience
too difficult to book
Ordered multiplie products was contacted and told they had to order one item and that my order would be sent out complete when item that needed to be ordered came in Later received one item and the rest still havent came in 2 weeks later 
VW Golf with licence nr 0715JJC in Teneriffe has dirty back seat Becasue it wasnt documented by picking up I was asked to pay for the cleaning fee Unfair
We had to cancel our stay at Gala Hotels and got a confirmation by email that our refund wolud be repaid within 21 Days but it has been several months since we got the answer and still havent got anything back  We send an email with their answer attached and still no answer or Money
I chose Public Storage because it was close to my house and the rates were reasonable The check in was fine and the representative was nice Then the crazy started
Even tho the access hours are posted didnt mean that the office was open so no carts availablesometimes for hours in the middle of the day The parking lot was full of homeless people so I didnt feel safe going by myself Then the elevator brokemy space is on the second floor So I am schlepping stuff up and down stairs
Today I arrived when the website said you were open but your employee was 30 minutes late And the elevator is still not working So I take a load up two flights of stairs and the interior door is locked When I go back down the stairs the door at the bottom locked behind me so now I am locked in a stairwell A back door has been propped open with a piece of cardboard  Im the first one here which means the building wasnt secure all night and when I walk around the side of the building the gate is also standing wide open
There are other customers standing around waiting for the late employee and they are all complaining that this is an incompetent business the elevator will take forever to fix and that management is not paying any attention to this property
As soon as I can I am moving out  Ive only ben here two weeks If the elevator is still broken and I cant get a cart I will be writing bad reviews on every social media outlet I can find
Ridiculous frustrating and unprofessional
Attempted to revise flight info
Stated they were going to charge me a cancellation fee in light of the fact that I had purchased additional insurance to allow for changes within 24 hours
The representative spoke very broken english and to hard to communicate with
Pattetic support
If you contact them they will ignore you Awesome
I ordered a DJI 4 Quad copter for my husband as a gift In the ad it said brand new but when we received it the quad copter had already been opened and the security sticker that should have been on the case was gone Inspecting the quad copter all of the sensor protectors that cover the sensors had already been removed This quad had already been out and used Very disappointing The virtual viewer was a joke because it is very cheap and there is a divider between your eyes that blocks your view and you can see a black line between your eyes Very cheap We will never buy from Beachcamera again because they lied and sell cheap for not a cheap price
I applied for information and pretty much got bullied into paying the almost 600 fee with the promise that there are toooons of financing available for my business once on there is absolutely nothing that I or my business qualify for I went to my city hall and there where tons more without having to pay I feel like Ive been scammed I called again to try to get my money back It was a guy who didnt speak english and didnt understand what I wanted By the end of it he still insisted that there where some for me and told me he wanted to double check I then proceeded to say no Im the site as we speak He told me that he would go check and call me back in 2448 hours and hung up on me
Binding is in rough shape considering the price I paid
Had a small problem but their customer service team couldnt care less They also have an AU site but nothing is shipped from AUS its all from the UK  i dont like this at all

I am very upset with my rental experience with RedSpot I had initial rental contract for 3 days As my husband caught a severe flu we got stuck at home in Canberra and could not drive a car back to Sydney we have a baby daughter and I could not neither leave her with my sick husband nor drive with her So eventually we had to extend our contract to 14 days but we had to pay it using our initial daily rate ie 116 per day Having experience with other rental companies where the rate was adjusted according to the actual rental period I am very disappointed with RedSpot staff being so inconsiderate in this unfortunate and unexpected family situation Also we had to wait more than one hour to get our rental agreement ready Waiting so long was the last thing we were willing to have after a long flight from Europe I will never rent there again as I have paid them already too much
Bad service didnt save money cost more
Guys I was super skeptical about getting it 80 off I promise this is totally real I got my book right after and am ready to start This is so great and I even got an offer for a free recipe guide Great website 
The portion sizes were big but over catered on the carbs and NO green veg or variety
Sauces were very adverse but assisted to make bland meals palatable
Grilled chicken and Baramundi were nice though Tuna was ok lamb and Kangaroo were a real struggle to eat
Overall I was very disappointed in the quality and verity
GTarcade had a very good game that I loved Magerealm but after about 6 months of playing they slowed support down drastically until there seems to be no more devs working on supporting or advancing the game and all the while they still have their recharge button working just fine I spent tons of time and a decent amount of money and now I have nothing to spend their in game currency that I paid for with real money on because they stopped running all events for the past 2 weeks I still have thousands of diamonds with no way that I can find to get a refund I will NEVER play another GTarcade game again
I am 110 dissatisfied with this company I ordered 120 worth of paint on 1517 and today is 2917 and I still havent received my order I paid through paypal and disputed the charge The seller responded telling me that the product should have been drop shipped I still havent received the paint None of their phone numbers work DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY Im still waiting for my product or refund
I placed an order for compression stockings from Lymphedema Products LP on January 17 I did receive conformation from them and also from Pay Pal that my account had been charged On January 18 I received an email from Jessica Stone She writes
My name is Jessica Stone and I am the Assistant Director of Sales for Lymphedema Products I have noticed that this is your first online order with us and I just wanted to take this opportunity to introduce myself to you Lymphedema Products has been proudly serving customers for over 15 years and if there is anything I can do for you in the future I am only an email or phone call away Lymphedema Products sells a wide variety of compression therapy products including custom sized garments and custom bandaging alternatives Please dont hesitate to get in touch with me if you have any questions or concerns
I thought that was nice but I never received any kind of shipment notice or tracking number After 9 days I was curious why I had not received my order so I called the toll free number and spoke to a representative of LP and gave him my order number He placed me on hold while he checked He came back briefly and said he had contacted Juzo fulfillment company sending the stocking and said they were looking for the order and again placed me on hold Three of four songs played through while Im waiting on hold and finally he comes back on and said he apologized for placing me on hold for so long but he asked for confirmation of my phone number and said he would call me back shortly with information That call with an explanation as to what happened never came The next day I had an email from LP It stated
We thought youd like to know your order 144497 has shipped
It included the Fed Ex shipment Tracking number
With no further communications with LP I can only assume that my original order was lost and after my contacting them they placed a new order which shipped on Friday after my call about the delay For this reason I can not offer a recommendation to Lymphedema Products It will be Monday before Fed Ex delivers my package I just hope it is correct
Postage fee for returns is ridiculous Wiggle and Co offer free returns However when I ordered an item and the wrong item they still charged me over 6 return postage Mantels customer service genius someone calling himself Freek was critical and augmentative when I let Mantel know Use Wiggle and Co not these cowboys theyll be in administration in a few months anyway if Freek has anything to do with it
They are a rip off and crappy quality
This was the first time I used Airtasker and unfortunately it was not the best experience I had selected someone to do my job and we were then organising a time for pick up and delivery we had confirmed the time I sent through all of the details confirming again and I then got a cancellation through Airtasker at 525am when the task was to be completed at 7am My push notifications only sometimes work so I didnt receive the notification and I received no further contact from the guy I messaged and called him to see where he was and he had blocked my number I know this isnt Airtaskers fault but i feel they could have done more It is also frustrating that I cant review him because he did not complete my job Airtasker need to push any cancellations through as a message I then had to get someone else to do the job which actually went to plan and received a text to confirm the job had been done to release the funds How is it you can inform me by message when you want to pay someone but you cant inform me by message when someone is cancelling my job 15 hours before its due to be picked up I feel this needs to be reviewed As mentioned however the second guy I got was great however im still cautious to use Airtasker now if I ever need something done on a certain date considering they can cancel with no notice
Dishonesy salewomem calls at late hours to demand you change your review Contradicts her own story of orders saying an order is placed yet in the same sentence says there never was an order Do not order from if you expect to be treated respectfully by the HR Im only editing this to warn others of the dishonest advertising that i FEEL is dishonest These people will remove negative feedback claiming defamation for selling dishonest products They will call without your knowledge of having your number
I ended up buying quite a bit of different product Good salesman at DIAhe told me to try for a month and if not satisfied I could get a refund I bought these 125 and called and left a message 1229  I never received a call back and was busy so I didnt email until Jan 11th and the return email said it was too late for refund Obviously I am very dissatisfied Thank you
I purchased some items in early January 2017 Two were in stock the other was due to come back into stock in 2 weeks time It was nearly 3 weeks before the two items in stock were even dispatched and I still dont have the third item I was charged for all 3 items immediately when I ordered  a lot of other retailers do not charge you until the item is in stock I wont be ordering from Zodee again
I did not order through you I ordered the book through Amazon but somehow you got involved so now I have two books The one you sent is not in good condition and not worth the money you charged me I have not a clue as to how you got involved in my Amazon order Would love to have my credit card credited with this purchase and Ill donate your book to the local library

I was happy about the company untill the end when we found a electricity company This lady was very pushy about me getting this great deal i had told her i need talk to my husband about and call back later She kept push for me to get it and told me i can cancel the electricity if my hubby does not agree I felt like i got push into something when i really wanted talk to my husband before making a deal Yes it was a great deal but again i really wanted to talk to my husband first I was not happy about this at all She also kept implying that i had call her company three times when this was the first
They sent me the wrong SD cards I asked to just exchange them and they would not First they offered me a small discount in the price of the cards they did send These cards will not work in my application I want what I paid for They then offered me a bit more of a discount after they knew the cards would not work in my GoPro What am I going to do with SD cards that wont work They then made me return the other cards first which is fine but I had to go through the entire reordering process again Now I see the price is even more that the original order They have yet to credit me for my return and I know they received the items back
The cartridge arrived very promptly excellent turn around
However the ink cartridge seems like it has dried out and it does not print clearly looks like it is running out of ink from day one Next time I will buy a genuine cartridge so I can be guaranteed quality prints
I ordered glasses frames from them over 6 weeks ago and they still havent arrived At the time I placed my order they were listed as in stock Then the status was changed to out of stock and now its back to in stock but they still havent been shipped
Why would they list a product on their website that they cant deliver
I had used this service over the last several years and had been happy with the service Then I got a thank you and a picture of an arrangement I had sent to family
It was sort of close to what I ordered so I wrote it off as a slight mistake
I know it is probably difficult to get exactly what you see as an arrangement
My last experience I spent just under 200 for a Christmas arrangement that was not remotely what I requested Pictures were sent again I was quite embarrassed by what was received I notified the company twice of my displeasure asking for a refund or credit I have never received a response of any kind Do they think we will not see the arrangements Stay away from this company Not worth the fear
I va ordered one MEIZU M2 and the sim isnt working in EuropeI ve sent the item back to them and they promised that they are going to resolve the problem but they didntI get the phone afte 4 months and the sim is not still workingFurtherome they didnt send me the charger as well
I will not purchase any products again They are inferior in quality and over priced
Customer service for placing order was very difficult due to tie up in credit department Had to reorder three times unbelievable 
I thought I would receive my live plants in the fall or the spring I purchased in September i didnt received in fall so I expected them in the spring but with no communication I was not sure Then without notice the plants arrived in the middle of winter I wrote and asked what to do and why Someone said just plant them you are in California and California doesnt have winters But it had been raining for days and I couldnt get them planted for a week After I planted the banana plant all the leaves turned brown and wilted I sent a picture and was told the plant is not dead and will be fine I paid for a 3 foot tall plant and if it lives will be about one foot
Then after i wrote a negative review i got an email with instructions on how to return a dead plant Not my first choice
When I received my glasses I noticed immediately I could not wear them because something was off with the lenses I am unsure as of to why The only thing I can figure is maybe the transition lenses with the thin lenses made it difficult to see I noticed while wearing the glasses I have a hard time focusing and absolutely can not drive with them I have another pair with the same prescription so I know that isnt the reason I looked into returning them but the policy states they would only refund 50 of the lenses and that I had to pay for shipping and handling I personally think that is ridiculous and dont even want to go through that trouble again It took so long to receive them in the first place I will just take them to a local place and have new lenses replaced and suck up the costs I learned my lesson Im never buying glasses online again Too much uncertainty
I organize family vacations in Latin America all the time and I usually book tickets for 56 passengers at a time Youd think that any travel agent would want to keep my business but not these guys
So it all started with me booking tickets for 5 passengers and mistyping one of the names  I missed one letter in the family name of one of the passengers
I called Travelgenio immediately about 2 hours after booking the reservation trying to correct my mistake and thats when my nightmare began
What followed was 10 days of endless phone calls and emails
Every time Id call Travelgenio they would tell me something different
I would then have to call the airline to verify the information only to discover that I have been outright lied to by Travelgenio
Eventually 10 days after the fact I was told that I need to cancel and rebook the reservation But guess what the price of the ticket had literally tripled during that time
Travelgenio have certainly lost my trust and my future business
I am utterly disappointed by their lack of competence and their level of service
People should be warned not to expect any level of customer service whatsoever
Just for laughs heres one of my email to Travelgenio summarizing the situation
Hi
I have been calling Travelgenio almost every day this week and every time I get a different answer
Can you please put me in touch with a supervisor or someone else in charge as I no longer trust the information I receive
1 I first called on Monday Jan 30th just a couple of hours after I purchased tickets for 5 passengers to alert you that one of the names is misspelled
I was told that there is no problem to change the name of one of the passengers as there was only one letter difference I was told that Travelgenio will put a note on my reservation for the airline to see and execute the correction
2 I talked to the airline and I was told that they do indeed see the note requesting the name change that there is no fee for executing the change and that Travelgenio should contact them directly for further information on how to execute the change
3 I called Travelgenio again the next day Jan 31st to see if the name change was being processed
Travelgenio told me again that they have added a note to the reservation confirmed that there is no fee for the name change and theres nothing else for them to do
4 I double checked with the airline and I was again told there is no fee to execute the name change but the process needs to be initiated by the travel agent
5 I called back Travelgenio to communicate back that information Jan 31st
A lady who was quite rude on the phone told me that there is no need to change the name as there is only one letter difference and that I will be allowed to board nonetheless I was assured that there can be a difference of up to 3 letters and I will still be allowed to board
6 I called the airline one more time to verify this information and I was told that it was wrong and that I do need to change the name on the reservation
7 I called Travelgenio one more time Feb 1st
I was told one more time that there is no fee to change the name and that they will finally initiate the procedure to do it
8 Today Feb 3rd I receive an email from Travelgenio telling me that I need to cancel and rebook the ticket and that I need to pay close to 500 EUR for this even though the price of the ticket was only 183 USD
Why was I not told this the first time I called The price of the ticket was still the same on Monday But I was being misled for a full week and now the price has tripled
I was led to believe that there is no problem with the name and that either the reservation did not have to be modified or that it was already modified What would have happened if I hadnt followed up
I was assured several times by both Travelgenio and GOL Airlines that there is no fee for executing the name change I therefore demand that you change the name free of charge
I am highly disappointed in your customer service representatives I was misled and outright lied to
Can you please put me in touch with a supervisor so we can sort this out I prefer communicating by mail from now on in order to keep a record of our conversation
Maybe one day they might Quote the actual price
I am still awaiting product delivery
bad customer service no update no tracking no confirmation of delivery I would rather pay more with other company than do business with Euroflorist Really bad
Employees are incompetent Would not recommend nor would I spend another penny with this so called company Only good thing is delivery guys were awesome
they have zero support and even have the nerve to tell you to send personal info to a public forum for modsregular non employed people to get involved
I just need the address of their registered agent in usa so I can slap a lawsuit on them for theft of services money and time I have so I dont mind making them spend theirs for continuances until a court date actually arrives
Horrible people who STEAL your money DO NOT use this service

What a joke waited in all morning before during and after the hour window 09561056 then i was sent a patronizing email saying attempted delivery no one in to sign etc so I checked the photo link on my email and the location is no where near me hence the absence of the sorry we missed you card rang DPD to be told the driver had every intention of returning today to deliver my all important s7 screen protector from amazon to go on a brand new phone so really important to prevent scratches and he would definitely be here by 1 pm or a little later and ive paid the extra 5 express guaranteed before 1 pm next day delivery charge on amazon too so DPD have robbed me Ive been standing by my gate at the end of my drive the last 2 hours in the pouring rain its now 230 and no sign of DPD and no offer of compensation or good will gestureI will from now on avoid at all costs rang back again and no answer just yet more patronizing  sorry you werent in to sign for your parcel voice prompts I WAS in DPD so stop second guessing and assuming on the automated phone messaging system DPD used to be ok but now they seem worse than yodel never again  a whole day wasted Im sure if it had been a 50 inch TV theyd have left it in the shed unsigned useless if I get a pathetic automated reply on here such as email so and so and we will get it sorted I will send my phone number for DPD to ring me to sort out some good will gesture or cover the cost of my time wasted its a whole day totally wasted now im all behind with my schedule

My father who is 87 yrs old has had the hardest time just getting his phone connection to work He moved 1 block away from his old apartment where he already had telephone land line service with Frontier He moved out on Jan 21st and was told that afternoon his service with the same number and service would be on in the afternoon Well it did not come on until Wednesday It took 4 days for his phone to finally have service I complained to Customer Service which really did no good I even spoke to a Supervisor who ended up telling me the tech dept would have to help and there was nothing she could doThen that week end his phone had no service from FriTues The next week end he had no service from FriWeds I called them pretty upset as my dad is 87 yrs old and legally blind I told them HE NEEDS A WORKING PHONE LINE They FINALLY sent someone out to check on the problem and it turns out it the line needed a Module with a cap I guess the module was moving around without a cap and the line would work and then not workThe service man finally fixed it and after 13 days without service it is their fault and I want those 13 days credited to his account I just cant find a way to email this complaint to them If we had a different choice I would definitely switch Dont have Frontier for you telephone or anything else I wasted MANY hours on the phone with them just trying to get service for my dads phone A horrible experience
Flowers were not delivered on the date They come from a city 8 hrs away from Munich I wouldnt call a city 8 hrs away from Munich as local The flowers were advertised as it would be delivered on the 14 the and its the 15th and she hast received her flowers Tracking number doesnt even provide city and shows as delivered Somebody else has them I contacted customer service via email and no answer This is a mess Will never buy flowers here

Ordered a 29 Paddle Board accessory from this company It was not apparent that they were shipping from Europe at time of order It has been over 45 days since the order and I still do not have a product and they have my money The Customer Service is hard to reach and does nothing to resolve the problem other than send a tracking number showing that it was never delivered
I havent bought from Chewyalmost did but didnt for a reason Late this morning I added Purinas Fortiflora to the cart in addition to another item A few hours later its 245 in the afternoon I went back to the site about to register for an account to find that the price has changed from 2500 a box to 2799 within hours
I called them up and was told that their prices do fluctuate to reflect the demands Is this stock market or are we talking about the price of precious metals
I decided not to continue with my new account registration Was going to use their first order discount Without it their prices arent really better than Amazon or Ebay
I had placed the ordered and paid for two day shipping I needed what I had ordered fast The product was shipped over 10 days later I will never again order from them again
It took 3 weeks before they could process and send the product but payment was taken right away when I placed the order I think they should take the money no earlier than when they have a product to send
They are liars I was told i would be refunded my order and SHIPPING payment if i returned the items Shipping was 70 Dollars but the seller never refunded me for it

I ordered on New Years Day expecting delivery on the 3rd of Jan I didnt recive my order until the 10 I rang the store several times and got the reponse that it was interlink with the delay when speaking to interlink they said they didnt have the goods spending nearly 100 I got the attitude from staff we can refund your money but I have to send items back at my own cost when I received them and no interest in compensation
60 seconds is not enough time to make an adequate selection the first time you use the service It makes the shopping experience very nervewracking Also you stock for the high wasted leggins was very low to nonexistant This also makes it difficult to make your selections in 60 seconds There was almost an insurmountable glitch in getting back to the shopping cart to delete items not in stock and shop for those that were in stock
I have made two orders Flowers havent been delivered The customer service doesnt respond to my letters Very bad It is ready to discuss this situation on email

This company took my money and I never received my book I have emailed at least six times and called at least five times with no response except the same email twice stating that my book shipped out All I asked for was a tracking number which I never got This company is fraudulent This company has email responses that are all happy and a lady who answers their voicemails very politely They smile as they take your money Very very slimy I will be reporting them to my bank as fraud and also to the Better Business Bureau
poor quality tasteless disappointment I enjoyed shame
Very hard to see and find the items I wanted to
Never got any product including my invisible fence Worthless customer service mmfyi outsourced to India FYI Absolutely awful care for customer service and are hinging on illegal activity and charges without offering product or refund Items were never delivered or even attempted to ship
The product we ordered works great was easy to download and does what we wanted We inadvertently were registered for 365 something and have been charged 999 per month I asked to cancel and receive a refund I was charged a second time in Dec and that was refunded Great  I was still charged in Dec Lesson be very vigilant watching credit card charges The MyChoice representative was calm understanding and sounds helpful But I may still need to have bank block charges
Further to my last post the phones are back on again this morning but I have just spent the last 30 minutes calling from the UK constantly being told the whole time I am number 1 in the queue Still no reply to my emails This is Customer Disservice When is someone going to respond to me Please dont come on here and ask me to call or mail your customer service department as it means nothing Total refund please Nothing else will suffice

The glasses were delivered quickly and the prescription was correct However I ordered two pairs and neither of them fitted as they did in the home trial I had to take the glasses to my opticians for them to be adjusted so they would fit at all The frames appeared to be completely different to those sent in the home trial and both had an extremely poor fit when mine were delivered
I recently placed an order from kohls I received my order and 2 out of 4 items were incorrect When calling customer service they will not send me the correct items and correct their mistake Their policy is for me to go to the store returning incorrect items getting a refund and then i have to reorder the correct items If that is not enough of a hassel I received Kohls cash which will be taken off when returning the items So because someone in there warehouse made 2 mistakes i lose my Kohls cash have to go to the store and reorder my items hoping they are still in stock I will NEVER order from Kohls online again for all this hassel and Kohls not willing to correct their mistake I have to correct their mistake

I have been a customer since 2009 if I remember correct When I bought it back then the price was 9 DKK Today 140217 I receive an email with a topic that says something like 67 more disk space for your website email and much more When I read the email Im chocked to see that its actually a warning that the price is going up and now cost me 19 pr month Apparently the much more is more than 100 price tag I think This is totally unacceptable
When I log into the service I see that I have payed more than 9 pr month since 2014 Well do I feel silly So I go back in my email archive to find the email where they warn me about this price change and what do I find The same  approach the email says I get more disk space and features in the subject field and when I read it I find the warning How can you trust a company like this Here I am a trusting idiot well lesson learned Im out
Please share this with everyone you know maybe they too have overseen this warning

My normal internet speed with frontier is 1 Mbps down and 01 Mbps up This service has been like this for the past 25 years I have opened 6 technical support cases with frontier but there are no issues between my computer and the frontier back end systems The issue is 100 on Frontiers end in that they do not have the back end systems upgraded enough to handle the number of people that use their service The only reason to stick with frontier is that their service is the lowest cost service around there is NO other hardwired service here  cable or DSL I live in the 56011 zip code
I ordered the puzzle piece keychain set The picture on the website displayed the phrase BEST FRIENDS as being split on each piece BE and FRI on one side ST and ENDS on the other so when you put them together you can read the full words Cute idea When I received them the split words were centered on the pieces so BE and ST were not anywhere near each other when the puzzle pieces were connected thus completely missing the point and certainly not like the website pic Very disappointed
I ordered a product using two gift cards and a little extra money on Friday January 6 from the Marbles website The order was cancelled Monday January 9 saying the website mistakenly showed the product was in stock when it wasnt They cancelled the small portion of the transaction going through my credit card but my gift cards still show that theyve been used and have a 0 balance I contacted customer service Monday evening and again Thursday evening and have not heard anything back from them And then Thursday the product I ordered is back in stock Which means they could have just delayed my order until then and fulfilled it at that point I have had no response from customer service after a full week at this point
I had to rebook a pick up 4 times before my parcel was collected
Although the prices are good customer service leaves a lot to be desired My order was incomplete and it has been more than 10 days since I reported the issue and Im still waiting for the contacts I ordered and they have been paid for I have to keep calling to follow up they do not seem to be able to keep me updated Im not sure the hassle is woth the discount

Very negative experience The shipping date on Opticontactscom was posted as the same as the order date DAY 0 I thought great Then 4 days later I call since no tracking number was posted and they say theyll email me the tracking number Then the shipping date on Opticontactscom gets modified to DAY 4 surreptitiously I call again speak to unfriendly customer service then receive the USPS Priority Mail Tracking Number According to USPS the package didnt actually get to the USPS origin site until DAY 4 Estimated delivery date is DAY 6 On DAY 6 no package arrives and its listed on USPS as In transit Its DAY 7 and still nothing and its still listed on USPS as In transit and expected delivery DAY 6 And Opticontacts site still doesnt even list the Tracking Number
Was very dismayed and unhappy when I checked into my motel for the evening When I booked and paid for the room 4 weeks before my arrival date I was told that this motel accepted pets and that there was no extra charge When I arrived I discovered this was not the case The room had to be changed and there was an extra 2000 charge for my 2 pets The person booking the room for me should have known the pet policy Will not be booking thru them again
Delay after delay on backorder forced me to cancel my order and go elsewhere

I ordered a pair of sunglasses at the end of November and just received the end of Jan I originally got an email saying stick was confirmed then continued to get weekly emails saying delayed 59 more days After almost a month I called and the person said they should be there in about a week Of course that didnt happen and I got more emails saying delayed Finall after almost 2 month I called again and they said they would ship them out right away
The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one was that the price was better than I could find elsewhere

I did a promotion through them for a 10 gift card As I checked out the item was listed as the promotion price but when I checked out I was billed for the regular amount I When I contact them through email asking for a refund for the unused card I was told that I missed the promotion period because of a time zone difference That was a lie as my email for the order verification logged the time I called customer service and asked to speak with a manager I was given the same person to whom I was lied to through email He never let me speak the the manager and I was given yet
another excuse as to why I couldnt get a refund
Very poor service I ordered a 400lb weight set along with accessories At 1mos I still have not received them Road Runner freight seems to have misplaced or lost the order Inbox fitness only says that they will look into it Wouldnt even give me a contact name or number or a timeframe as to what will happen next Kind of the brush off Were very sorry but oh well Not good I would be very careful ordering from them

We ordered a Elizabethan Classics exposed shower in August 2 months after installation the chrome crossbar below the riser cracks and water is spraying out I called efaucets and they tell us the replacement part is in stock ships in 24 to 48 hours I call back in 5 days later the learn that the part hasnt shipped and no ETA as when it will It is our only shower and is now inoperable with no ETA for a fix Received in November paid a plumber to install it
today the replacement cracked in the same place with water spaying everywhere I called efaucets and apparently I am the only one that has experienced this issue let alone twice They are still stocking and selling this shower  avoid them
I can not recommend Elizabethan Classics or efaucets
Ive ordered four products from the company One was delivered very promptly Two were very late One was canceled by the company three days later because they couldnt fulfill it

I received painting in good time considering the distance it had to travel However I sent an email just TWO days late to request a return and was completely turned down because Id passed the 7day return deadline I had no idea that 2 days would be such a huge violation the time allowed to judge a painting youve never seen in real before receiving is too short especially considering the fourfigure prices of most works My opinion is they purposely restrict it in order to give themselves advantage over the buyer  not exactly equitable when dealing in items as subjective as art
It didnt meet my expectation at all The bouquet was really beatiful in the pictures but when I got it it was a disappointment I could understand if its just a little difference but it was not what I expected at all The Winter dream bouquet was mediocre it didnt have the kottar and much much less flowers than the in the picture Soo disappointed Will never order again from Euroflorist
My friends and I decided to have a short getaway over at Lexis Hibiscus Port Dickson and booked our Seaview room using Agoda in December 2016 for our trip on 18 February 2017 We even sent another email requesting for early check in through Agoda and in which they have responded to us that we will be able to My friend then checked her email and Agoda account on 17 February 2017 to get our resort details and the booking was stated CONFIRMED
We left on 18 February at 730am happily through a long journey and went to check in To our utter shock we were told that our booking were CANCELLED Naturally we FREAK out We did not understand why it was cancelled and at the same time the resort has a bad WiFi connection which makes it even harder to check on our status After a long time we were managed to get the connection and went back to the email and status in Agoda account and found out it was cancelled and an email was sent ONLY at 936am on the same day at 18 February 2017 This blew our mind Without proper notification and Agoda decided to just cancelled our bookings 5 HOURS before our check in time The worst thing it  for some reason our bookings was transferred to BOOKINGCOM God knows why and thats why the resort couldnt trace it for a while
And because of this we spent 2 more hours to resolve this and get a walk in price and room not the best view
PS USE AGODA AT YOUR OWN RISK
Vision direct are a farce The advertised the sunglasses I ordered and psi for but were unable to source find or deliver the item I wanted They continues to advertise the same pair despite being unable to deliver Do not believe their slick hype and invenantory They are unlikely to hold the stock they sell Very disappointing I will be going elsewhere for sure

I received a gift certificate to your site and have not spent it in 2 months because there is nothing ever available I finally placed an order and am sure I will have to return the leggings because they were not available in my size Nothing I liked was available in my size Also I find it VERY disconcerting that I was unable to use my gift certificate and receive items at a sale price It is outrageous that a person has to choose between purchasing an item at a sale price or using a gift certificate Just so we are clear  gift certificates are  that customers SHOULD be able to spend in anyway they like Not allowing customers to receive a discount and use their gifted  is not a good way to do business
Ive always been very happy with Colorado Pens service and products This latest order was time sensitive so I requested and paid handsomely for twoday delivery I received confirmation that the order had shipped Thursday 2 February The pen was a birthday gift and the recipient was leaving home to travel to Europe on Monday I believe that the twoday delivery for which I paid should have gotten it to him on Saturday I corresponded with him after his arrival in Europe and the pen did not arrive on Saturday I am very disappointed I will of course continue to do business with Colorado Pen as this is just one lapse among a number of good experiences but you disappointed me on this one M Young
It is unfortunate that the information provided in your response regarding Saturday delivery is not is not readily available on the websiteorder page That in is obviously not common knowledge Had I been aware I wouldnt have paid extra for a speedy delivery Mark

I bought my current COOLFIRE IV TC100 on line with no issues The service was fast Works perfect However I was given a gift of the same product which was purchased in Liffey Valley shopping centre before Christmas 2016 The tank leaked The shop assistant kindly sent the tank back to VIP headquarters There was no follow up despite attempts by me to ask what was happening Im not a happy customer No follow up customer service or no replacement tanks available to purchase for this product At 80 I would expect to be a satisfied customer Not so Disappointed with VIP Surely there should be some type of compensation 
I have a tmobile USA phone and they said that they will unlock it in a few days after waiting 10 days I asked whats going on they answered me saying its a global delayed then after I asked for refund no one answer either by mail or phone then finally someone answered me told me that refund usually takes up to two days

I used Flight Hub for the first time a few days ago to purchase a round trip flight to San Diego I was using my phone to make the purchase and I had issues with the page refreshing and deleting information I had already entered However it didnt delete all the information just some It took about 5 tries of reentering and getting error messages that it wasnt filled until I finally got through In the process though it must have taken the wrong spelling of the middle name My phone kept auto correcting and I had to override it I figured this shouldnt be a big deal and I would just call to get one letter changed At first the call was going smoothly and Rem assured me that he would do everything he could to fix it After 25 minutes on the phone he said there would be a 75 fee for changing one letter for the middle name which is optional I explained to him my situation multiple times and he kept cutting me off I felt like he wasnt even listening which made me angry He also kept asking me to prove how the website wasnt working which wasnt reasonable After talking to West Jet and Air Canada those were the airlines we booked with they said there wouldnt be a fee I was very frustrated with the whole experience and I will not be booking with Flight Hub in the future nor will I be recommending it It was a very negative experience
Update I just received a call from Flight Hub I thought it was a great that they were getting back to me They left a number to call back which I did Denise took the call and she had no idea what was going on and was not able to provide any help This call wasted another 10 minutes and still did not solve any problems
I ordered 3 products online which after 1 week are not yet delivered Im based in Milan if they cannot ensure a good delivery on a major city I dont want to image what it would happend if you are in a small town Customer Service totally unresponsive I requested the cancelation of the order which it was replied saying they will deliver the package again
I understand it might be a total incompetence from the delivery company but I paid to Prozis so they need to be responsible for it
NEVER AGAIN if you can avoid this company do it next time I will buy at Decathlon
Here is my final communication with my expert My expert was very helpful
Relly
Thank you for the help on the car I accept your answer I would rate your help as very good I would however say this website is very annoying and difficult to navigate I clicked on the accept button but just got an error I called customer help and left a message but they never returned my call I think it is up to you to convince them to pay you This website makes it difficult to set up a user name and password It is often difficult to find the log in page It is sometimes hard to find my existing question The only way I can find an existing question is to cut and paste from the emails you send me The site frequently prompts me to start a new question Please pass along my concerns to customer service
Thanks

I ordered a deluxe version of the Birthday Bouquet and got something that wasnt even close The arrangement was not similar and there were no purple flowers only a few different colored substitutes way less flowers than what was shown PLUS greenery put in with FERNS There were no ferns in the pictured arrangement The flowers were not arranged at all like what I paid for I paid EXTRA for delivery by 1pm and it didnt get there till 4pm The said theyd refund the delivery upgrade but didnt Then when I saw a photo of the arrangement she got VS the one I ordered I called them They leave me on hold for over an hour or hang up with me Do not order with these guys They are not in your neighborhood They use other crappy florists that dont give you what you ordered I will be filing with the BBB and FTD Order 3983522 and photos available
It took forever for my book to processed and then they wouldnt accept one of my books for damage that was not caused by me I had recieved the book that way Then the check I recieved couldnt be cashed due to their error It was not a good experience at all
Careful of this company Ordered on line for a West Palm beach family that had a death in the family Excited by the reviews Received a message via text that plant was delivered Waited a few hours for a thank you response which never came so I called only to be told my gift never arrived and they were home all morning receiving other gifts Called customer service and their response was tried but no one home I said that excuse is unacceptable because other gifts were received this morning and my text message said delivered If I had not further investigated I would have paid for NOTHING Still on phone waiting f
or resolution CAREFUL of this companyrefunded 
Staff good and helpful Car with marks on every panel either dented or scratched plus marked front and back Took 35 minutes to check over car and both Goldcar and me to take photographs The boast that Goldcar has the most modern fleet does not apply in Lanzarote I am a member of Goldcar Club and had first class car in Gran Canaria in November and Crete in May but this car was just not good enough and should not have been hired out 
A volte fantastica la merce a volte un disastroassistenza pero al top
I previously had normal experiences with Flugladende
But this time I had my worst experience with them
They provided me a wrong flight connections 2 transits inside Saudi Arabia which is not allowed and later when asked for refund they are pointing out their finger at the airlines If you dont have enough sense to check the preconditions before sending your customers an Itinerary you are just unfit to be in this field
Went to collect an order from the store and found the staff to be uninterested in my needs as I needed to return the item which was too small They did not seem to interested in helping me find a replacement item

I had the same problem as Geoffrey Brown  Booking process was simple I am happy with the price and service On Wednesday I received notification of a minor itinerary change I have tried using the link in the email but after choosing requests in the customer service screen it just freezes I have tried numerous times on my IPad and notebook Please advise if there is an issue or I am doing something wrong I have been linked an itenerary which shows no changes as well Also there is no contact email address
The hair is too short on one side More hair should be added to look full Also too small to fit completely on my head and I have an average size head
I will not buy anything from this site again because i bought a camera in november and i am still waiting for it  I already write several email and they respond only if my adress is write
Thanks
The book seller described the copy as being in acceptable condition
However the recipient of this copy found that its cover was creased
and the text full of writing by a previous owner The recipient is a relative
mine She had asked me to order a copy for her and now she is disappointed because she had planned to present this copy to somebody
else
Other book sellers are careful in their descriptions of the condition of books so I had grown used to receiving used books that looked very
clean and like new
Promised cheaper bills but are generally 2030 euro dearer I dont get it
read about playasia good feedback and trusted to them did order 39965283 they cancelled the order once I did it money not returned yet I think they will take for refund 37 days But in any way I did just one order and paid with credit card with vbv password they once cancelled it why Now I read many messages that they as scammers will ask western union and promise something solve with them account team but as write many other people it will not help If you will want lost money nervous and respect so buy from playasia
Let me summarize my story
On the 21st of December I decided to order a hose and dustbags on your website so placed an order
I took quite a while before I received those and unfortunately they were not the good ones eventhough your site said that they were suitable for the vacuum cleaner that I have
So I sent you various messages to tell you it wouldnt work and you kept asking me to send you pictures of the dust bags though I had told you that I didnt need any bags if I didnt have the right hosewhats the use of buying new bags for a vacuum cleaner that hasnt been fixed
I sent the pictures and you finally offered me to send back the items for which I paid 1305  and you said you would pay me back for the bags and 5 for the return post
At the same time I had asked you for the right hose which I ordered It was more expensive so I had to pay an extra 1150 which I did
So far so more than a month later I still havent received the appropriate hoseyou have received the items back paid the bags and 5and theres still no news from the replaced hoseI sent you a mail you replied it last Friday saying you forwarded my message to the financial departmentand since thenno hose no answer to my question when will I receive it or morewill I receive it
If I dont get the hose by Thursday Ill be more than happy to leave a comment on your site with the whole story
Ive been more than patient
We are now Thursday and I still havent had any reply nor have I received the hoseunacceptable 
Booked a hotel with them they said that all charges are included Charged me extra 3 for hotel tax When I went there the hotel said they will charge me tax again Contacted Agoda when I came back and they havent responded and just closed the ticket Also declined my cashback from quidco Really unhappy at this point
We bought a Bree plush mattress it had a hole in the box spring the stiching was awful and was not plush We took it back to the store to upgrade as we could not get our money back The sales man said we can upgrade to a more expensive soft plush mattress We paid more money Before leaving the store I looked at the new mattess which was still in the plastic to make sure no holes and the stitching was good When we got it home we took it out of the plastic set it up and again it was hard not soft not plush The product in the store is NOT what we brought home Very dissapointed We will never buy from this store again nor recommend this store to anyoneUPDATEwe were told the manager of the Lawton Home Zone store would contact us that daythey never didwe want our money back at this point we want to speak to the regional manager Alli that responded to our complaint The Lawton store has all my information to contact me asap
We carefully compared the rental car with the cheaper option that had car insurance but to our surprise we ended up paying 16 a day for insurance And that was only for 100 cover Rediculous
the description of the items is irritating i was thinking to order a set of dumbbells but got only one
Ive placed order Ambre nuit  three times and I received the confirmation emails but always after one day you sent me a cancellation email with no reason I used different cards and emails but it didnt work and I sent an email to the costumer service asking them about the reason thats behind the cancellation but I didnt get reasonable answer Im frustrated because I can not buy my best perfume because we dont have stores in my city that sell La Collection Prive  Ambre Nuit and I cant trust any online website except Dior website
Best
I received stuff i did not order and have not received what i paid 150000 for
Painfully went over simple details for order and importance of delivery time In every aspect of order there were problems Customer service was nonexistent Hung up on multiple times and placed on hold often Customer service rep flat out said  yes I am double talking to you and lying This order was for a funeral so once wrong and with refusing to correct the issue it was just a lot of money for more stress This was listed as a local mom and pop shop Its nothing of the sort Never never never again
Sold me a faulty battery  measured 122V when sold  I now know it should be 126V 122V is a close to dead  they told me that 122V was good Once I had tried it in the car and found it to be bad they refused to refund and have not responded to emails
Great price for where we wanted to stay but never actually booked the room for us Travel Republic were a disaster They sent me the confirmation email and debited my account the day I booked and so I thought happy days However when we got to the hotel there was no booking for us not even on Travel Republics database Luckily the hotel staff were amazing and sorted us out despite not receiving the money I had been debited Very disappointing service and although the price is good the reliability is just not there Not exactly what you want when it comes to something as important as your accommodation
Product does not work as advertised To expensive Not worth it
I would not buy again
Purchased small RC Drone and it was defective out of the box Can get no response to emails Will have to write this one off and learn from the experience but heed my warning youre on your own when dealing with this company
They rake customer with high markup on there parts
I fell for their scam deal they had on Facebook awhile ago and they signed me up to become a member This entails them automatically taking money out of my account if I do not go into their website and skip the month They take out 4995 USD which calculates to approx 70 AUD on a good month something which I cannot afford when I forget to skip the month however they do not offer refunds on this The only way to cancel this membership is to call them something which I havent gotten around to due to time constraints On top of this they also charge 995 USD for shipping
Well as with almost every bad review Ive read my issue was also with not purchasing the shipping insurance order never arrived shipping from china yada yada yada So if so many people have so many issues with NEVER receiving orders and dresslily is only refunding HALF of the order price of ALL these people imagine how much money theyre making off of shipped orders that magically just NEVER arrive anywhere Im sure that DressLily will respond to this negative rating and remind me that I did not purchase the shipping insurance which is fine honestly I dont even remember it being an option when I checked out so they couldnt have made that big of a deal about making sure I knew it was offered and what the consequences would be if I didnt get it There is ZERO thought put into the people responding to you The only thing they use are form letters I guess when you have probably 100s of complaint emails you have to respond to everyday form letters are just easier
I have used Shipito on two previous occasions and never had any trouble I ordered some goods to be shipped to Australia which were allegedly sent The carrier has no record of the shipment and Shipito advised that the goods have been returned and I need to pay again to get them sent I have lodged a formal complaint against this business If only I had read the reviews first No goods and out of pocket Absolute scammers Dont waste your money
Towel was full of manufacture flaws when arrived Tried to call customer service they wont answer or callback instead they email Then they ask for a bunch of photos I sent them Then they ask for more photos for their developers apparently because they question that it could be their towel CS took no responsibility and offered no remedy I then chose the return process which was buggy and ultimately generated a USPS label Bottomline I gave this company a chance and they totally failed on all fronts I will be letting my network of 5000 friends know
I placed my order over a week ago and it has still not been purchased by us go buy This is for my wedding in two weeks Terrible customer service no one answers the phone no one replies to emails chat function doesnt work Order number B1170130055890449
The website kept crashing I wasnt able to complete the order on my phone and even when I pulled it up on my laptop it gave me issues
It only gives you 1 hour to take advantage of the 2 leggings for 24 offer and I spent almost half that time dealing with the crashing website It was extremely frustrating
Car offered as no damage but inspection identified multiple damage points Post return charged 550 for windshield damage which I did not consider was there when car returned
ordered a product in December after sending an email I was told it would arrive in a few days after waiting 2 weeks I sent another email and was told it would come in 2 weeks I then sent an email requesting cancellation after 2 weeks and received no response I then had to go thru paypal to get a refund
i have been a member for a long time  My server is down now for 25 hours i have tried support tickets no reply  i tried facebook just got them to lie to me saying oh we are reviewing your ticket now  guess what nothing still 24 hours later no reply no fix server down and i paid for it 
bottom line there customer support is SLOW SLOW SLOW SLOW 
They disabled my account because I had returned a large bulk order of foodtreatsbully sticks Primal Freeze dried thats 30 a bag of 14 oz and we all know bully sticks are ridiculously expensive in bulk We found out my 7 month old dog is allergic too After saying they wouldnt fill any of my orders anymore I proceeded to say because my dog is allergic to the food I purchased Really The manager on the phone just kept repeating some text book response not even caring that the return was because the food made my dog sick Pretty messed up Wont be shopping here anymore since they disabled my account and because their 100 return policy is bogus Thanks for nothing chewycom and for making it even harder to purchase food my dog can actually eat and isnt ALLERGIC too
Hello this is not the first time to buy sunglasses from yours I had too many experiences before I think u have my history just received my doir sunglasses and also faces same issue i had before I think this issue is only with Dior the sunglasses is unbalanced and twisted I had one before and has the same issue and also send an email for this just received apologizes and we will take care next time happened the same
I suspect all the good reviews for this site are written by there own people They take no responsibility for the rental car companies they refer the customer to and I was given a car that was not even the size I had reserved much less the actual car yet I paid the amount Quote d for the smaller car Garbage is the best word for both this site and Budget the company who doesnt even honor their reservations
From the time i got the pricing back I thought it was a fairly good deal until the last button click and then saw I was not traveling one day it was in fact two Then the frustration of the stays does not afford an opportunity to change easily or contact a staff member without headaches beyond belief
The carrier Iberia and Iberia express gave a less than satisfactory experiences on many points It had three service staff members that were the saving grace for the lack luster performance and service from the other staff like no tomorrow
The lack of knowledge for a service that is offered on the airline makes the choice of the air carrier nauseating Not being able to reach anyone with the carrier or the travel booking made it a nightmare on return
I have had far better bookings with Opodo and better heads up on the actual time line before hitting the purchase button But I will blame this error on myself for not paying closer attention to the fine print though on review the timeline was not clear from 1 day really should read  2 days
Other Couriers always let me me know by email and text re time of delivery I had no idea of the timing of my delivery which is unacceptable and most disappointing My email to Customer Services enquiring as to time of delivery was also ignored Overall a disappointing experience when compared to the professionalism and efficiency of a Company like Scottsdale
We fell in love with the display in the store and after making the decision to purchase we found out that it will take weeks after we were promised In the middle of making the sales rep we were switched over to anther rep at the store When one promised us one thing we couldnt find him when we were ready to check out so we had to wait until the manager got involved We were told it would be at my home in a couple of weeks but it was pushed off several more weeks because the information they had told us in the beginning was incorrect at first When finally giving us a date and time they came hours after promised however the people were really nice separate company A few weeks after we had the bed my husband noticed that a part of our bed was a different color I called Nebraska and they sent me over to the warranty team just to be turned around again This was after many phone calls many hours spent trying to get a hold of the correct department and dont forget several unanswered emails They had a technician come out and they wrote that they didnt see a difference When he was taking pictures I advised him that you cant really see it through the camera because its so close in color Called back to get another tech out and again took pictures Which made no sense to me because I told them that they cant see it with the flash So when waking up one morning I noticed that I could get a clear shot of the different colors and did just that I sent them the photos and they said that they would replace it out of courtesy for 71 I disagree They said its been in my home for several months I told them that this is a defect in bed not something I did and I have been trying to get this fixed for several months I am going to email everyone I can and put this on all social media sites to make sure people know what they are getting themselves into when ordering from Nebraska They also came out to look at pillows on my couch since they are falling apart and its been several weeks since Ive heard from them to replace those as well
I have requested my communication from guardsman as well warranty company where they told me to go back to Nebraska
To your response I called them again yesterday They still do not have a date that we will get our pillows or fix the couch
I had to log a ticket as have heard nothing
They now advise that item is on back order and have offered me a refund to my wallet  by this I assume they mean store credit
As I have no intention to shop with them again I need a refund they are now not answering my ticket
Never again Will report to small claims court if nothing by end of week
My 1st ever order and they sent the wrong wine Bummer now the hassle of sending back etc
Not the worst clam chowder ive had but close Campbells is better one star is the lowest offered 0 star would be more appropriate
I bought a ticket for Nick Cave at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl paid 175 for a general admission when other general admissions on the same page were 50 less There were lawn tickets and seated tickets however the ticket I purchased had a seating number G6 and so I thought I had bought a seated ticket In fact it was just a lawn ticket I paid almost 200 of the original 98 price Quite disappointed TicketMaster And when I tried to call for help I was put in line with robot that kept asking me what tickets I wanted to purchase when all I wanted was to ask a question regarding a ticket
I ordered a quadcopter for my sons Xmas I tested it a week before and found it to be defective one of the motors wasnt working I contacted Tomtop for a replacementrefund They wanted me to send them a video of the product not working for their technical team to see I then sent footage of the product not working About 4 days later I received an email saying it had been passed on to their tech team and they would contact me with a solution I still waiting after 6 weeks One of the motors on the quadcopter doesnt work All I wanted was to send it back and have a replacement sent out
I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THEM AGAIN AND WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TO THE SAME
A TERRIBLE CONSUMER EXPERIENCESTAY CLEAR OF TOMTOP
Sent wrong item I have had extreme frustration trying to get this corrected Fortunately I paid with PayPal and have filed a complaint with them Cancelled my other two orders because of this Too bad I was really looking forward to them items I ordered especially the chandelier
Packed a taxi box in Melbourne which was less than a mile from their headquarters which was shipped to the Gold Coast
Unfortunately the TaxiBox service doesnt cover the Gold Coast just the bit up to 2km from my house
Sure theres a policy and a delivery boundary but Ive never experienced a company showing such a complete lack of discretion with customer service
Other than that the process was great and my items arrived as if packed them Shame I cant give you a good score TaxiBox but you dont make sense
I recently renewed my policy here out of sheer frustration3 seperate call backs were requested and not one call was returnedi also imessage through the online port and it took two days for someone to come back to mei feel the customer service is disgraceful
Ordered a watch online was in stock so i ordered it and made payment Received Usual email confirming order and payment Got a phone call 2days later to say the watch i ordered and had paid for wasnt in stock or available online I was offered another watch I didnt want another watch so i was offered a payment refund which i received within 2 days This shopping experience was Hassle grief and a waste of my time I then found the same watch elsewhere and cheaper Wont shop with you again Poor service
have not been able to contact any human being a dresslily since receiving information on the 7th of my shipment and my order was shipped
I try to cancel order or do a modification after five minuteand was impossible BH respond next day and said sorry is to late

I booked my flight two days ago and I find the same dates of my flight for the exact itinerary for a way less cheaper more than 13500 per ticket on their website and when I try to call CSR they couldnt credit me for the difference and if I cancel my tickets I will lose about 50000 in penalty and fees even if the booking was only 2 days ago but they will  My flight 7 months away and they still couldnt credit me Never going to use them again So they can take advantage of my money but I can not take advantage of the cheaper fare Nonesense

I purchased two Tornado F5 pickleball rackets I have used mine once My wife has used hers twice Her racket is separating on one edge just about two inches from the handle Since it was in an odd place I asked her what she hit and she said just the ball Not very happy with this purchase
awsome deals
Rigged poker room rude and clueless customer service cash out on sports bet works only when paddy power feels you stand to lose
This is not what I wanted Most recipes that I have to roll to make the biscuits That is NOT what I wanted I want the recipes that I can pour in the silcone bake bones It seems like this book isnt the one I should ordered at the begining just like you people fooled me by buying this
thank you
and Im disappointed
I bought a Lenovo Helix 2 in 1 Laptop at Harvey Norman Blanchardstown with FlexiRent and as soon as I had a problem with the Laptop and brought it to Balnchardstown I struggled every time I to talk to an employee from your customer service technical help desk David your sales person was even rude when I came to ask for help I was advised that I had no rights to complain as I have missed my deadline Worrying
After a few months I had a problem with the docking of the keyboard to the screen that was a struggle I wasnt taken seriously and told that software issues are not covered with the Flexirent warranty until I called the manager He was more helpful He changed the keyboard and that worked
Now I have a problem with the input of the speaker  headphone first I was not taken seriously again that I still have warranty through my Flexirent installment plan I was told to call Flexirent to have this looked at I then I was several times told the input looks scratched as if it was dropped which actually should also have been covered by my warranty as sold to me Customer consumer right act 1984 then I was informed these are not the conditions I bought the laptop with I was then also told I should bring my speakers to the shop so Nicolae could test the input At Harvey Normans are many speakers
Nikolae your employee who handled my issue was neither helpful nor willing to listen to me as a customer I am sorry but this is not how you treat your customers I certainly cant do so at my job Your staff in Blanchardstown is not very helpful and made me as a customer feel like a fool and a liar I did not get the input repaired after all I was asked if I did back up my data because this will all be lost with the repair I had to leave this just made me speechless I wont buy anything there anymore to avoid any further aggravation or even at Harvey Normans at all for this matter
Please change the training and communication of your staff or your policies as I think this is not customer service you provide in Balanchardstown at all
Due to bad experience I want to refund my order

I paid for a service in Envato Studio through Paypal but I dont get my service for a system bug I asked for a refund or to check the problem in their system without any reply
Received a pair of sunglasses that I purchased and the condition of the sunglasses were horrible Im unsure if Otticanet did not do a proper job inspecting the condition before putting in the inventory or if these were returned by another buyer but its unacceptable The sunglasses had scratches dirt oil and residue ew on the sunglass arms nose bridge area and also on the part where the screw and hinge meet for the arms After attempting to try to clean them there were still areas that were damaged and unacceptable After trying to contact their customer service their reply was that these were authentic sunglasses and to try to clean with water Sadly this was a horrible experience from Occticanet as I had high hopes when trying to find a reputable online sunglass retailer
Hidden costs
Had cables installed with your product a few years ago I needed to replace a cable It is no longer supported I now have to purchase 80 worth of cables due to the change I had to place 2 orders and wait more than 2 weeks to get this cable problem fixed
I ordered 4 days ago I got a strange call from some dude saying your order has shipped  and laughed So Im not sure what to think
Rubber washers or some other means should be supplied to prevent the tightened screw coming loose when picked for installation
not worth of money
Was told space for car was an enclosed space with an outside access door Email to sign lease stated outside not what I asked for
I would recommend not using this company for many reasons They set up a trip for my wife and myself for a 10 day trip to Patagonia The screwed up the itinerary and I had to pay for the changes They also switched us to a hotel that was 1000 USD cheaper and didnt refund the difference They said that the hotel EOLO didnt refund the money  I contacted the hotel and they said that wasnt true They are not honorable Stay away
Dear all
After 1 order which probably was ok I started getting a lot of mails
They give the possibility to unsubscribe But after 10 attempts at doing that and still getting these unwanted mails pushing their products I googled like you now probably did And yes for many years they have been spamming customers and no one can get them to stop I found this one single email address just put aff in front of the atsign before miniinthebox dot com
I started forwarding all mails from them to this address asking to be taken of their distribution list It seems to have worked Now 40 days since their last mail
Be my guest I invite you to spam them back each time they spam you
We can not agree with charges you have done and we are not sure if we want to use Goldcar offers in the future
We did few pictures before we got Ford at Gran Canaria airport and started to use it First of all the scratches
Car was full of scratches it was marked in the contract when we received it and we have paper from Goldcar where it is marked Unfortunately we could not come back to the office to change the car as we had three small kids under 4 years old with us When we returned car daytime 1130  person who received it had no complains about car condition and accepted it
We used car only for going tofrom airport supermarket and back to hotel Car was most of the time parked on the IFA Buenaventura hotel parking
There was no hurricane or other bad weather conditions that could add any scratches to the roof So we suppose that this scratches were there already when we got Ford at the airport
From the pictures you have sent to us we can not see that this is roof or the roof of exactly this car It can be any place of the car or any other car as well
We would like to get whole deposit back as we have not done any damage to this car
I have bought a bunk bed two level bed on Jan 10th at Emob website The delivery time is stated as 38 days Today is Feb 14th more than 30 DAYS LATER and there is no bed in my house yet and no expected delivery date from the transportation company
It feels Emob takes NO RESPONSIBILITY for the transportation and delivery They only blame Hermes for an apparent system failure That has taken more than 15 days and I still have no idea when I will receive the bed What a joke Im starting to think this site is a complete scam and will look into where I can report it Especially if I dont see this review posted in their website
Below is a detail description of the facts
After many calls to Emob client service number only on Jan 27 I got an email saying It was on its way After that more than 10 days went by without hearing from Emob nor from the transportation company Hermes I then contacted Emob several times by email and phone and the only thing they said was that the transportation company was going to call me In one of the emails they even said they kindly asked the transportation company to call me the next day and I got no call from Hermes of course Two days later I finally got a call from Hermes saying the bed would be delivered on the following Monday between 131800 Guess what Today is Thursday midday and no bed has been delivered and no call from Hermes to reschedule the delivery
Euroflorist did not deliver the flowers that I ordered and they did not contact me They tried to keep the money though
I would give them 0 stars but the review site seems to have 1 star as the minimum
For our honeymoon and our joint 31st birthday myself and my husband used Agoda to book the Hippo Boutique Hotel in Cape Town We arrived at the hotel to be checked in and shown a map of the local area by the receptionist We were then told Agoda had by technical fault utterly messed up our booking of a luxury suite by double booking it and that we had a standard room for tonight but no other solution moving forward The hotel said it had tried calling Agoda to obtain our contact details for a week and hadnt been able to receive any response whatsoever Having gotten a representative on the phone from Agoda I had to manage Agoda speaking with the hotel to understand what on earth had gone wrong and why we had been allowed to arrive in Cape Town at the hotel and find that we had a room for one night only having paid in excess of 850 for a 6 night stay and a luxury suite
We decided to accepted Agodas apparent alternative equivalent hotel checking into the Protea Ice and Fire where we were placed in a room so small we were unable to properly open our suitcases Please keep in mind while you read this this was our honeymoon We ended up in a bar at 10pm at night desperately trying to find accommodation for the rest of our stay
When we checked out of Protea we were told we owed both car parking and tourist levies if we wanted breakfast we had to pay for that too  which we paid for out of our own pocket above the fee already paid to Agoda The Hippo Boutique Hotel we originally checked into had both parking and breakfast included This was no equivalent
When we complained we were told we could receive a full refund we had booked a different hotel on a credit card and so requested the refund to be made to this card to cover the outgoing costs of the hotel we had just booked The representative on the phone said this was no problem at all and took the full details down They screwed this up to sending the refund back to a different card and utterly messing up our finances
All the while we were in South Africa on British mobile phones calling Hong Kong to get this issue sorted We have yet to receive our phone bills from this but Agoda will be receiving our invoice for those costs as well as the parking and tourist levy
Whilst the representatives we have spoken to have been patient they fundamentally didnt understand what we had booked into and how their alternative wasnt acceptable They have then cost us further expense as well as causing us to be in a financial situation that is outside of our control and will take us several months to recover from At this stage I havnt mentioned the emotional distress of arriving in a foreign country a new city on your honeymoon and being told the hotel you had booked into were so excited to arrive wasnt available the staff member on the desk at Hippo Boutique Hotel went so far as to say that the couple of were staying in the suite we had booked had paid double what we had  we were effectively penalised by having secured a good deal through Agoda We are still none the wiser as to how this happened nor have we receive a formal apology or compensation from Agoda We are considering our legal position and will be taking action to retrieve costs and damages
Do not use Agoda it is a shambles of a company that doesnt care about the holiday you have worked hard to earn and enjoy
My car was in with Renault main dealership in Tallaght for its bi annual service Renault needed to kep my car over the weekend as they were waiting on a part They provided me with a car and routinely rang AIG who appear as Insurers on my insurance disc Shortly after that my husband gets a call from its for women to listen to a lecture from the its for women rep that the dealer cannot transfer insurance and my husband or I would need to go online to do this This was at 5pm on a Friday evening Thankfully I was not the person waiting at the garage and thankfully our four kids were not with my husband I transfered the insurance that evening online I was charged 20euro eventhough I did the work and not the company I have 25 years of claim and penalty point free driving and this is the first time my garage have not been able to transfer my insurance to a garage car with a quick phonecall that is the custom in the Rep of Ireland Furthermore I have never been charged before by an Insurance company for arranging temporary transfer of cover I wont be renewing its for women is not in fact for me I am a full time working Mum of four and could not be botheted with this companys lecturing to me on being an online company and horrendous lack of focus on customer care Interestingly the company cannot answer your phone queries but will ring you back however choose the line they have for dealerships and they answer immediately try it I did 
Order M1701072341396571  tickets refT17021503680 T17020704352
I ordered 4 dresses carefully checking and measuring sizes 3 items were totally incorrect in size The 4th item was OK I completed the form for returns in less than 30days and received a ticket number stating details on how to return would be received within 24hours That was 6th Feb 2017 I have tried constantly to phone but the number given does not work I have tried the 24 hours Chat with Customer Service without any response I have messaged on their web page without success Quick to take my money not so quick to accept returns I imagine they will now claim I am over the 30 days 
I ordered a bunch of flowers to be delivered to my girlfriend on a Saturday and firstly received an email asking for recipient details which I gave when I placed the order I replied to this email but received another one the day before the delivery date saying that my order had been dispatched without those details and delivery couldnt be guaranteed I replied yet again with the details in question and was told theyd been forwarded to the florist On the day of delivery I received another email saying that due to logistical problems the delivery would be delayed by two days As I wasnt sure if anyone would be home on the new date and to be honest was losing all hope I asked for the order to be cancelled and refunded so I could make alternative arrangements This was agreed by email and I duly ordered another bunch of flowers from a different supplier But then as if by magic the original bunch has been delivered As happy as my girlfriend is with her flowers I really cant afford to be sending two bunches at a time so Im hoping Ill still be receiving my refund but I wont hold my breath All in all bit of a nightmare experience Id say avoid
some of the flowerrs were not fresh and had to be thrown away 1 day later
the goods delivered were not te ones ordered
a really bad experience
I tried for few days to buy a jacket with my credit card However their internal web system was rejecting the purchase not my bank their website Seriously The result of that was that they charged on my card the purchases three attempts but then they were refunding me those same purchases However they were not refunding me the whole payment They owe me like 5 bucks for each of the purchases that were refunded I contacted them about this but havent received any answer
Finally I paid with PayPal and the thing was flawless
Will I get my money back
Update I cannot reply to their reply but I can edit my own comment
They said that all three orders were refunded This is true The problem is that the money refunded does not match the money charged Funny right Not so funny after all They still owe me more than 15 euros Instead of contacting me they post this reply saying that all three orders have been refunded giving the impression that the problem has been fixed when its not true
If you want to deal with this people you have to always use PayPal otherwise their system will think that you are committing a fraud The first thing this ever happens to me Feels insulting honestly
LE SERVICE EN LUI MEME EST BON MAIS LES FLEURS LIVREES NI LE BOUQUET NE CORRESPONDAIENT PAS DU TOUT A LA COMMANDE
I ordered sunglasses on Dec 27 2016 Today is Feb 3 2017 and I still have not received any sunglasses I get an update sent to my email one time per week and it says the same thing My sunglasses have been delayed 79 more days This is nuts I already paid 180 Couldve sent then around the world 10 times in this amount of time Might be a scam Dont buy from this place
Bought a ticket for elbow in Dublin last night Was refused entry because the ticket had already been used These thieves charged 106 for a forged ticket Please be wary of this company Theyll steal your money They are uncontactable No phone No email Its a disgrace
This all sounded a good idea and although the hosts have been helpful trying to book has been very stressful as it wont let you enter the correct no of guests  Ive managed to book 2 guests but Im still not able to make it 4 as required  Im just hoping that the host can sort it 
I was excited to get the shoes They were so pretty I let my son wear them 3 times to a store with me and he has not ran nor played in these and they are already broke the sole of the shoe is falling out they are poorly made
I have had the worst customer service from apple to the point I will changing from my iPhones and never use them again I will not be patronised by a kid so full of his own importance and couldnt even be bothered to stop using his iPad and actually talk to me directly They were very rude This is the apple shop in blue water
Long lead time no clear estimation of the lead time No clear status update of the order it only mentions paid and no idea when they expect to be able to deliver
Delivery and order status information needs to be improved
Someone at there end added a number that was wrong to my part They sent wrong part now waiting to see if they if issue The difference between a four star and a one Well see what happens now
I prepaid 45658 to RentalCarscom to reserve a car for 8 days in Cancun When I arrived at Budget they stated that the insurance was not sufficient and if I wanted to use the Rental Carscom reservation I had to post a 50 deposit for the full value of the car  over 10000 I was at the desk with my family for over one hour trying to convince them that I had a valid prepaid reservation Instead to get a car I created an entirely new reservation through Budget for nearly 700 with full insurance coverage No credit was given to me for the money I paid to Rental Carscom Rentalcarscom referred me to American Express to make a claim Im out 45658 Dont use these guys
You have not called me for my Visa information nor have you responded to my query of whether I purchased the Gibney sauce ladle or if that other person who had already put the item in hisher cart got it first So without further information I have no means of rating you unlike the other silversmith I dealt with earlier this week
I asked for specific delivery option and if they could not do so they should cancel the order After shipment i got a note that they could not change anything because the parcel was sent this note several days after purchase second message was that i should have wrote a note along to the orderWHAT that was excatly what i did they just didnt read it before after shipment Their error and mistake but no solution is offered i just have to accept that because of them some items to around 100 usd will end up costing an extra 89 usd because they did not at least send the items in one parcel but broke it up in bits so i have to pay 23 usd custom fee for each parcel
At another purchace I payed like 18 usd for fast delivery 2 days later it was shipped now 10 days later still no update upon the tracking and this means it has still not left the origin airport I have faster delivery from Ebay with free shipment
No matter what you write to costumer service they refuse to listen to you and it is like they do not understand English at all if you ask in east they reply in west
And bevare in Ebay you buy from different sellers and can always choose another seller in Banggood all goes thru their service center and this way you cant make any request to the seller direct and avoid misunderstandings
My advice will forever be if you shop from Asia online then avoid Banggood they are not to be trusted and their money guarantee is worthless because Banggood is seller and judge in all complaints
Unable to contact by telephone just go round in circles no one returns calls or answers emails I booked a 3 night break on 9th Jan money was taken and confirmation email received 1 hour later email arrives to say hotel is full and they have cancelled my booking but I will receive a full refund I am still waiting have sent 3 emails no response telephoned 5 times no response am now going to seek legal advice would not consider a holiday with this company under any circumstances

Airtasker doesnt confirm with people requiring the job done if the job was actually completed they release funds without checking Allows scammers to be on the page and steal our money I assigned someone for a job as this person updated details as he had completed the job 1 minute after which is not true and has declined my request to cancel Why should he receive my money when he did nothing Spreading the word with everyone and everywhere Dont use this service

I paid for 3 different game codes via Paypal in one transaction the money was taken instantly However I didnt receive any communication from Gamesdeal not even an order confirmation I have sent two emails one via PayPal and one via the customer service option on their website but still nothing I am sure my funds will be replaced as I paid through PayPal but I would advise you to use caution when dealing with this company from my recent experience
I would put a 0 star if this was possible In reality we choose Thalys because this is the only existing option to transit between Amsterdam and Paris and there is no existing competition from Ryanair or Easy jet YET
Besides being highly pricy the trains run in an unorganised way from Amsterdam central or Schiphol Meaning no clear display of the platform until 5min before it arrives and I am generous here No Thalys staff to guide you either For example today my train overall stayed 1 min on the platform for a 16h34 schedule from Schiphol to Paris and I missed this 135 euros train today like that Less than 1 min later it was not displayed anymore and other intercity trains ran on the platform I had hope that the controller for the next train could have some pity as i was told at the Thalys counterbut he made me pay 124 euros for the same trip
Trip where I have no seat assigned and on my receipt it just says no ticket Like an outcast that fraud to be on this 0 star train I am pretty angry and disappointed of the lack of compassion and understanding
In clear you pay 259 euros for being sat next to the door and also told that they cannot do anything for you That this is your Fault
AVOID THALYS better the car sharing having nice people respecting you 
great web site product you have i need havent received it yet you need faster turn around
After the new year the bills went up twice

Nowhere on their website did they mention any difference in shipping to Hawaii What I thought was a USPS 695 shipping charge magically turned into a 1495 charge on checkout which I didnt notice When I called them to complain they said the only way to ship to Hawaii was by Priority Mail So guess what my order came by USPS Parcel Post After arguing with their customer service for 15 minutes my case was referred to a supervisor who ended up refunding my 8 overcharge Wont be ordering from them again
I purchased an android box from them and box keep crashing so I asked them if there was any softwarefirmware that needs to be upgraded to avoid it from crashing Their responded was please send a video and well assist you further How am I supposed to know when it will crash I wouldnt buy anything from these guys
OCR has difficulty to install and function
Customer service is inexistent
If you want to ask someone you have no email address to ask any question They only care about money making
When you combine scanned pages you need to do it manually one by one The software does not recognise what you scanned You scan again and manually add again
When I ordered 3 ink converters for a fountain pen there was no indication that there would be any delay in shipping them but first the entire order was delayed by about a week then only 1 was shipped and finally the remainder of the order was shipped the following week In their defense they kept me informed through emails and also shipped the 1 item out as soon as they got it in splitting the order But nonetheless I found it a subpar experience What should happen is that the website indicates when the product will be delivered and be truthful about it failing that there should be an immediate followup email with the option to cancel the order Had I known how long it would take I probably would have jumped to a different seller
roses for Valentines day were delivered timely ok for that
the initial outlook seemed roughly acceptable
but after 1 day already the roses seemed over the top of their freshness and despite the care given to them to keep them looking well after the 2nd day they were gone completely lousy looking opened and ready for the dustbin  what a disappointment for a type of flower that when delivered fresh can keep easily about 1012 days
we will surely not recommend Euroflorist for future orders
Why dont you provide the oneway drop off fee when we make the booking

Purchased a pair of Persol sunglasses I changed my mind and decided I wanted another model so I contacted them through their website contact form and told them to cancel the order because I wanted to change the model It was over the weekend so I assumed business was closed and they would get my message on Monday Come Monday I get a notification that my order has been shipped So now I have to wait to receive an item I wanted to change and if I want to return this Ill have to pay the shipping fee I would say be absolutely sure before purchasing with these guys They dont really seem to care about customer service even though theyre website states 100 customer satisfaction guaranteed
Called two weeks prior to the reservation and cancelled Later a charge appeared on our Visa card Called the hotel and they said that cancellations can not be made Ended up paying 12500 for a room I didnt even use Never will book rooms again through third party sites

Spent hours on the phone making sure a spoiler was in stock and could be shipped promptly for my firebird A sales rep check the garage and assured me it was in stock and would ship within a few days Good deal Send my car to the garage to get painted and waited and waited and waited for my spoiler I never received a tracking number so I called to see what was up After being bounced from department to departed I was told the spoiler was on back order from the manufacture and would take 3045 days to come in So now Im screwed At this point I try to cancelled my order since it hasnt shipped and apparently wont ship anytime soon Again bounced from department to department for literally hours 2 finally I get someone who cancels my order Thank god thats over Got the email confirmation that my order was cancelled Thumbs up I leave for vacation Im not a tech savvy young buck so I dont need to check my emails on vacations 4 days later I got an email saying my order had shipped The next day I get one saying my order couldnt be cancelled bc it had already shipped from the manufacture What the absolute hell Spent all day trying to call and leave messages for Vincent the manager After another 40 mins on the phone again bounced from department to departmentone said he was off today one said he had left already for the day excuses just go on and on an employee claimed he knew this Vincent was in because he had spoken to himwhat for frickin kind of but backwards service is this I highly recommend to NEVER ORDER FROM CARID THEY ARE CROOKED AND HAVE TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE
Was with California Casualty for over 20 years When I finally had a claim not too expensive they dropped me They contacted me later and said they would continue my policy but my rates would go way up and I had to sign an agreement to limit their liability By then I had switched to AAA who was less expensive than CCs original rate and provides more service
I was very disappointed with the DiorShow mascara that I bought from Dior online While the packaging was gorgeous the mascara dried up within 2 weeks and there was very little product in the tube For the price of 30 I would have expected it to last a bit longer
We paid over 4000 for furniture and we are stIll waiting for a dresser and a recliner Since January 5 I didnt realize that assembly was jot included upon delivery I spent 3 days sleeping on the floor until I could get someone to come out and assemble my storage bed which came with missing hardware to assemble it When I phoned the store I was told I must not be doing something right No I didnt have all the parts to assemble it Still waiting for the recliner and dresser with no phone call no update nothing Id rather just get my money back
I cannot adequately summarize the sheer anger I felt at having to work so  hard to simply remove a program from my computer After hours and hours of dealing with what was a possible virus I spent hours JUST trying to remove the program as I could see in the Task Manager that processes were still running and I could not kill those processes I could not manually remove the directory
The uninstall failed 3 or more times I had to reinstall as part of the process to try and get it to uninstall properly before I gave up on that Using the control panel to try and repair the program also did not repair that the program would not uninistall
What angers me most is that Lavasoft is completely aware of the massive difficulties some have removing their program if you dont believe me just take a look at their forums and yet here it is still just about impossible to get rid of After following every instruction I could find on Lavasofts Forums and several of the standard answers being things I could not accomplish because the files referenced did not exist anywhere on my system that the system could find and each further step being more and more ridiculously involved becoming too frustrated to complete the instructions to do x y and z and return results to Lavasoft for someone to try and help me undo this completely outrageous uninstall I was livid
With overwhelming disgust I threw in the towel with respect to Lavasoft providing a fix that did not involve an unacceptable amount of work and effort on my part and after more googling I finally came upon someone on the Microsoft Forums who provided a walk through which also detailed and annoying in how many steps had to be taken to simply remove this program I had to download Malwarebytes FileAssassin THEN the instructions for keeping it from trying to reinstall everytime it turned out did NOT work completely because every single time I had to open File Explorer which was quite a bit it tried to reinstall itself AGAIN
Finally I found something via google where someone had had some success with Ccleaner in getting the program to stop doing this So now I just have the service running which does not appear to be eating up any noticeable amount of resources but thats there it ends
So in the end I was STILL unable to remove AdAware after a completely unacceptable amount of work and effort but the result appears to be near the same as long as it doesnt bother me to see it STILL on my SYSTEM when Im poking about
there are alot of typical chinese seller here theyll list one thing when you get the item its just garbage
save your time and money
Tried this as they were slightly cheaper than my usual but ended up more expensive as their shipping charge was more and they charged for the shipping material
My daughters boyfriends birthday was last week and she wanted to cook him a great lobster as he is from Maine and you cant get Maine lobster in California
I order two and as noted higher shipping and fee for material When they arrived one was dead and owner said he would refund cost of one When I insisted that was not correct He finally gave a gift certificate for 45 of shipping and one lobster and did not offer to pay for the shipping materials
I have ordered many lobsters from my usual and never had a problem and they guarantee replacement for free  including shipping
DO NOT USE THEM
Please please never trust them never buy a smartphone from them

I was very happy when I purchased my moms hospital bed Until the bed was delivered and they shipped the mattress and bed rails separate They contacted me to say the bed was on the waybut never told me the mattress and bed rails were not being delivered with the bed I tried calling express medical supply to resolve the matter and their phones were so messed up I could not hear the representative I still need to call back on Monday to see what they will do to correct the shipping issue I now must Buy a mattress until the other one comes in and hope my mom is ok without bed rails
Lots of onfo about the flour to use and why I was surprised how many different flours there are
They took twice the payment out of my daughters account and completely refused to give the money back even though my daughter informed them straight away Her only option was to resell the additional tickets they got a booking fee twice Secondly Drakes concert which she was flying to Amsterdam to see was cancelled 5 days before and again they refused to give the money back They do not respond to emails Viagogo took over 400 out of my daughters account and she receive absolutely nothing in return so far She has also found out via social media that this has happened to lots of people using this company Please be careful
This Company is incompetent and unprofessional The staff dont know company policies and will give you incorrect advice despite you trying to clarify three times They are not helpful and are unable to contact you if something has gone wrong
Furthermore when you give them feedback the response is laughable They barely address your concerns and offer you 10 off your next rental hire As if Id ever go back
 at least three groups of customers have been waiting for someone to attend for half an hour
The service was great except paying 70 pounds for moving pick up time forward 4 hours
I ordered my flowers on 29 January for Valentines Day and have not yet received them I have sent at least 5 request to their Customer Service link and I have received nothing except an automated email response asking if I was satisfied with their response I have used their company many times in the past with no problems and even great things to say but this experience is enough to turn me to another company Can I get a refund some real interaction to solve this problem something
Literally ever item I clicked on 8 items were sold out in my size I had to settle with some things that I felt average about I probably wont shop here again since the 2 for 24 expires soon Maybe it would be a different story if what I liked was in stock
I had an order over 200 I went to use the coupon it said sign in first well I was signed in oh it took my payment without me signing in which meant that I was signed in in the first place dont tease us customers with coupons you have no intention of letting us use shame on you
sometimes things go bad maybe it was not your fault but my loss robert
9 days since the shipment left USGOBUY and still in Portland They never pick up the phone reply on emails with one line where half the content is Sorry for any inconvenience Please contact us if you have any questions I have spent over 1000 USD with them and several of my friends moved to them on my recommendation It seems like I am done now with them I will look for other options where staff actually helps I asked them to refund me at least some part of the cost and they have bluntly refused to even acknowledge my question
To top up if I pay for 3  6 business days I expect them to live up to this and either refund or do something else I will now share this with those who I recommended your company too and will look for alternatives
Parcel number U20170131727128 stuck with USPS for 9 days

I purchased a vaporizer and forgot to enter my coupon code After I realized my mistake I emailed them back Instead of assisting me they quickly changed item to shipped and informed me they could not go back to a shipped order I would not shop her again
As the old saying goes you live and you learn and if you dont its like banging your head against a wall I shouldve known to check reviews before purchasing an item on getButterfly codecanyon and Envato Market but I let my guard down and bang I never got the download I paid for and worse it sends me a link which leads to an cant find server page I attempt to contact them and theres not a chat or phone customer service line just a shallow reply that the matter is being looked into Today I go back to site and theres not even a record that Im a client or record of my purchase Yes its a small loss but not worth losing valuable time The money is chump change however the experience is invaluable especially after reading the comments here I am at the least thankful that I can put this ugly episode behind me and move on People like this are petty and unethical Anyone considering doing business with Envato Market I simply sayBUYER BEWARE

Ordering was simple shipped as promised But a signature was requested upon delivery I have been waiting all day for 2 days now and as soon as I leave fed ex shows up and leaves a missed you note When I try to schedule a time with fed ex or pick up from depot fed ex wants me to open an account and leave a credit card number for billing  ALL I WANT IS MY PACKAGE
I tried to cheat the system and not have a current eye exam I went through the web site thinking that I would just enter in the information off my old prescription and not make an appointment with the eye doctor When I got to the end I realized that I was going to have to have a current prescription At this point I did not think anything about getting these contacts because it said they would not send them without this information I bit the bullet and made an appointment with the eye doctor and got an exam I used my insurance to purchase the contacts at the eye doctor with my new prescription Next thing I know I am charged for the contacts at lensdirectcom and they shipped the contacts with the old prescription I now have to figure out how to return them This is a waste of 200 at this point
Im buying everything off them good company fast shipping
To be honest they had a price of 2999 when I ordered my lenses and in 5 days they reduced the price to 1599 Upon asking the price check and adjustments they say we cannot do it
I also said can i return the old order and place the new one to which they replied that we wont reimburse the courier charges leading me lenses with twice the price
Extremely unhappy with them as I could have gone to the store and purchased for same price and walked out Im going on a 3 week wait to get a pair of glasses
Dont book with Rentalcarscom Booked twice and the system took other return times than we chose Amending bookings is not possible had to cancel and pay again but the refunds never arrived Ripoff
I AM STILL WAITING FOR MY INK
Constant spam mail sometimes multiple times per day The worst part is you cant unsubscribe Most of the time the unsubscribe link is dead and if you do get through they ignore it I dont care what kind of deals they offer this is a horrible way to treat your customers Not worth it
I had booked a car with insurence when i came to the airport he said i needed a XTRA insurence paid for NIGHT tax and they gave me the wrong car and i told them but they didnt care
The car should have costed mee 100 Euro but ended in almost 400 euro
NEVER NEVER LEASE FROM THEM
I was informed that the parcel was delivered Called my aunt to see if got her Christmas present It hadnt come she said Well to cut this short after a lot time trying to tell this company that nothing was delivered I got a email A woman called to say she had the parcel
Now I thaught we are getting somewhere They believe me As its there mistake I thaught the would have picked it up and delivered it that day O no it couldnt be done until the following day I was asked for phone numbers for contact They had my and my sisters but no one called They dont use the post code for the address Well the parcel finally reached to my aunt that evening I was relieved that she got her Christmas present just in time I was exhausted from the stress of it all and the time just days before Christmas that I could used to do things for my family
I asked to make complaint to the manager Was told that the parcel was delivered and the matter was now closed and that person was the manager
She didnt forward anything I emailed to see what was happening As you can imagine nothing for nearly 3 weeks I am very disappointed as the last contact I had I was told a manager for customer services would call me Just more wasted time waiting for a phone call This such poor customer service If I could have rated with a minuses  I would have So be warned this company feel if they deliver something for you then they are doing you a favour
I booked a car online and requested a vehicle that could cross the boarder to Chile This request was written in the confirmation email I received so I thought everything was okay to proceed I was then emailed to download an app to printout my order however I had no internet access at this time as I was in Antarctica for the 2weeks preceding the pickup of the hire car and by the time i did get access to the internet and therefore the email to download the app the download did not work I arrived at my destination to find the Avis employee with a car that COULD NOT cross the boarder from Argentina to Chile This was a very stressful situation as I had accommodation paid for in Chile and the idea of a great holiday with no way to get there There were no buses running or any other form of transport the reason I hired a car Fortunately I eventually got the Avis employee to take me into town where we finally found another rental company with a car that could cross the boarder 5 hours later 300 extra and lots of stress I managed to get a rental car
Asked to have an order sent on a rush and it was over a week late Almost ran out of my shipping supplies and had to improvise with boxes
Recently purchased OOMA Telo Air for my mother a retired seniorWorked fine at first then we ported her number from Bell Canada
Since then nothing but problems One way calls noise missed calls dropped calls calls going to voicemail instead of call waiting even with voicemail turned off My sister and I have been trying unsuccessfully for over two weeks to get this resolved We have been in touch with OOMAs service department numerous times telling them over and over what issues are being encountered
We have spent a lot of time on the phone with these technical experts and the issues remain unresolved Getting fed up with this experience and will likely change to another provider after using this crappy service for about a month Do not purchase this service It may be cheap but the experience is terrible
There are better providers out thereChris from Drumbo Ontario

Much lower offer in person than online and 240 in document fees
Ordered back on November 30th and never received the item After over a month I contacted support and they said I had to wait till Feb 8th to verify that it doesnt show up This is after a mess with them giving me a tracking number but saying there is no tracking for the item which made no sense at all I gave it the full amount of time for the item to show up but after contacting them again they are trying to blame the shipping company and want me to repay for the item or give me a coupon for another order
I would stay far away from this site I have ordered lot of things from China and never had problems like I did with sammydress
I had my iPhone 6s Plus unlocked from TMobile by unlock river Everything was fine for 5 months I then had to do restore on the phone and when I did it relocked to TMobile I contacted them right away and provided proof it was relocked to TMobile I tried all there suggestions and nothing worked I even had apple support verify I was locked to TMobile
They claimed that because the IMEI was blocked by TMobile the unlock wouldnt work the block by TMobile was done months before the unlock by unlock river was done It has nothing to do with a Att sim not working in my phone if it was truly a factory unlock The IMEI was not black listed only blocked on TMobile So I had the block removed on the IMEI and the of course the phone was still locked and would not work on ATT Unlock river responded by saying it was still blocked by TMobile  completely false  I have asked 78 to just unlock the phone again per there guarantee They will not do so Now they have ignored me hoping I go away and appear to have no intention of living up to there permanent unlock guarantee They havent even given my money back They do not provide permanent factory unlock as claimed They provide some kind of half as unlock hack that is removed with a restore Do not use them
I will never book again a flight on Flighthub When I chose my flight with my friend the ticket was for 280 so we booked it very fast because it seems to be the cheapest flight we found When we confirm the flight for 280 we got a bill of 390 I called the costumer service and they couldnt even help even if they knew that they made a mistake they didnt even really care for my problem They told me that I have to options I could cancel this flight and still needed to pay 75 and should book again the same flight for 315 This didnt made sense for me so by the end I should pay more than I actually already did And by the way the costumer service didnt tell me at the beginning that I would need to pay for the cancelation after I asked a lot of times he told me the price There are a lot of hidden prices they dont tell you about And my other option was just to take my flight This is the last time for me and my friends booking a flight on flighthub we were about to book the hotel and to rent a car on flighthub too but not after all of this You can NOT trust flighthub
The guy told me that its a mistake from the airline that i booked so I should call delta airline Even the guy from delta airline couldnt believe how this guy from flighthub workes and that its definetly a mistake from flighthub since I booked the flight from theire homepage I cant believe that you guys cant even help your costumer after you made mistakes and trying to tell me that it would be the fault of someone else
I returned the car at AutoClick Alicante office on 12102016 according to the rental agreement There was a parking accident with a small damages on the car I applied the papers about the accident to start the procedure to recovery at the same office before to return the car on 11102016
My credit card is charged with 1013 euro on 13102016 Still this amount is missing from the credit card more than 3 moths
It is apparent that everything is in order about the insurance to recover the damage
All the details are available at the Police station Valencia
It took my daughter 3 wks two trips to our local DMV two phone calls to your place of business idrivesafely i was hung up on the second time and a call to Tallahassee to get her learners permit Now that is just horrible But when my credit card was entered the funds were immediately withdrawn but we had to go through all of this foolishness to get her permit I told the DMV to find another company to handle their classes this company is ridiculous

I picked a psychic yesterday next to her profile a discount rate of 4 was listed Yet I was charged 790 a minute I disputed this yet the say the charges are correct Not impressed Also it seems that their minutes seem to click over quickly It would be nice if they had a minute counter on screen so that the client knows how long that they have been in chat
Ive rented three times from Goldcar once in Alicante in Spain then in Venice then in Malta All three times there were problems
The rental in Spain was the worst The day after I picked up the car I drove to Murcia and less than an hour after I parked the car vanished without a trace In spite of paying for full coverage insurance and being assured that the theft was covered when they found the car two months later miles from where Id parked I was told that the insurance wouldnt cover it because the police couldnt prove the car had been stolen They put the onus on me to prove I hadnt been where the car had been found They said I had to pay a 1500 fine to cover the time the car was out of service or else theyd press charges I balked at first but then knowing that court proceedings were impractical since I didnt live there and not wanting to be banned from Spain if I ignored it I talked them down to an 800 fine I still dont know what happened to the car but given that Goldcar has an office in Murcia and there was reportedly no damage to the vehicle and almost all my things were still inside I wouldnt be surprised if it were an inside job but only God knows for sure Suffice it to say the insurance which doubled the cost of the rental was worthless Between the rental cost the fine and the extra return flight to pick up my things it cost me well over 1000 for a single day of driving
I later rented in Venice and it was also a debacle but for different reasons They tried to push the full coverage insurance on me saying if you dont take it youll be sorry really honest that but the rates were outrageous roughly double the rental price so I refused it figuring from my previous experience that it wasnt good for much anyway At this point they went to take the deposit and proceeded to tell me they wouldnt accept any credit card that wasnt a chipandpin they wouldnt take any AmEx and they wouldnt take a debit card Suddenly I found I had no way to pay But they said if I took the full coverage then they could charge that to any card Ha  what a coincidence In the end I paid it since it was summertime and the competition was completely sold out The trip and return went fine but what a ripoff
My latest experience was in Malta with Rhodium Goldcars premium brand it turns out and fortunately it was somewhat better than the previous experiences They didnt try to force the full coverage insurance on me but they did advise that the deposit would be held for 30 days why so long I was also charged a separate 50 outofhours fee which wasnt included in the rate Id booked and wasnt mentioned anywhere in the reservation documentation The car itself had filthy windows the low tire pressure light was on for all 4 tires and it acted like it was about to stall in spite of not having very many miles on it The maintenance standard certainly left something to be desired
Disgraceful service waited almost 2 weeks for nothing to arrive Have asked for a refund more than 6 times as nothing had been sent eventually they tell me its been half shipped but wont give a tracking number Then after asking again and again for a refund a tracking number is provided and only booked in 30 mins after my last email again asking for a refund Absolutely disgraceful and still they wont cancel my order and refund even though they have not sent it out I have emailed a complaint to trading standards and paypal and see what happens now with that to whether or not i get my refund or told just more fabricated stories What a disgraceful company indeed I am very upset and will continue to post my reviews on these sites for other buyers to beware of the problems of getting a refund if needed only word is disgraceful
I had 4 walls that needed mays I gave the measurements of the walls and the height There were multiple mats per wall the mats came I ordered 4 ft high these were 5ft high then there was no set up as to which pads went with the wall measurements I gave
Due to a train crash on our route we were taken back to a previous station and left to find or own way to Brussels No one was helpful and the route suggested to us was an extra 2 hours out of the way Apparently that was the only alternate route given to everyone else because each train departing on that route was packed full of masses of people which didnt feel safe at all and we missed the next two trains because of the overflow of people trying to squish themselves onto a tiny train We spent 6 hours at the Liege train station trying to figure out how to get to our destination No one was apologetic about this and we received no offer for any sort of refund
The biggest scam on this earth Paddy Power has an offer where if you palce 50 tennis bets in a week you get one free bet of the average stake upon 250 pounds This week on Sunday i had 47 tennis bets i had to place 3 more i had one in play which was suppoed to be voided At 1025 Pm i went on chat talking with Alan telling hime that i need the bet to be settled so i can place my money on something else I talked with him on lenght and he wasnt able to help me I dont even know why they have customer service I was not able to place the last 3 bets until 2359 so all my work was for nothing and all because of how bad this company it is Basicaly when you are close to get 50 bets they stop settling your bets so you dont get the bonus So they do whatever they want with you
I feel that 556 dollars is too much money to file for my income tax since I got a rapid refund on top of that I have to give back 100 dollars I have wanted a month and 2 weeks I feel that the balance due should be reduced to more of a reasonable amount
Arrived for car and given a higher price a hard sell on supplementary insurance products a totally unreasonable contract and forced to pay for a full tank of fuel in advance Easirent stinks and shouldnt be on the Car Hire Labs list of providers

Very disappointed will be moving supplier
I ordered a pair of Schwalbe PRO ONE tyres and fitted them as per the instructions i spent the best part of a wee trying to fit them until i gave up and took them along with the wheels to my local bike shop The bead on both tyres was not finished properly which was the reason why the tyres would not seat Both the bike shop and i tried to contact the UK customer service but were always placed in a queing system I gave up and threw the tyres and have now fitted alternatives which inflated as per the instructions The product may be cheaper but if it is not fit for purpose then it is money down the drain regrettably I cannot recommend Mantel as i was unable to speak to customer service if there is such a service for the UK I dont know if there is as neither i nor the bike shop could get hold of anyone
The house where we stayed was wonderful but vacation rental pros was very difficult to deal with I had trouble reaching them on multiple occasions and getting answers to questions was nearly impossible
The products are excellent and returnable if you dont like them
I signed up for something that was supposed to be a gift certificate for a buying club but never got anything
They are good on communicating but take a long time to deliver Took 15 days to get my glasses
This restaurant should be taken off any Home Delivery service After 2 hours of constant phone calls only to be hung up on and told they were to busy no delivery arrived Spoke to Don at EatNow and have requested a full refund to actioned immediately Not a very pleasant experience Will be going down to the Restaurant to see the Owner Manager to report their lack of Customer Service and would love to see Staff member sacked
The car the gave us was dirty it had a hole in the partners seat it was in a very bad condition We paid for TPL and when we arrived here Avis told us that insurance does not exist We had to pay again for the insurance Terrible terrible
I accepted their offer and terms which included 50 deposit for a trip more than 60 days away It was accepted and I received a receipt They came back and said their page was wrong and that 100 payment must be sent immediately or theyd cancel the reservation
VERY unhappy that you cant even trust what they put in writing
The worst experience I have ever had The ticket master was very rude and impolite I along with my cousins we were heading to food bar to have some coffee and sandwiches but on the way one of the ticket master asked for our tickets which is fine but when we said we got tickets but we have left it in our seats he replied to us syaing that we need tickets and you should go and get back the tickets or you should carry your seats Carry your seats That doesnt even make sense The ticket master was very rude and he seemed to have a very unpleasant behaviour Never going to travel with Thayls again
I ordered a mobilephone on 26th Jan but I have had no update regarding this order I have sent multiple emails but no response from them Even the online chat does not work Not impressed

94 individual readers within 13 months and 17000 later
Ive discovered several Kasamba readers operating Multiple accounts on Kasamba and or sharing scripts with the exact grammatical errors The findings reported to Kasamba resulted in those readers continuing to operate their accounts although some have since changed screen names Several Kasamba readers can also be found operating multi accounts on other websites such as keen psychicscom bitwine etcIt doesnt take a Psychic to determine what a person needs to hear based upon the question asked Ive awarded Five stars to all 94 Psychics for their OUTSTANDING story telling abilities Telling me what I needed to hear at the moment pushing back time frames when questioned about why predictions werent coming to pass and or why predictions were changing The ratings are a real joke Youre given up to 30 days
to rate each paid session before the timer expires Most given predictions are further than 30 days away A more customer friendly option is the ability to rate the reading after the prediction comes to fruition or allowing the timer to remain open until the customer chooses
to rate Kasambas ratings would then be awful which is why this option doesnt exist The customer is inconvenienced by purchasing another reading from the advisor wishing to rate after the initial rating
Who is willing to pay to question why the original prediction didnt come to pass So us hopeless individuals move on with life kicking ourselves for using these sites in the first place Did I mention the One star ratings Ive given that didnt get posted 
13 months hoping against hope for months as I couldnt understand why my situation was getting worse while the readers were telling me it was slowly getting better to hold on for sure Id see positive
changes next month and next month and ugghhhh
In Finale Kasamba prevented me from burdening my friends  family with tears by providing a wonderful opportunity for me to deplete my finances desperately seeking true spiritual guidance and direction for my failing marriage  the stability my children once knew
No longer in confusion I recommend anyone seeking real spiritual guidance order and direction to lean SOLELY on the ONE that created you  gives you daily breath For only Your Creator knows the true honest just and pure plans for each area of your life AND it wont cost you nothing more than your time
REMEMBER FOR YOUR ENTERTAINMENT ONLY
UPDATE 22217
ZVI your pay must be grrrreat
Take the time to REREVIEW my account THOROUGHLY  YOU WILL FIND case file 25243 unless thats just as bogus as your readers Philip ZUCO using this trustpilot to give your company 5 star ratings
I reported PSYCHIC VISION BY MEHR  LIGHT FOR TRUTH for giving me the same exact reading with exact grammatical errors I sent a complaint and asked if Kasamba provides auto generated scripts  responses for their readers or if these two readers are in fact the same person
AMY from the ABUSE department responded stating the following
Hi Thank you for informing us of this matter
I would like to assure you that after looing into the matter action has been taken with this member Please be aware that we are doing are best to prevent any such cases however occasionally a member can fall through the cracks We will continue to do the utmost to prevent any future occurrence of this nature We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience
Sincerely

Abuse Department
My reply to Amy informed her that the vague response left me feeling uncomfortable and lacked confidence in the reading it was completely fake I asked for a complete explanation as to what took place  how this reader was able to operate two accounts I received nothing I continued to send complaints to Kasamba about that reader in addition to others CS Rep Rotem finally responded asking me to send the session s 33549635  335494216 for the first reader because
I didnt give Kasamba enough details for an investigation I sent him the session numbers and NEVER HEARD ANYTHING TO DATE This reader as well as the others are still operating multiple accounts
RATINGS What a coincidence that I rated EUPHRATES ARSANIAS on Jan 8 2017 and it just appeared in his post Early this Feb 22 2017 morning Its obvious that you made that adjustment upon reading my trustpilot message while Good ratings post immediately
Kasamba had no intention on posting this rating nor any others
Rectify the situation by returning 17000 back to my credit cards you have on file Meanwhile screen your readers rescreen them frequently and revamp your rating system Also be compassionate for those hurting and coming to your site for help
You should also do a thorough account review before responding to a customers complaints I have the emails and have printed each reading to prove everything that Im stating
Its been embarrassing providing this post as its my fault for spending my time and money The post became necessary when another reader contacted me days ago for an UPDATE yet she gave me the same UPDATE that shes been giving me for monthsUPDATED BS I spent 60 letting her know that she was full of BS and I didnt bother rating her because you havent posted my other bad ratings until today
I gave an honest review of Kasamba here on Trustpilot omitting the names of your readers In your attempt to politely blast me for not contacting Kasamba with my SEVERE ACCUSATIONS a few names needed to be released Come at me incorrect once again and Ill be happy to post my readers list so that everyone will know whos the best at story telling and whos not
Emails after emails not returned blinds took weeks to arrive was charged twice for postage when half order was placed on hold so as all went together but then never did due to thier error
Car was fine for what we needed  so cant complain there
It all started when we rang the hotline to arrange pick up from the airport that then takes you to the depot to pick up your car To our surprise they had taken us to another depot Which as tourists we didnt know where we were or where we were meant to be we gave them our names and said we were collecting a car that we had booked
As we arrived at the depot we were mucked around by one of your staff who didnt listen to what we were saying and confused us made us pay for an extra days rental before another guy stepped in and corrected her and refunded us the money we didnt need to pay
We then were given the keys and GPS and taken out to the car I then asked the man if he could help us install the GPS which he replied you are going to have to figure it out for yourself at some stage
Overall experience with the car was fine The customer service on the other hand was beyond terrible Not the way we wanted to start our travels in NZ
We were made to feel stupid and more of a hassle than a customer who is supporting this business
All we got from this experience was rude comments like well youve really bugged this up you are going to have to figure this out for yourself at some stage And to be spoken to rudely and abruptly and not listened to
I had only head great things about NZ and recommended your car rental by several people before choosing to book with you I guess I just feel very disappointed by the experience
Price too high
Although their customer service team respond the same day to your mail this is the only on time thing about this company Having ordered an item well over one month ago Ive still not received my item to even assess the quality I have told them repeatedly in no longer need or want the item and have made multiple requests and demands for a refund but they appear unwilling to give me my money back For reference my order number DLN619G0V
SAVRAL TIME I PLACE THE ORDER BUT NAVER ET DELIVERY ON TIME
We paid in full and they refused to finish the job and we had to hire a different company to finish the job They use eccuses and even will threaten to sue you We do not recommend them
I purchased the heater on the 27th of January and never received any information until two weeks after the purchase I was charged for the purchase three days after buying it It appears as if it will take close to a month before I receive the item I ordered I would not recommend purchasing from them
Hi
Last night 24 JAN 2017 around 0215 hrs at Goldcar office in Malaga Airport secure area I received the keys and paid for the car mentioned in contract 11029304
I was informed that if the car had more dentsdamagescratches shown on the received drawingsketch I should take a photo to document that the damage was on the car before I received it
When I got to the car outside the secure area around 0220 hrs did I find that the car had many more dentsscratches than shown on the received documents I took the attached photos and marked it on the attached drawingsketch to document it
Today I went back to the airport 30 minutes drive in order to rectify the lease documentation but I was meet by a very aggressive middleaged male Goldcar office person refusing to rectify the documents or to inform me of what to do he repeatedly stated that I should have gone back to the office inside the airport secure area when I replied that it is impossible to reenter the airport secure area he then refused to talk to me and turned his back to me and walked away I find this kind of reply and behavior very rude
I dont intend to waste more of my time please let me know what to do as I do not intend to be responsible for the mentioned damagesdentsscratches
I am facing alot of problem
Hi
Agodas service has decreased a lot lately I have been using them untill now but will choose expedia from now on I have been told lot of times that i would get a 10 discount on my next booking because of an error But nothing has happened They just let it go And i lately booked a hotelroom which was about 200kr more expensive than the same room they had right under my booking I told them and they said i would get compensation if i screenshotted it and send it Back and forth all the time I send a screenshot of it and then they told me that it should be written in english My app is in danish Thats their system They dont handle service seriously and avoid So from now on i will avoid agoda aswell Sorry
Have purchased from Wiggle a few times and its been great However the latest purchase was very poor
Some of the clothing did not match the colour of that on the web site  it was not even close But even worse one item a white cap had clearly been used and was also damaged I suspect this was a returned product which was then resent to me Its a minor hassle to return products via post so Ill probably just go back to to my regular bricks and mortar retailer
They claim to be a certain price but tell you another once you get there a bunch of extra hidden fees as well Customer service was poor and didnt care that they lied to me
i have still not received my pack
if you wanna lose your insurance money without damage and pay hidden fee of EUR 40 for booking your car to pick up after midnight  so book dickmaans
After you have paid the rent of the car at a brooker then you need just to pay 200 euros or 950 EUR when collecting the car
If you are reading the rest of the reviews many people are not getting this money back  same for me
To be honest I was afraid of using this company to begin with Well I made my pick Ill admit I could only find three reviews They however didnt mention any problems Made my choice and still yet I regret it I dont have a working vaporizer and while offering a upgrade aka not the vaporizer I wanted I have yet to receive it Three weeks gone and no resolution
Started well called them on a Wednesday an engineer came Thursday down hill from then The engineer asked for fault code  when I told him he asked me what that meant He hardly spoke any English Looked  boiler then started to walk out the door without any info on what was wrong I asked himwe needed a pump he would come possibly Friday Only to be told as we have bad weather he couldnt get part so Monday next time Ive got a 3 yr old so needed heating I sourced a part myself with 7 miles of my property and had to pay an engineer to fix it There is so much more but not enough space to write it
Save yourself money and personal frustration by utilizing a mainstream rental car service provider Hidden cancellation fees mileage limits and poor availability to physically contact the company to voice a complaint
Ive been referred to a bad business company with deceiving disappointing dishonest and abusive business practices
They announce on their recorded voice on hold that we can use their truck for free then we make plans accordingly all excited about that special only to be announced at the last minute that they actually charge 20 for using that same truck supposed to be free for use
Im even more dissatisfied and very dissapointed with your company sparefoot than the company you refered me to Mini U Storage because if you do business and refer your customers to such a deceiving and dishonest company and thats OK with you that means you must be the same just as dishonest and deceiving or possibly even worse
I will make very sure to leave reviews everywhere I can about this to everyone and everywhere about you sparefoot since you are the one I contacted in the first place and you are really the cause of this cheating and abuse I was just victim of
I also will update everyone of my referrals about you and will make it clear to everyone that I strongly Do NOT Recommend sparefoot as a trustworthy and reliable company to do business with
I hope you get better in the future and stop all the lies and deceiving either directly or by association
Your rating right now is virtually 0 Looking for your competition as we speak
Service has nonexistent customer chat on line I waited 30 min no response send an email no response
I order of each piece quantity 100 I find myself with one piece quantity 200
Completely different from what is showed online poor quality terrible colors cheap appereance Total dishonesty
Improve credit transaction
All other resistor values that I checked have a price break at 200 pcs except 1K Whats up with that
Poor expensive service
God I wish I would have seen the reviews for this website before I shopped They are known for ripping people off First I ordered something that never came then when I decided to just cancel my order they are refusing to give me my refund Its been over a year and they still are insisting that I received my refund Also my refund receipt was emailed to me with a date different from when I requested the refund Its like someone stole my money and tried to hid it Cant believe i have to go through this for a 70 dollar refund Never doing online shopping ever again
One of the passenger names got entered wrong and the website would not let me correct
I was a returning customer because I got my living room furniture and my bed set from here So when it was time to get my daughters upgrade I thought of them however her grandparents had gotten her a bed Im still waiting for my refund This was in December and its February hence 2 months after Not to mention the workers were smoking Marijuana in the garage when I came to talk to someone about my return Shop at own risk people
I originally wrote a review about this company because they did not send me the items I ordered
I tried emailing 3 times and got no response I tried phoning them but I got ring tone and then was unable to leave a message it just cut off
I also tried live chat but was left waiting for over half an hour
I went on to review sites and found that others had had the same experience
So after no response to any form of contact I went onto to Twitter and Facebook and Trust Pilot
My original review was removed because I used words like theft etc but to ignore calls emails and no live chat as a consumer it is pretty scary to lose money and none of the so called contact numbers seem to work
People lose money every day on the internet and naturally I believed that I had been hoodwinked
After a long time and many reviews I finally got an email from Keller Sports who said they had not had my order
They did refund my money in the end
However this has never happened before
I cannot say whether they are reputable or not they certainly gave me a refund which is good
I would not use them again though because of the stress they caused and because their phone number did not work they did not respond to emails and their live chat was non existent
They did however respond via Facebook
I would not say use them with any confidence There must be better sports shops out there
I ordered December 23 2016 Have not received order LL1612221251064552 According to tracking number BJ14824335039647 the order reached the US on January 2 2017 I set an email to both the delivery company sky56 and Dresslily csr svc NO RESPONSE Today I am unable to to track shipment again no response from tracking website
My first order was placed on 20161119 for a camera to be shipped from the German warehouse According to the description the camera was on stock and usually would will be shipped in24hours On 20161128 the camera still hadnt been shipped and I canceled the order I than ordered from Amazon and received the camera in 3 days and at the same price
My second order was placed on 20161127 for a Wifi IP camera On 20170112 7 weeks later I had still not received the camera and the tracking link only showed Shipment information received I wrote to customer service twice but never got any reply so I finally had to open a Paypal item not received claim
All the time they kept sending me daily advertising emails from which I tried to unsubscribe using the unsubscribe link and although I got a message that I was unsubscribed I still received the mails Writing to customer support asking to stop sending them did not help either so I had to block tomtop all together
My advise spend your money elsewhere
CASH ME OUTSIDE HOW BOUT DAH
I ordered 8 blinds in August 2016 and as at 13217 Im STILL WAITING for one the blinds to be delivered In the meantime I have had deliveries of poor quality incomplete blind kits and even non existent deliveries
In the process of all the problems I discovered that Blinds2Go do NOT actually manufacturer their own blinds and they are subcontracted out  you dont see any mention of this in their marketing information
Their delivery process is also not very efficient or helpful as they dont give you much notice when the items are coming and in my case the delivery driver left all 8 blinds big round containers which are about 6 high blocking my front door so I couldnt even get into my own house  thankfully nobody walked off with them
I have ordered blinds with them in the past and so have my friends however it seems that when it goes wrong then it goes VERY WRONG so beware
The staff was nice but I was not made aware that all sales are final Ive had my mattress for a few weeks and it is horrible I tried to return it and was shot down About 400 to sleep on bricksIm so stressed
I went back and forth with the Support service from CurrencyFair for several days before they told me I couldnt transfer money form Canada to the US Very strange as other companies do it such as Transferwise HiFX etc I do not recommend such a waste of time
I ordered a memory card by phone told rep what kind of camera i had she informed me this chip would fit this particular sony camera I finally received and it was not correct I want to return it but i have to pay for shipping then Im told i need to return it within 10 days with a certain form i had to download via email Now i have to send that form to my granddaughter so she can return the chip To crazy for a 15 cents postage stamp item Im hoping memory C will contact me so i can get a full refund
Items appear when purchasing rarely are delivered a lot of problems with site out of date
Always get a call to say some items not available even though they appear at time of purchase
At this point my package has not arrived On schedule but it has been over 1 week which is crazy slow in this day and age What is funny your review request beat the delivery
Ticket were not sent nobobdy at train station could help me and they didnt want to let me board despite they could see I had a booking and I had my ID card prooving that it was my reservation Complete non sense
DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH TAILOR4LESSCOM
It is with deep regret that I must inform you that the company Tailor4Lesscom should be thoroughly investigated for business malpractice They have received payment provided a terrible product which neither looks like what was promised on their website nor did mine get made properly at all Youll get the story of my terribly made coat below
I am of course an extremely unhappy customer and I am not alone In a 5 minute search I was able to find tens of complaints from tens of extremely unhappy customers All of whom warn others to stay away from Tailor4Lesscom for a variety of reasons ranging from terribly made products misleading online marketing to terrible customer service
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
I was extremely excited to order a new coat customer tailored to my exact body measurements
When it arrived I was immediately heartbroken
Tailor4Lesscom offers to fund further tailoring but as you will read they DO NOT take this seriously and DO NOT practice good business
1 The shoulders were 10 inch longer than the measurements I provided My tailor had to remove the arms and reattach them
2 The sleeves were stitched together with 3 different colors of thread black red and yellow My tailor had to take ever single piece of fabric apart and restitch the whole thing with black thread only of course
3 The sleeves were stitched together so poorly that there were holes at the seems one was 1 inches wide and I could pull the seems apart with little effort See the tailor task above
4 The overlap at the end of the sleeves which is supposed to be used to fasten the buttons DIDNT EXIST The person who did this part just made a straight cut then twisted the material so that the sleeves were triangular toward the ends The final 3 inches of the sleeves went from about 4 inches in diameter to about 3 inches in diameter This looked ridiculous and was uncomfortably tight around the wrists My tailor was so confused She had to add material to the sleeves so that they could be 4 inches in diameter straight until the ends
5 The coat materials do not match the images on the website This is a common complaint My coat is a nice color but it is a way way way lighter gray than what was promised So its not what I ordered
6 I have spent hours attempting to achieve resolutions by emailing Tailor4Lesscom and I have spent hours and used gas driving to and from my tailor Making the customer work is not good business
I communicated the final tailoring cost of 11550 to customer service at Tailor4Lesscom along with a detailed description of all of the problems their resolutions and the receipt from the tailor She stated nicely that the refund was on its way
The refund for the 11550 CAD repairs came in as 6734 CAD
SUMMARY
I paid 33678 CAD for a missmeasured poorly stitched coat with holes in it
I paid 11500 CAD to have it corrected to become wearable
I received 6734 CAD toward the tailoring
I effectively paid 4816 CAD for the corrections
I paid 2339 CAD duty fees which Tailor4Lesscom does not advise you of before purchasing
TOTAL I paid a total of 40833 for a coat which is now wearable but still looks bad and will probably sit in my closet long term
Several emails later all customer service was willing to do is to offer me 10 off and 10 toward my next Tailor4Lesscom purchase which will NEVER occur
IN CONCLUSION
People should be warned to NEVER SHOP at Tailor4Lesscom and the company should be shut down or fully reformed by regulatory authorities
Thanks for reading

I NEVER HEARD FROM HIM OR THE AGENT AGAIN I WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN nor RECOMMEND THEM AT THE VERY LEAST I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE A RESPONSE TO MY COMPLAINTS INSTEAD THEY IGNORED MY TEXTS EMAILS AND PHONE CALLS I NEVER EXPECTED TO HAVE CONSTRUCTION GOING ON DURING MY STAY ESPECIALLY WHEN I CALLED TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO MY ARRIVAL AND WAS ASSURED THERE WAS NOTHING
I have ordered twice with Tackel Direct First time they forgot to send me the free bag since I spent almost 400 and used the code to get the free bag Had to call on the phone They fixed the issue and sent me the bag Second time I ordered a buy on reel get one free Again they forgot to send me the second reel Had to call again They fixed the issue when you call their bluff I will not do business with them again as I feel they should just send me what I ordered It was an Internet order so not even a chance to make a mistake on my end Too many places to spend my money and get what I ordered the first time They have quite the selection just be aware of what they dont send you Use caution
I booked a flight online and everything looked accurate When I got my confirmation my name had been substituted with the name of a friend with whom I had travelled 2 years ago I had booked a flight for the two of us back then All I can assume is that Flight Hub still had my friends name in their system When I called them immediately to explain the error they told me I would be charged 75 to remedy the error that I had obviously made I argued at length but they refused to believe me They eventually reduced the fee to 20 when I explained that my credit card company would go to bat for me
My bills are often automatically estimated before i submit my meter reading within the allowed period to submit
When i wish to report this asap your live chat option is not working
So i am left with the only option of emailing which takes some time before i get a reply
I have shopped with AMI clubwear before with no issues However this year it was a little complicated seeing that they removed Trinidad and Tobago from the billing address options The site didnt even accept my paypall account
I hope they sort out this issue
Item bought a few weeks before Christmas as a present still has not arrived and its is now the end of January not happy at all
Dresslily says that they have something in stock but delays shipping 5 to 10 days and then it takes another 12 15 days to get it

The hotel didnt have our reservation information and we were unable to get a refund from this site Raping site
customs handling is too cumbersome
Slow to ShipDeliver Package Gets Beaten to Death Tracking can be Useless and for me to pay Handling Fees Custom Fees and Extortionate Shipping Charges is a Bit of a Joke Really a Big Company with Such Little Satisfaction to Offer I Dread my Parcel being Handled by them Lucky to even get it sometimes payed lots of money for Broken goods and I get the feeling they couldnt care less what people think of them sort out your Service Because its Utter Dog Shizzle USPS SUCK
I have been a long time NFM customer I lived in Nebraska and now reside in Texas Recently I purchased a KitchenAid combination unit amongst other things The unit is faulty have had 6 repair people are out and the disconnect between NFM and KitchenAid is comical at best Ive had NFM call me promising a new unit then turn around and say they have no record of that call THEY CALLED ME I have talked with supervisors who promise to call me back and then do not do so I once held them in high esteem and now because of Ericas incompetence I have lost faith
Ive bought several vaporizers from vapornation over the last couple of years My most recent purchase was a dr dabber boost It worked for 23 days and then stopped heating up completely No physical damage at all just a defective heating element I am very displeased as vapornation sold me a bum unitlemon I tried to work with there customer service for a few days hoping they would send me a new one After them playing a bunch of games they gave me absolutely no satisfaction didnt offer any solution and left me high and dry with my defective unit I strongly suggest making your purchases elsewhere they dont care about customers after the sale even if they accidentally sold you broken stuff This left an extremely bad taste in my mouth
I have the lightest period ever it only lasts a few days and never fills a regular tampon These dont seem to absorb anything It is like a plug that doesnt work well Am I doing something wrong 
my plane was grounded in Dunedin even on the news due to electrical problems but I was still charged
I will never buy here again Cant reach customer service Cant cancel order as per Company terms notified via email Cant find country of origin I purchased a Trump hat and realized immediately the country of origin was not listed I tried to contact someone to no avail I emailed to state I did not want a Make America Great Again hat if not made in USA I later received an email stating no cancellation as per terms and stating it was not USA made
energia are only interested in new customers
its just big scam site
I went there to purchase a new bed set frame included Purchasing the bed wasnt the issue it was the bed frame I had specifically told the rep i wanted the best frame to support my bed since it was over a grand in price I was assured what i was sold was he even showed me the one i allegedly bought Get it home and id been sold the cheap rinky dink frame So next morning i call and speak to an assistant manager who tells me i cannot return the one his rep incorrectly sold me but i could drive the TWO hrs back to the store and pay the upcharge for the better one that i had firmly requested the day id been in their store Being treated like i didnt matter i decided to reach out to the regional manaherIf it werent for Dean i wouldnt ever shop there again luckily he did make things right for his reps mistake But overall these stores need a change in reps this ia the second time ive shopped there and the second time ive had to get a regional manager involved Not sure if i plan to wager spending my time with this company
Had issues with one package and they didnt do anything Not even pick up the phone to contact the company that was supposed to deliver it They just arrange the delivery and wash their hands if anything goes wrong
The package was returned without even contacting me and now they want to charge me for the return as well So at the end I will have to pay double without any service received and this would have been sorted out just with one phone callemailetc but they DO NOT provide any support after you paid Thank you Packlink
You need to send a message through an online account before somebody calls you back 12 days later I was in a car accident and it was pure incompetency by 25plus on asking if I could make a complaint I was put on hold for at least 10 minutes before coming back to the operator who had clearly being laughing and have me the email address They are impossible to deal with if you have minor or major issues such as has been my consistent experience
Just always something with them and I find my bill is higher sence I moved over to them
this website is not very user friendly Specifically the checkout process
You no longer answer my queries sent to Biblio support
10 days ago DPD was unable to deploy a package at my door because the sender didnt include my personal name The parcel went back to the distribution center
The sender and myself have talked to customer service agents at least 57 time to get the address changed and resend the parcel First of all waiting time in the hotline is on average 5 minutes Each agent told us it would be delivered the next day
Day 10 and the tracking id 06080086016393 still shows that the packaged is at the distribution center This is highly unprofessional As a young ecommerce shop we were thinking about using DPD as logistics company Needless to say that this is not an option for us as we pride ourselves with customer servicenot bullshitting customers
cheap not what I expected or needed
Very bad had automated draft for payment and just found out there is a issue with insurance
I was a little frustrated with my last order from OptiContacts because I did not find out my contacts were back ordered until after I had placed my order There are countless online outlets that sell contacts all within the same price range and I would have used one of them had I known OptiContacts did not have mine in stock
Customer service was apologetic but it did not change the fact that I received my contacts well after the usual 36 day period
I waited 3 weeks for my book to arrive before I received an email out of the blue saying that my order had been cancelled
From the start the service was extremely unprofessional They dont provide you with a tracking number or the service they use Instead YOU have to email them and they will always say your item has been shipped It may take up to 30 days to arrive
Id like a bit more information than that EverythING about this company reads SCAM
Never again will I use this service
DOS VECES RESERVO ME COBRAN EN LA TARJETA Y NADA ME CONFIRMAN SIGO A LA ESPERA DE QUE ME DIGAN QUE PASO Y QUE ME RESPONDAN AL MAIL O TELEFONO
Title says it all Havent delivered I only have a promise date Company refused to upgrade shipping to compensate for their delay
I rented a car for a day in Bordeaux The receptionist was friendly The first problem was insurance Choice between 50 for a day or leaving the car in the car park uninsured as they apparently had no staff available at 530 to check the car on return I had no choice but to take the insurance They are also strangely silent about the fuel recharge penalty of 50  I was delayed and did not have time to fully top off the tank  I have no issue with being charged a premium of several cents for the fuels which is usual but not a flat fee of 50 The bill arrived at 7 oclock so they did mysteriously have personnel available to check the vehicle in I am a very frequent traveller and have rented dozens of cars but have never experienced such a crude rip off as this I am the CFO of a large company and have put Goldcar on a blacklist
I ordered metal chains instead of plastic Initially they delivered the wrong size metal chains The correct metal chains that were delivered had a plastic connector which failed on the first attempt at use They then sent continuous loop metal chains which were half the required length Eventually I received the correct chains
Three out of four blinds were ok the fourth was frayed at the edges and a replacement had to be sent
Delivery was appalling 5 attempts made to deliver by UPS The delivery slot given by UPS is before the end of the day
The only positive I can give is the customer service manager gave me a 15 discount and returned the cost of the metal chains
I would not recommend Blinds2Go to my worst enemy
I trusted this website because it says its partners with NFL I dont think its true but I am in the process to investigate I purchased a Redskins white Jersey and I got the wrong size so I send it back I never got a refund so I contacted them I was told my item was not in new condition even though I never worn the Jersey and therefore they werent going to send me a refund but they were donating it to a charity Honestly I dont believe it for a second that a brand new jersey was going to be donatedthis is the first time in my 10 years to buy online that I have been scammed
A few days before Valentines Day I ordered flowers through Flora2000 to be delivered in Australia and put a remark saying it had to be delivered that day Today Valentines Day at 9 am I got an email notification saying the order had been delivered and my card would be charged however the order wasnt delivered I hoped being 9 am Id have enough time to report it Flora2000 never picked up the phone until 5 pm Meanwhile I chat with them twice and all they said is I had to allow 24 hours to investigate This service is unacceptable and almost fraudulent
The flowers were not delivered on the dates  and have still not been delivered
I ordered flowers for valentines for my girlfriend they never arrived after trying to contact the company all day to see why they never arrived and ask about refund to no avail worst customer service Ive ever dealt with Id advise people to never use this company hoping to get refund off them after they ruined my valentines day Ive been trying to contact them since 9 this morning just spent 42 minutes on hold on customer service helpline what a load of rubbish this company is
In the past 2 years I have ordered 2 American flags and within 6 weeks I have had to take them both to a tailor and pay to have them stiched up When I called customer serv they told me it was due to the flag waving in the breeze Cheat me once my fault cheat me twice never again I really believe in supporting made in America goods and services but this company is making me find another source Too bad
You have many choices to buy contacts online Because of all these choices an online company had better deliver outstanding service otherwise why bother During my experience opticontacts wanted to charge me extra for shipping my contacts to an address when it was not my fault that I had not received my contacts at my primary address Their representative was curt unfriendly and not helpful I do not appreciate them and will not choose them again
If you have a verizon iphone with 4g lte you dont need to unlock it its comes from verizon unlocked All Verizon phones with 4g lte do not require a code to unlock it At first i didnt know this until I googled it after paying for a code that is not needed Why would you guys charge money for a code that is not needed Why wouldnt you just say on you website that most verizon phones dont need codes instead of charging people for a code that is not relevant That sounds like a scam to me
So this is a hard one but i ordered a hitch for a 2001 rav4 got a hitch for a 2006 or newer Thought maybe it was my fault but they have a couple listed wrong So everything is fast got my second hitch in a couple days The problem is i had to pay for the second hitch and i still havnt got my money back for the first one Customer support is great but they dont get back to you it seems like you need to get ahold of them
I picked up my rental car and to my dismay the tank was obviously not full I took a photo of this as I did not have time to address the issue straight away When I dropped the car off the man told me they would happily refund me but never did I am disappointed by this as redspot charge you severely for not having a full tank of fuel when you drop off the car and yet no consideration was displayed when this issue occured from their side
no one rang or contacted me
The purchase page kept automatically going back to the previous page when I would go to submit my credit card number erasing all my data Did this about 5 times before finally getting it to work Really annoying
Dont bother ordering if you want your food on time or warm When we rang after 15 minutes we were told that they were very busy we ordered at bang on five and the food arrived at 640 cold
Go to Bella Baby instead much better customer service and website I purchased an expensive Bugaboo stroller online for a friend living in Ireland I am in the US I emailed with an update to the delivery address and customer service responded that the product was not in stock and it would be up to 6 weeks before it would be in Why was I not notified before they processed my payment That would be too late so I asked for a refund which took a couple of days to process Because of this and the change in exchange rate I was not given the full amount back I paid in US dollars so I lost money and Tony Kealys has not offered any money back credit or help they told me to work it out with my bank A company should have updated software that does not allow a purchase to go through when items are out of stock and if it does the company should be responsible for covering the loss of  due to exchange rate because they processed and took money for a product they did not have Ridiculous that I lost money and have had to deal with this and received no product do not shop here
Your products seem to be declining in quality both in fit and fabric new styles are sold out almost immediately and uncheck very quickly every month Im getting disillusioned with creativity in your line Brogan style is a nice change but Ingas to buy the entire charleston outfit this month even though I did not like the top but although both were available it would only let me order outfit Hate to quit your membership but may do doing it continues to disappoint
Contacts were not in stock I am still waiting since early January for them to ship Since my son needed them urgently I would have appreciated honest information and ordered them somewhere else this time Now I am not sure I will continue with opticontacts
Gave two stars because the customer support changed the shipping to priority and split the order to ship whatever they had in stock
I had a lot of problems placing my order online
Hollywood Fl area I read a lt of great reviews from other states thinking Ill try it out I own a dodge stratus for the sake of the review  been canceled on 5 times now  all for different reasons with 10 minute notice of when they shldve been arriving Im giving them the 2 stars because they came finally one time  late without proper tools and took 5 hours to do a 2 hour job  take ur services else were
No refund provided Same standard messages When I ask the details of the standard message they simply reply again with that message Keep saying refund in 3 business days or up to 21 days on their website and neither are true
The product and the package is not from a original glass
My daughter purchased a prom dress Unfortunately the company doesnt update their stock immediately Her dress was put in the cart purchased and then 48 hours later she found out it was no longer available We have done a lot of online shopping and never have come across this problem before Your company needs to post that an item is out of stock immediately when it is put in your cart However we did receive a 20 gift card towards a future purchase
In november 16 we rent a car at Palma de Mallorca and paid for a full tank of gasoline We return the car after 10 days with a full tank and were told that within a week we would recieve the money we had paid in advance for a full tank Now 3 month later the refund has not been paid and Goldcar has no homepage to get in contact with
No wonder that Goldcar just have recieved a fine of 15 mill dansh crowns
I ordered 5 packs of shelves The quality of the shelves in not good each pack had some damage probably due to the soft metal used They only had 4 corner supports so after assembly they are not sturdy Delivery was fast and purchasing was easy
If you ever have a problem with your order customer service at gettington is not friendly at all They are usually very rude and unwilling to help you In addition no matter how good you are with your account paying payments always on time and paying more than your minimum payment it is like near impossible to get a credit increase and if you do get a credit increase its tiny and not enough to be able to buy the over priced items your wanting I have a fingerhut account and they are much more easier to work with if you have a problem with your order Fingerhut customer service is much more friendlier and they go out of there way to help you In addition much easier to get credit increases with Fingerhut Plus fingerhut offers more promo codes than gettington Over all gettington is NOT a great company at all
Gave them part number from a control unit i needed along with vehicles vin number They still sent the incorrect module Now they do not have the correct one Have to ship this one back and wait on a refund because of their mistake Very poor business
The trees had the tap root cut and the terminal buds cut The trees had few feeder roots
Berries were spindly with few feeder roots
The wig itself isnt bad  it expands A LOT over time especially in the wind but its workable Shipping was a mess because they made some errors with my order and the customer rep I spoke to was unpleasant Overall not a great experience so I probably wont be buying from elevate styles again but I would buy the wig itself again
Saw Altura Dryline 56 pannier on the website at what appeared to be a reasonable price Website was not clear as to whether this was a single or pair of panniers I requested clarification and was assured that it was for a pair Would have been very expensive for a single and would have bouth elsewhere
Parcel arrived and only a single pannier Pannier delivered was Altura Dryline 32
Customer service was almost useless Every message was treated separately and they kept requesting photos that I had already sent Cost of return via Australai Post was 100 so asked them if it might be better if they arranged collections  reponse please send photos
Found out that ProBikeKit is a brand to The Hut Group and found email of media enquireies person Vili I sent an email suggesting that if ProBikeKit did not sort my problem that I would raise the matter with Trading Standards in UK and Quote d the Consumer Contract Regulations 2013 and the Consumer Rights Act 2015 which are the Rregulations and act which cover sale of goods
On my next contact with ProBikeKit through the website things started to happen
Shame it takes so lomg for ProBikeKit customer service to admit that they stuffed up
ProBikeKit have arranged collection for return of item which has now been collected I now await my full refund
I would not ever hire a car from this company again and would also advise you not to hire a car from them as the service is unacceptable From the very start of the car hire process it was a sham When we picked up the car it had 4 damaged panels on it we stated we were not happy to take the car but were told this was the only car available and to complete a form to preidentify the damage was present at pick upWe were advised there would not be any problems if we followed this policy we did this
We dropped the car off after hire with no further damage to the car but when I arrived home over 700 euros had been taken from my account for the damageIt is impossible to talk to Gold car after you car hire experience with any problems you have to e mail the companyI emailed the company many times and every time it took week to get a reply The issue has not been resolved and its taken 16 weeks to get to the unsatisfactory resolution that we wont be receiving a refund for the damage that was highlighted at pick up
We have been left considerably out of pocket following our car hire experience the car hire cost more than our total holiday Gold car appears the cheaper option but in the long run you could be left with a very expensive car hire experience and many hours of your own time wasted trying to resolve the issues which will possibly end with you being left very frustrated and out of pocket
The hire car company are insisting there is more damage to the car than highlighted at pick up despite this not beeping the case at drop off There can only be two explanation it is a fictitious claim that there is more damage to the car or that the damage was done after drop off but I am still being charged for it
Do not hire a car from this company as the treatment customers receive is diabolical and unethical
I purchased a bula board prior to Christmas for my husband He used it less than 6 times when creases started appearing in the board I contacted them by phone and was advised to send in photos which I did I got no response for over 3 weeks so I phoned them again as was told that I had damaged the board myself but that they would call me later in the day They did not call me back so over a week later I emailed them again to remind them that this faulty product was under warranty to which they responded within 2 days to say they would not refund me as I had damaged it Very poor service and no intention of upholding warranty obligations Despite my requests for a physical location to return goods I was told that they do have a physical address but goods can not be returned there as there are no customer support personnel at those premise I will not be using tradetested ever again and would not recommend them to anyone
took 50 minutes to hire car only one agent working did not have my reservation even thou I booked it on line then had to wait for a car at 0800 on a Monday morning No one around when I returned the car
Deceptive
Never rent a redspot vehicle and expect to drive away in the vehicle you have booked
after the scan it says my Asus laptop is up to date on all drivers Ha I have minimal functionality at best back to the web see if I can find what I need and install it myself glad I didnt pay much for this crap
I booked the car with the intention of paying a deposit and the balance later I didnt see the poorly located box that needed ticking because it was
defaulted to pay the full amount until after payment was made I dont recall seeing a prompt about this either I believe that Ive paid in full months to early Genuinely not happy I feel the layout of the detail on the website is 
I made the mistake of looking into refinancing my mortgage and they have been harassing me ever since I told the first person that called me that I was not interested but they have been harassing me for over a week calling at all hours of the day and night If I lived in a state where my Attorney General actually worked for taxpayers I would be reporting them LEAVE ME ALONE
Never sent me my 400 camera and didnt want to refund me and would hang up on me I had to file a claim with my bankcredit card to get a refund
Never book with flight hub againafter spending 11 hours on the phone in total trying to cancel or reschedule my flight I am presenting waiting 20 minutes to speak with a manager to no avail 3 days laterThey immediately put the 25000 cancellation fee on my visa but I have to wait 68 billing cycles to get my 93200 refundthis is so disappointingNever AGAINI will be posting my displease on all possible media sights
I used this company twice The first time everything was fine although the free gift left a lot to be desired small bottle of lubricant
However the second time I used them has been a complete disgrace I ordered two items one of them was a Jessica Rabbit Slim When it arrived we opened the box and we completely stunned to find that the rabbit was completely covered in an oily substance Thinking this might be some kind of packaging substance to protect and sterilise the product during postal we decided to put batteries into it When we opened the battery compartment we saw that there was a lot of oil inside When we put brand new batteries in the product never worked
I contacted the company by telephone and spoke to Richard and when I told him what we found I advised him that it was like someone else had used this product and sent it back and then it was shipped out to use I did not say that was what actually happened I simply said to Richard that it was reasonable for us to think that He got very aggressive on the phone and threatened legal action and accusing me of all sorts He never once apologised or gave me any explanation as to what might have caused the product to be covered in oil He continued to be aggressive on the phone and repeating his legal threats
This was not the way I was expecting this simple issue to be dealt with All he had to do was apologise and say he would look into the issue and get back to me He didnt do that he was aggressive and totally over looked the fact that his company sent a sex toy out to a customer that was covered in oil and didnt work
Another issue I have is that although the products are sent out in a courier plastic packaging the companys initials address and company number are clearly displayed on the package I think most people ordering sex toys online do so because they dont want anyone seeing or knowing what they are buying at least thats our reason The fact that the company details are printed on the front of the packaging is not exactly discreet However that is just a small issue but the main issue is the condition a product was sent out to us and the unprofessional and aggressive way my complaint was handled
I am still trying to get this issue resolved almost a month later but I have to say that I would never buy anything from this company again and I would NOT recommend them to anyone
They have just sent me an email saying they have applied a credit to my account even though I have already advised them I wanted a refund and they had already said they would give me a full refund Oh and not one single word of apology in the email they just sent to me
I would be very interested to know what other people might think if they bought a rabbit type sex toy online and when they got it in the post and found that it was covered in oil and didnt work what would you think
I ordered sunglasses on December 29th 2016 I paid for overnight shipping which was 1800 California came out of a drought Megyn Kelley got a new show property insurance rates rose and our new president has already taken a vacation all before I received my sunglasses I just want my very expensive sunglasses that I paid for

I had a bad experience with hotel room booking under Amomacom
Despite credit card payment was carried out with confirmed accuracy of my email address given I did not receive any hotel confirmation voucher issued by Amomacom
I do not know what went wrong actually For an international linked hotel room booking website like Amomacom the hotel confirmation voucher should have reached to my email account on timely basis Apparently it does not appiled to this hotel booking website
I am really angry and frustrated for the inconvenience caused
Ive been listing items for sale on eBid on and off for a number of years now and have to admit that I am very frustrated with the incredible lack of success that I have experienced I also sell on a similarly named auction web site on which I have enjoyed remarkable success over many years in fact so much success that I make my living trading on this alternative site so I find it hard to believe that the fault of my miserable level of sales on eBid lies with me
I see from my listings that there are many many views of my items for sale but these very rarely translate into actual sales Ive asked the eBid community and eBid itself for their insights on this but no one seems to have any real understanding as to why this is so One thing I have found is that despite the numerous views my listings attract hardly anyone I speak to has heard of eBid and I think this needs to be addressed by those in charge of the site It strikes me as odd that despite such low public awareness of the site within a very short time a new listing that I place will gather tens of views sometimes one hundred or more It feels as though something is not right here and I would like to know how eBid actually calculates hits for listings
Another reason for my poor sales could be the eBid website itself For me it is not so easy to navigate as I would like and feels cluttered at times In addition its appearance is drab and not half as appealing as the former purple and green format that was once used
I try to encourage all my customers from other sources to visit eBid but with only very limited sales success Something is putting them off and eBid need to engage with this to find out what that might be
On balance eBid is a great idea I would switch to it permanently if I could be sure of the volume of sales that I achieve elsewhere but until the site becomes more well known I wouldnt dare take the risk
Pelican shipped a double order and then took 2 weeks to get call tags for a pickup and then no one let me know when to put it out for pick up I have had to call numerous times to make the pickup and now my credit card has not been credited yet If I knew there customer service was so bad I would have not purchased the system from them I was told they would send me some extra filters to make up for the hassle but havent seen anything yet Bottom line they suck
give me money back
The information said 430 count and I only received 50 Very confusing After a week have not received an email back to my response It looks like theyve changed the information on their sight after I ordered
The 1st item I bought from you did not work When I tried to return it you sent an email wanting me to send you a video of it NOT WORKING How dumb is that I wont be purchasing anything else from this company  I will tell my friends to do the same
Never again Bad quality
Ive ordered some shorts and gels which havent arrived in the specified time Two emails asking why havent been responded to I had placed another order with Wiggle  UK AFTER my order with PBK and have received it within 8 days If I had read some of these overwhelmingly negative reviews I wouldnt have done business with PBK They should be embarrassed at all these crappy reviews
Lizzie and Andy  how do you sleep at night
I found your website unorganized confusing and difficult Once I got to where I needed to be it was fine but the getting there was all over the place When all people spoke of Mabels labels they all say great product but terrible website I think it definitely needs to change to make it easier on people
Ordered an android box Item took 3 months to arrive It came damaged and they asked for pictures After I sent pictures they took another 2 weeks to respond after numerous emails from me Then they wanted me to send it back on my cost which would have been a third of the cost of the item and they would look at it For all this hassle I just tossed it not worth it dealing with them and being out more money
The first woman I talked was fine We were able to come up with Spark Energy However the processing didnt go through and I was never informed I called back to follow up and the second woman told me about the first application She recommended another provider and when I asked if she has a referwnce she told me Do you not trust me This is recorded I am not going to lie to you I dont know why she got offended She was telling me everything over the phone and I just want you see it too Im not gonna remember all the figures over the phone for different rates per kwh consumption Good thing I controlled my temper I know I could just hang up but Im not really that kind of person We were still able to find one  Just Energy Hopefully That one will go through
I ordered a dress for my daughters upcoming wedding I received the dress and it is a beautiful dress but did not look good on me So I called to get a return authorization and was told I couldnt return it because the tag was removed from the dress Unfortunately my pet had pulled the tag The dress was perfect and not damaged in anyway They would not even discuss the issue with me This is to reply to promgirls statement  I read your return policy and totally understand that the dress be unwashed not worn or damaged  The dress was in perfect condition as I did not wear it wash it etcI had just received the dress the evening before and called first thing the next day My issue is that just because the promgirl tag was off the dress they refuse a return  The plastic piece that held the tag is still on the dress 
Understand they have a SUBSTITUTION POLICY If you want something specific even if they understand what you want and agree to it they can still substitute whatever they have available Ok arrangement but NOT WHAT I SPECIFICALLY requested a expected My dissatisfaction stems fromif you do not have what a customers SPECIFICALLY ASKS FOR in a phone orderconversation TELL THE CUSTOMER it is not available dont just substitute There are other florists who may have what you are looking for
I tried ordering slippers from Teeturtle but they didnt fit They didnt offer any return label so I had to pressure them even for that I just saw the refund processed and they dont compensate for your shipping cost either Shopping for clothing and shoes is difficult anyways with huge size variances between countries and even between brands within the same country I cannot pay a shipping fee to try something on and risk it not fitting well which is an extremely common experience I have to stick with companies with better return policies
Activated the PM chat line and inquired about a package PM10103351011216 First they repeated what was on the PM trace page Then when I wanted more they said it went to a processing center to be relabled and shipped overseas But that was six days ago and when I pointed out that the processing and air shipment should have taken only two days at most and thus package not moving for at least four days so I wanted to know why The chat person never came back to say anything so I terminated chat after 30 minutes of nothing Activated a second chat with different gent saying I needed to track a missing package But after I gave her the tracking number she never came back on line at all Obviously they do not have an effective way to find out the status of a package so I am not happy with their service and will likely not ever use it again Others cost more but are reliable and trackable
Have been using Strawberrynet for years Love how easy it is and much time I save Love it
I purchased tickets on the 12 of Jan 2017 from Tokyo to Okinawa for the 26th and Okinawa to Tokyo on the 30th I received my confirmation number When I got to Tokyo on the 26th I went to check in for my flight and I was informed that that I did not have a ticket and they did not have my name or anything for my round trip flights So had to purchase new tickets at a considerable rate increase When I got back home from my vacation I called this company to tell them what happened I told them that I did not receive any email other than my confirmation They refused to refund my money because the airline doesnt give refunds I said the airline did not take my money you did and that the airline had no record of me This is the worse company I have ever dealt with I just wanted my money back for services not rendered This is a rip off DO NOY USE THIS COMPANY I will keep posting until I get my refund
The lady I had was too nervous and confused She displayed too much reluctance as she struggled to work with me she had to get help a lot I had to return because I dound my tax return documents filled with blank sheets When I ask for my documents to be looked over they were not giving me confidence that I was getting the right service not even from the experienced They left me with regret and feeling concerned
We have bought a few things not on credit from this place A handful of issues but the latest one just breaks the camels back and comes back for more They claim they never received our order but they have 2 pre authorizations on our account They have promised to call back 4 times but just dont bother They have an 01 number that diverts to a condescending gentleman somewhere in England The first time he said it was because of fraud alerts as we hadnt made an order in awhile The 2nd time and after he repeats himself over and over but doesnt state how long it will take for the two transactions to reverse Further they tell me that they have nothing to do with it now as we didnt make any order with them He was extremely rude and said that he explained himself and I wasnt listening They made no attempt to explain why bank of Ireland have confirmed the 2 pre auths from littlewoods Bank of Ireland have told me to go through their fraud department at this point
I rented a small Lancia from Europcar last September for 16 days while my wife and I were on holiday in Sicily The rental was satisfactory and there were no incidents or problems We returned the car to Palermo airport where it was inspected by a Europcar agent and the return acknowledgement form was signed without any problems being indicated
Then in December I saw that I had had an extra 270  debited by Europcar from my credit card After a lengthy exchange of emails and telephone calls with the Customer Service department I was told that I had been charged for the replacement of two tyres and I was sent photographs of two tyres one totally burst and the other with minor damage Despite my evident good faith the Customer Service department stuck to the account given them by the Palermo branch and refused to reimburse me
The burst tyre was so damaged that it would have been impossible to have driven with it so supposedly it was the spare tyre and the damaged tyre was mounted on the vehicle In any case I had in no way interfered with the tyres during the rental
This case raises several issues
1 The signed return form at the end of the rental is worthless as Europcar permits itself to charge the client for any alleged damage or replacement when he or she is no longer there and able to verify the claim
2 The damage to the tyres can only have occurred during a previous rental and so the car was initially handed over to me by Europcar without a serviceable spare tyre and with one damaged tyre installed This is a serious safety concern and only shows that cars may not be properly inspected and checked between rentals
3 The Customer Service department never took my version of events into account and just blindly followed the paperwork forwarded to them by the Palermo branch
These are three extraordinary systemic failings in Europcars procedures
Naturally I will never be using Europcar as a rental provider again but I would urge any of you who do to take the utmost precautions when taking possession of and returning a vehicle
We order a unit to replace a unit that was already installed Tried to explain the power supply was different from the first unit The second power supply will only fit four cameras It came with another adapter for 7 cameras but the plug to the DVR is different from the 4 plug Tried sending a picture to the technician Really got nowhere Now i have a dvr that does not work and my entire system is not working Is there someone on a local basis that can help remedy our system and get what we need We are in San Antonio Texas

Having received a non working smartphone I posted it back at my own expense International signed service Ive since received three emails on three consecutive days saying that a delivery attempt was made Now my emails are not being answered Not to be trusted
I wait for almost two weeks and contact the courier many times but cant successfully received my shoes And I wrote to the customer service no response Ecco has many stores in UK why not have more options for delivery like the other brand Or change to a more efficient courier
I just relize that what a bought on BATRONIX is much more expensive than others online suppliers 
Twice now I ordered flowers which had a special significance to be delivered a certain day

You let me down 
Low quality Its just peace of plastic surface
The contacts were the right prescription but it took a while to get them When I opened the box both boxes of lenses had already been open Not good
I had very good experience with expert help
It took over 40 minutes to solve the problem
When I needed them they didnt help took both car and home insurance out close them both and gone with a more reliable company now
799 service fee stealthily added onto the cost 56 room went over 80 with taxes and that fee You can bet Ill be making it up by taking everything I can fit into my suitcase out of the breakfast bar
dont change something that works
Very bad experience Way to pushy seemed like i had to fight to get out Paid 20 deposit on couch i didnt want just so i could leave 20 bucks well spent

I have 2 ticket for inter v ac for my brother birthday but dont know what to do about it no one has told me when they will arrive
Although the staff was great and nice the cars they told me to choose either had no key were locked or dirty Since the dirty one had a key and I could get in it was the only choice I would never use this company again This being said when I returned my car my plane was boarding and I was 8 minutes from the terminal They did everything they could to help me And I made it
I just bought a Suunto Vyper computer and according to Scubastore web page there also was a USB interphase cable included in the package  shown in the product pictures
The cable was NOT included and on the box was clearly written NO USB included
Via the web page I complained over the delivery and asked themn to delived the cable also Only answer was that I could return the computer and get money backnuy another
This is simply not good enought
I placed my order on 1317  the order was for toothpaste keys 2 can grips  and emergency blanket The toothpaste keys shipped on 112 the other items have not shipped as of 122 I think the service is very slow and am not happy with the service and probably will not order again I dont understand that it takes over a week to ship one item and the others havent shipped and it is almost 3 weeks and no communication from them on any problem Poor service
We were sold a cheaper price for our electricity but it is more expensive we are most dissatisfied with this we will be switching as soon as we csn
My review is not with the items or nondelivery itself but the fact that I paid extra for express shipping but the items arrived well outside of the express delivery time frame and they refuse to refund me the costs for the shipping and are blaming the supplier
Do not pay for expedited shipping  you will not receive your items in the expected time and you may as well pay for normal shipping or choose a different website altogether
I placed an order and paid for express shipping which says 37 business days on the products page One would reasonably assume this means from the time of order There was no indication on the page whatsoever that there was a backorder or delay in items or that they were out of stock It was 11 business days before I received my order
When I contacted dresslily requesting a refund of the express shipping fee due to the items arriving well outside of the express shipping timeframe they refused their excuse that it was to do with the supplier having a backorder and not being able to ship them in time but that once shipped the items still arrived within 7 business days of when they were shipped out
Nowhere on the items page was it noted that the item was on backorder or that there would be a delay in processing my order before it shipped it It is misleading to lure customers into paying extra for items Most people pay for express shipping because they need the items for a particular dayevent and would not pay the extra if they knew that they would not arrive
Dresslily refused to refund me what I paid for the express shipping and their response was in their words
We are sorry to tell you we cant refund you the money you paid for the shiping Due to the item you ordered is popular demand it need a little bit longer processing time We have already paid the freight to the carrier So please understand that we cant give you a fefund Because the items are supplied to us by the suppliers The supplier havet supply the item timely due to backordered We hope to your understanding and offer you our assurance of better service in the future
Basically it took a week to process my order before they even shipped it out Good customer service would have been to refund me the entire charge for the express shipping fee that I paid but instead they have blamed a supplier and refused to take ownership or provide good customer service
Will not be ordering from dresslily again
It is very frustrating to try to contact USPS when I find that a parcel I have paid for has gone SERIOUSLY ASTRAY I cant send an email because the form only accepts US information I cant phone because the system doesnt recognise the tracking number and when I finally get through it says office closed and I cant track missing mail as I dont have an account
I have used USPS for many years and I have found the customer service of US companies in general exceptionaluntil now
Why has my package from Connecticut to my home in the UK travelled via Denmark and then Sweden Why has it been stuck in Sweden for 12 days now with no movement I know that I can see the tracking information that they see but there must be a reason why it did not come to the UK direct
I paid for a priority service with 610 business days delivery The package set off on 30 January It is now 15 February and it is IN SWEDEN NOT the UKand because it says on route to destination on the USPS tracking system there is no problem as far as they are concerned DISGUSTING
I have tried to get answers but I cant even get a message through
My biggest regret  the seller gave me the option of USPS or FEDEX I have always found USPS slow but reliable  what a mistake I made this time
Message to the people of the US USPS represents your country when delivering mail internationally At the very least I would expect some level of service that gets a package to my door

I submitted my prescription and it said my prescription may change after a year but one month later it did not change You called my doctors office and they said I should come in for a visit My eye site has not changed I should know and I did not want to go back to the doctors office because they just want to over charge me for their contacts
I reordered with price smart contacts they are a couple of dollars more but well worth it
When I presented the copy of itinery they ignored the original contract
And recalculated fee and forced me buy insurance even the private insurance was presented They would not rent me the car They said that is their policy not to rent their car without buying it
I never experienced this before This total fraud and this should be reported to BBB I have reported to my credit co to dispute
Other than that you did great jobThanks
I was charged for an extra day Things were rectified but it was still a pain to have deal with this sort of thing when you are on holidays
I bought an expensive vape pen 75 dollars
The pen was faulty the tank couldnt screw on and would just keep turning because one of the twists was broken
The pen could screw on at first so I filled it with oil Yes I did so correctly I didnt put any in the middle hole like many people often mistake
It was after this that the pen then started leaking even though I had not even used it and the top then began to keep spinning like I had mentioned above
I contacted customer service
First of all even though my pen was disgusting from the leak and oil had leaked all over the outside and inside customer service decided to only send a new tank
The tank they sent even though they had my order number was for a different pen
They are now avoiding me at all costs I have not received anything more even though I have contacted them multiple times This is the worst customer service morals Ive ever had to deal with
When you get a faulty item that you paid for you get a new one in order to get your actual moneys worth Ive pretty much given 75 dollars to Vapornation for free
That is criminal
This isnt the first time Ive had problems with Play Asia but its most certainly going to be my last
I ordered a digital Playstation code for just under 10 The transaction shows as processed on both my Paypal and credit card account Play Asia are refusing to send me my code as they say it isnt showing as paid by their account team
Ive opened a dispute on Paypal and contacted Play Asia via their dispute option on there but they have failed to respond
Its a joke and Im half expecting the generic reply on here of Sorry about this If we can have your reference number well look into the problem for you Ive already given them all the relevant information COUNTLESS TIMES and theyre just ignoring my emails and messages via their websites support contact form
Do yourself a favourorder from another online supplier and save yourself the potential hassle of dealing with these crooks
Quand jai reu mon drone je lai perdu au premier essai suite a un dfaut de lautopilote Le plus grave cest que Hobbygaga ne veux rien savoir et ne me propose rien ni aucune solution pour rsoudre ce contentieux il rejette la faute a 100 sur moi BREF  DES VOLEURS et faite attention avant de leur faire confiance

After I placed my order I believe on Dec 29th I broke my ankle and didnt check my emails for about 3 days When I did check discovered my order had been canceled No one seems to know why I replaced the order VIA phone and was promised shipment by UPS on Monday the 9th Didnt receive the shipment until Friday the 13th by regular mail and not UPS
My son and his girlfriend booked a flight from Rome to NYC via Bravofly on a 12917 My son hadnt received a confirmation email by the following Monday morning so he called Bravofly to confirm Shortly after his phone call he received a confirmation email from Bravofly and immediatley noticed his girlfriends surname had a missing letter at the end of her name the misspelling is questionable in itself He immediately called Bravofly again and the agent he spoke to said they would take care of the correction and send an email to confirm Based on my sons conversation with the agent at Bravofly he assumed this was a minor change and it would be a non issue Three weeks later he finally receives a follow up email from Bravofly with a change request fee of approx 319 to correct the spelling of his girlfriends name they basically had to book a new ticket My son initially contacted Bravofly within the 24 hour time frame when he could have cancelled the flight and booked a new one without any fees However Bravofly assured him the name could be changed and NEVER mentioned a change fee My son would have absolutely cancelled the flight before paying a 319 fee I spent several hours on the phone with Bravofly today to resolve They said theyd send another request to correct the name and see if the change fee could be reduced In the meantime I called the airline TAP Portugal to find out if they could make the correction in the name without a ridiculously high fee They told me their hands were tied since my son booked through Bravofly and any changes would have to be made through Bravofly At the airlines suggestion I called Bravofly again about the fees and they said Id have to speak to the airline Keep in mind when my son first contacted Bravofly it was within the 24 hour cancellation period so he could have easily cancelled his flight had he know Bravofly would mysteriously add on these fees Here are the many complaints
1 Original email confirmation was not sent until my son requested it
2 When my son finally received the email confirmation well within the 24 hour cancellation period he noticed his girlfriends surname had a missing letter at the end of it so he called Bravofly immediately to correct and add the one missing letter yet they NEVER mentioned there would be a fee he would have cancelled and rebooked a new flight had he know
3 My son received no follow up correspondence for 3 weeks again had he know there was an issue he would have been contacting Bravofly frequently
4 When I was so fed up and inquired about canceling the reservation I was told by the agent at Bravofly theyd have to put in a cancellation request and wait to hear back re cancellation fees Im assuming that would take yet another 3 weeks before my son hears back from Bravofly
I will be in contact with Bravofly again on Monday its ridiculous you cannot reach anyone on a weekend Something unethical is going on with Bravofly and we will get to the bottom of it

The over all course was outstanding except for a few chapters were a little too long on the reading time out and Id noticed couple of the questions I did answer correctly were indicated that i had answer it wrong
They took my money when I placed the order but then claimed they couldnt process the order because of an address discrepancy Took 5 days for them to figure out there wasnt any discrepancy By then the item I ordered was out of stock 3 weeks later I called to find out where my order was and they told me that they had decided not to restock that particular item They claimed someone was just about to call me I told them to cancel the order and all of a sudden they decided to have the manufacturer send me the item directly They could have done that 3 weeks ago I will NEVER order from this company again
Great quality but DONT forget to opt out before the 5th or youre stuck with a 4995 charge
I purchased from the Car Mats site and the whole experierence was easy and slick With my order I received a 10 discount code to buy from their parent company same products Premier Products Ltd
As I wanted some more mats I tried to order from the Premier Products site but this is a total nightmare and nowhere near as slick When ordering the rubber mats it does not give you the option to select other patteren options as does the Car Mats site After placing my order I quickly contacted Premier Products to verify the rubber finish I required anad after 3 days the customer services manager responded by saying if they arrived wrong they would rectify the problem
Great I thought but when they did arrive as not expected I contacted customer services again but my emails were totally ignored so now I have to live with the mats rubber pattern
Im sure Car Mats will come back with the usual response of phone their customer services number but if they cannot respond to an email then I dont see the point
So buying from Car Mats was a pleasant experience Premier Products which are in effect the same company are just too much like hard work and so is best to avoid their web site
I have never received any emails from you
As I said previously emails totally ignored
Well I followed Car Mats advice as instructed in their response to my review and all I can say is their customer service is useless
Yes they make all the right noises on here when responding to a bad review but then never follow it through and just ignore you
Use these people at your own risk because if a problem arises then you are stuffed
I feel that flighthub charges high fees unnecessarily for cancellations at 350 In addition to this fee you also need to pay fees directly to the airline so it makes much more sense to book directly with airlines or other sites that do not charge such exorbitant fees
Was checking out ranges the other day and found one for 939 Came back on MLK day and the price had suddenly risen but it was on sale for 939 At least I got free delivery for the MLK special Then theres the whole Price is Lower in Checkout  mine was a whole 5 on the 939 purchase
I have not received my order that was placed 21 days ago Not happy
Placed order day before of delivery date Order was not delivered to receiver Nobody informed me that delivery was not possible After calls and mails nobody answered i cant chose 0 stars that would be reasonable and acceptable rating for this company for Ignoring customers and not delivering the orders
PS also i guess money of order also wont be returned because nobody is answering
Poor experience I recommend everyone not to order anything from EuroFlorist

My site load speed went from 4 seconds down to 20 seconds loading time on their servers and they stated the developers of my theme were to blame Moved host now back upto 15 seconds on litespeed cloud server and the developers havent done a thing  Cloudflare helped speed things up but still not fast enough
Booking process all went smoothly accept when I got to the hotel in NY I only had heating for one day I contacted Flight Guru in turn said they contacted the hotel That I cannot verify For the whole of my trip I had no heating in my room and myself and child were sleeping in our dressing gowns I have now contact Flight Guru about my trip since I have been back and told them that I was not satisfied with the treatment by the hotel and I would like to recoup some of the money They have brushed my complaint off They said they would get in contact with the hotel I rang and chased and nothing has been rectified I have heard nothing since Very disappointed
I ordered 3 weeks ago and I still dont have my contacts I called to see what is taking so long and they stated they were on backorder I asked them to upgrade the shipping so that I could get the contacts I needed Their backorder issue was not my issue The rep gave me a Too bad so sad attitude and said he would not change the shipping This is the first and last time I will order from this company
Monthy call to india plan price is high
I am not satisfied even with the order because I request a change of size and I still do not know anything

Stay far away from these schemers and scammers They place your bad reviews first and then dont recommend the good reviews They posted 3 negative reviews and I had 25 good reviews that were not recommended This is a dishonest company from the CEO down I am sure he has a family and he raises his kids the way he runs this company they will be good criminals like their father At one point in our lives we are forced to look at who we really are and if not at this life then the next and I am sure the CEO wont like it because it is hot there
Everyone see what is happening here with Yelp and start blogging and opening websites about them to expose their extortion and who these people really are I know that I am because I am growing weary of their nonsense lies schemes manipulations and dishonesty Please stay away from these people and dont trust their reviews
Trying to return an item that did not look a thing like the picture Went online to request the RMA and one of the questions would not save my answer so I couldnt get the RMA Emailed the company receives a response that an RMA would be coming soon I still have not received and that was 5 days ago Still waiting to return the item
I booked my flight then realised a few days later it was was the wrong date

One of the worst service provider  My money is pending with them from more than two month after the Daily and pinging and chatting no reply  In fedup with this  Eventually I transfer my domain to other  still they are not refunding my money
This is what I sent them of course it was rejected
I want my money back it says within 24 hours of activation but I bought it 3 days ago your service is so slow that it will have been 6 or 7 days by now When it finally started working i logged into multicraft and it said login temporarily blocked You have to send a support ticket to get a dedicated IP so ill be waiting another 4 days I payed for my server on February 7 and just got it a few minutes ago Even though i couldnt use my server I still am having it renewed im definitely not using this service again This hosting service is terrible
The countdown timer made the shopping experience very stressful
I ordered some equipment before a 3 week ski trip One week after giving the order the products where still not dispatched
I contacted the customer service by email For each email it took 2 to 3 days to get an answer with no helpful answer
I finally called them but same situation they didnt offer any solution
Will not order with bike24com again customer experience was not good
never use DPD cancel in last min made waiting for ever
Reserving on line after filling out all the boxes including credit card information I was told that room not available No other rooms offered instead So when I tried again none of my information had been saved although another suite at the same price was available Online process quite annoying
orders are always late
I placed an order for 2 items I got an email telling me there was an issue with my order and that I needed to call them I dont like to make calls because my recpetion is horrible so I emailed them back about the issue I finally got a reply and one of the items I ordered wasnt in stock and they had no idea when it would be so I told them to just cancel the order I got another call is email and I replied instead  they said theyd cancel it then i got a voicemail from someone there and they said they had the item now and did i want to go ahead with the order I emailed  again  because I thought it had already been canceled and refunded I guess not I got another email saying theyd be happy to throw in a free vaporizer or cleaning accessories if I wanted to go ahead with the order i told them that was fine When the order arrived my free vaporizer or cleaning accessories were junk tossed in my box some cleaning wipes a cheap wood grinder and some granular cleaning agent it was all garbage I appreciate that they tried to make me happy but it fell short I probably wont order from them again The items I ordered were fine tho
Hoping that I didnt sign up for a future payment and not be spammed

I purchased a set of tables that were not delivered to me on the date that they said they would be I had to call the company to find out where they were they did not inform me about anything The tables even at the factory but they were being shipped to the factory and it took two weeks for the process Once they were in the company was going to charge me double to come deliver because they had already delivered the mattress that I bought with the tables I had to go pick up the tables and assemble them myself You get what you pay for cheap prices along with terrible service
The sellers name is Juno Showers They sold me a faucet that they knew was defective They would not work with me for a resolve Houzz could not do anything to satisfy me Think about it How could Houzz do anything other than stop allowing Juno Showers to sell on their web site They are not going to do that If you have a problem with something you purchase on Houzz You are screwed
Despite showing documents that we had it already organised we were charged for insurance again We were given the impression we had no choice but to pay and it highly upset my frail mother Will never use this service carrier again
Never went to their website let alone buy anything from them yet I was on their mailing list I can only imagine how they got my email adress
Now do you want to support a company that engages in spam go ahead but the five stars revies in here are most likely to not say obviously fake
i have never yet stayed anywhere that we have had to travel to collect keys for an apartment we have a transfer booked to collect us from the airport and take us directly to Finastrat this was not mentioned at the time of booking that means we will now have to get a bus to take us into Benidorm with our cases to collect keys and the get a bus back this was not stated when we booked the apartment otherwise we would have stayed else where very disappointed customer
We are trying to contact them for a few days they shipped our package to a wrong address
I am it happy with my purchases The lotion I bought is a pump and it barely comes out so I gave to open the bottle and pour the lotion out I sent email about returning item and unfortunately was total I am basically out of luck because the item is not in new condition Of course it is not in new condition I tried using it If that is the case once you take any product and try to open it or try to use it you can no longer return it because like when you buy a car once it us off the lot it us used
Courier Jason ring me this afternoon to let me know he will be waiting downstairs in 2 min with my parcels When I got down I discovered there is no driver no Van and no parcels tooo fast didnt wait even a minute

He didnt respond to my phone calls
The experience was ok in the beginning at drivetime I went here on last minute recommendations I saw a few suvcars i liked and decided on the malibu Should of known something was wrong when we got in an test drove it and boy the wheel alignment was way off Had that fixed had the car maybe 2 weeks engine light comes on Was advised to take it an in network dealer Ok did that 3 times Resolution per the dealer the gas cap was the issue Ok problem 2 2 months later driving on 26 and the car broke down towed to another dealer but out of network so they paid as if it were resolution time chain was broke and while in the shop mechanic asked when was the last time the oil was changed Advised mechanic we just purchased the car 2 months ago and was advised all that was taken care of His words exactly  it looks like it hasnt been changed in years its dirty  black and all gunked up ok oil was changed before it was returned to us We do our own oil changes and keep all receipts and they are done like clock work as soon as car advises us the oil is low Fast forward driving to work and car started making weird knocking noises i was coming off highway around a very dangerous bend and car cut off  omg Luckily i was able to coast out of harms way thank goodness Had it towed to shop and was advised the same thing guy told me after timing chain broke the oil is all gunked up and motor locked up now we change and have changed the oil since Was asked to supply receipts of the oil did that I am still under warranty and i was told that they will only pay about 50 for another motor which i was advised by dealer about 34 thousand and then labor I only had the car a year and a few months I was very happy with the service but after this experience i am very disappointed i was sold a lemon and now i cant afford to get it fixed and i still have to pay for a car thats not even running U would think maybe they could have done something for me maybe put me in something else Im paying on a lemon btw car has been in shop at least 5 times and now it doesnt run at all

Flighthub is difficult to navigate and it is annoying that you have to scroll through everything repetitively
From ordering to delivery to have it in my home has been nothing but a nightmare I couldnt order online because of something so I had to call and wait to order the bed then when the bed guy here that they didnt know what they were even doing they never set up a bed in their life you guys did not know what they were doing at all there were things wrong with the bed and one of the guys kept asking me out and wouldnt leave my apartment so now I sit here waiting for parts to make sure my bed is fixed its a mess and I hate it I would never do this again kristie Sacco
I ask for loan they paid another company on my behalf without my consent and taking money out of my account

Cake was hard as rock it took a day to become smooth after it was smooth people who ate the cake were suffering with vomitings
When I first signed up for the service I loved it Loved it I could get a live person on the phone whenever I needed I could go in and play with the settings And a lot of time I couldnt get it quite how I wanted it but I would call get a live person right away and they would fix it right on the spot Even as I had them do it one way and then another they were always super helpful and friendly
So being pleased with the service I decided to add more phones for my growing company Suddenly this company that I loved went from the easyto workwith business that I loved to what felt like another annoying phone company The person I called to add more phones couldnt help me If I only wanted a total of 4 phones he could help me If I wanted more than 4 phones I wanted 5 total then I had to go through a different person And I couldnt just order the phones and plug them now I have to have somebody sell me a phone system And the pricing changed and all of the sudden got very expense After much negotiation they finally agreed on a lower price still more than I was paying and more than I was Quote d on a per phone bases at first and they sent me phones and I plugged them in
That is all I wanted to do Order more phones plug them in and pay the same per phone price that I was paying with with one phone Just like I did with the first phone Just like they told me I could do when I originally signed up Just like I ended up doing But in the middle they had to throw in a bunch of bureaucracy red tape sales crap upselling price increases and negotiation
They took my experience from one of extreme happiness with them and made it a pain For no reason I ended up doing exactly what I wanted they just made it a lot harder for no reason and more expensive
If you need less than 5 phones for your company I would recommend them If you need 5 or more then they are nothing special Just another phone company so do what you would like
One more side note all of the people have been great to work with David Amer has been extremely helpful He is the person in charge of my Phone system now
The people are good the companys own unnecessary policy and bureaucracy made my customer experience poor
They some how charged me for an order I was not aware of  I have been trying to get my issue resolved and get my money back and they are rude  They will not cancel the order  I know how to wait for the item to be shipped back and wait to be refunded for something I was not aware I was even be charged for  I never put in my Credit card info or CVV SCAM OF ALL Scams 
I chose my girlfriends favourite flowers but she received roses They are not between their favourite flowers
I dont even know where to begin Purolator is literally the WORST delivery company I have ever experienced They have done this to me 3 times so far  either leaving packages outside my front door without notifying me or even knocking The second time they did that the package was not there but Purolator claimed that they left it When I told them it wasnt there they simply took no responsibility and essentially said they take no responsibility Honestly what kind of delivery service leaves packages unattended Ive had UPS or Canada Post attempt to deliver my package multiple times all in an attempt to protect my package This time around I had ordered something urgently which I needed by a particular day as I was leaving out of town Day one  they didnt deliver said the address was undeliverable or unknown Okay then Then I phoned them with instructions on how to deliver it where to go who to contact gave them a back up number and again they didnt deliver my package According to the tracking my package is is still on its way just delayed due to traffic Really That was 5 hours ago Honestly how are they even still in business
The bowl was broken upon arrival and had to order the thicker glass bowls from a different company needs to be sold with the tough bowl
My ticket was held in processing status for hours before the start of the event I sent an enquiry as I was concerned I wouldnt be able to sell the ticket prior to the event starting if it remained in this status I was told it was just a routine check and Id be advised with further info as soon as it was known I was never advised after some time I just saw my ticket had Expired under my account I could have sold this ticket on an alternative site or to a friend however could not complete those transactions due to the commitment to Ticketmaster resale Tried to find out more info so I could be released from Ticketmaster resale in a reasonable timeframe to allow an alternative sale but Ticketmaster resale did not allow this which cost me money about 200

I order contact lenses on November 27 and was told that since the contacts were a special order and I would need to wait 710 days They were actually delivered on January 4th 38 days later I would have cancelled my order and gone somewhere else but each time I called I was promised they would arrive and ship out in the next few days Now on to the positive part of the review All of the customer service representatives were friendly
Ive never received my labels even after I called and they were supposed to ship another set out Very disappointed
I find often only reviews that favor the business are seen Then when you go to that place of business you discover all the reasons you should NOT Have
First of all my ordet took 2 months
Second it was in the wrong color i ordered a cyclemask
And now they Wont let my sign off Their newsletter
Aaand they wont answer me on my complainings
My advice avoid This amateur Company
I had bought tickets advertised as being in a certain section in the venue however the tickets came labelled differently to how the venue seating plan was displayed
I made 4 phone calls and sent 3 emails and could not obtain a definitive response from any senior staff The tickets ended up being ok but I was worried until we arrived that they werent as they should have been We had flown Perth to Melbourne and paid plenty for these tickets and nobody would provide me a straight forward answer
The engraving I paid extra for looked like a child did it Very disappointing and I would not have done this if I knew it would look as it did It did not appear to look as the advertising specs showed when ordering so I would not recommend your business
Without going into all the details besides the obvious of having my order delivered on Valentines Day they were delivered a day before on the 13th I paid and specified for delivery on the 14th and it didnt happen
They charged me and they didnt even unlock my phone 
I started getting emails saying I ordered goods i did not I dont know how you got my name or email address I have a very unique name infact anyone with the same surname throughout Ireland are relations Its not an esdy name to mess up on an order Please leave me the Fk alone you spamming incompetent morons Regards Conor
Be careful when calling over the phone to try to buy a couch I had very simple questions about the mason track arm reversible sectional sofa in blue grey and had to call sales twice and they both couldnt answer my questions the first person I spoke to was a man who didnt want to be on the phone he told me he has no clue what fabric the couch has and that he would not do a price match because NFM doesnt do that Even though the price match was on a instock item I then responded do you have any couches similar to this one and he said I probably do but there is 100 couches so cant help you there I was so upset I hung up Then called again hoping to get a new sales rep and end up with this girl named katie or katlyn and she was complete snob She literally told me do you want to buy the couch elsewhere because I have no idea what the fabric is 
of course I get the same service from every supplier but I enjoyed it for the first 3 months and after that I am paying even more than I used to pay with my ex electricity n gas supplier my personal opinion I cant wait for my contract to be over to find another supplier
This is the second time I ordered contacts they took my order like alll was fine then sent me an email later that they are not in stock
Pretty annoying
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY I ordered my items JANUARY 2ND and I never received them NO RESPONSE TO MY EMAILS NOTHING You might as well throw your money in a ditch or a river TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE No way to contact them except email and they dont even answer you I will make sure I spread this review EVERYWHERE

Merce scadente
We purchased the Uberchild safe plus car seat with the knowledge that they offer a 30 day no quibble money back guarantee We put our baby in the car seat and tested it with him We drove to the shop and back a 4 mile journey He was asleep but there is very little recline in the seat and he just kept falling forward so the seat was not safe for him to be in it I went to return the seat and get the next one the faux leather one however i was told that as we had sat our baby in the seat it was deemed as used and they would not accept the return so a 30 day no quibble money back guarantee does not exist How else can you determine if the seat is the correct one if you dont sit the baby into it This is shocking cowboy stuff and i would strongly recommend anyone to pause and think hard before you buy this They should clearly state placing your child in the seat voids the guarantee not have it hidden at the bottom of their website in small print Even talking with the staff she straight away said no you cannot return it if you used it there was zero listening and she went straight on the defensive which indicates to me that this is a regular event Just buy with extreme caution or go to a reputable shop or trader
I asked several times for a regular confirmation of my booking as I did not want to download the app to see the booking
I received no response at all  not impressed

American Freight offered delivery by a third party at a price They promised delivery and pickup of old mattress  box springs at a set price The delivery guy came late and refused to pick up the old mattress The only reason I ordered delivery is for the pick up  I could have borrowed a truck and gotten it myself I was so upset I almost refused the delivery until the guy offered to take my old mattress at 3 times the Quote d price
Item ordered  paid for  not arrived after 9 days  Phoned to see where it was informed by very courteous and apologetic lady that it had made it to dispatch area and was then withdrawn  No longer available yet still advertised on line  Very disappointed that I had to chase this and ask for my money back  Even more disappointed that other places I had contacted had this item but had sold out during the period I was waiting for mine to arrive  Will not use again 
I ordered my contacts and didnt get a notice until 2 days later it was out of stock Still waiting 10 days later Havent heard a thing
I have smart planbut still pay much more than previous company with smaller discount
Thier affiliate program does not not work well and commission junction blocks commissions
Way too many items out of stock I couldnt even by leggings because they didnt have any of the 8 varieties I was interested in that were in stock in my size VERY DISAPPOINTING
We picked to order a crib from kiddies kingdom based upon the availability and next day delivery offered Whilst it was just after 2pm and the cut off stated 3pm I called just to check this would be ok 7 minutes later and still no pick up on the phone I placed my trust that the claims of next day delivery before 3pm would be honoured I should have known better from a company who cant answer their phone In the end product delivered within 48 hours but company shouldnt over promise to get a sale as this just leaves customers disappointed
Buying the ticket was relatively easy but then actually getting hold of the eticket was a pain There is no contact telephone no on the website when you do find it on Google you have to go through a long list of selections before finally joining the queue then I was on hold for between 10 to 20 minutes each time I had to ring 4 times as the ticket still had not arrived on the afternoon of the concert even though I had been promised they would be emailed You should have more customer services people and be as efficient delivering what I paid for as you are taking the money from me
Told me I would receive an email with all info we talked about and with address of facility Never received an email after 2 phone calls And there phone system is terrible
No phone number to ring and complain either chat if you are lucky or email  this alone shows they have a bad customer service Their delivery services is bad they cant seem to get in touch with their drivers that deliver parcels to a house where someone is in but they dont knock they just shove a card through the door and then you find out they cant redeliver over the weekend so it MIGHT BE Tuesday when you get you parcel All this nightmare after I paid for next day delivery which ends up taking over a week to get to you
I looked on the internet thought i was getting a driver for my phone ended up getting my computor scaned and then had three printers and as i am not an IT  guru ended up struggling for two days to get my printer to work and then my son fixed the down loading from my phone in about 3 seconds
This is now the third screen that i have ended up using to inform Driver support about my experience
I am sure that  Driver Surpport  has lots of great customers who are very happy with their service
Regards noel
I am NOT happy that Chewy ONLY uses Fed iINCOMPETENT EX  Customers should have an option
Plus I found everything CHEEPER on Joy pet
V sorry I changed to this company on the promise if cheaper electric Saw no difference and actually believe Im paying more Also previous provider allowed to make payments through post office for 6 weeks Energia is a one payment only all in a lump sum Promised a payforward plan but this is only for if you miss a payment I have saved nothing and will be changing back after my year
If you can  dont buy
Not satisfied We have a bad experinece Delayed delivery My order is different from what they delivered Never to order again in your site Theres no response from my inquiry
I found it extremely annoying and to a degree sly when looking for the true price of my insurance as each stage the Quote got dearer In my opinion all the preferences should be on the first landing page you meet so you see the true price prior to going forward to payment
I still used multi trip for this year but will need to reflect for next year as it wasnt really that cheap in the end
I have called for numerous issues with my service bills and hooking up new boxes My Calls have been dropped I have held for one plus hours my service has been disconnected my bill was doubledI can keep going I have been in the retail business for 40 years I own a business also which has suffered because of no internet and I have never been treated worse than I have from your company If I treated people as you do I would be living on the streets I pay my bill I get extra services and I cant get anyone to help me when I call If one out of 10 people feel this way you have a lot of issues I know 3 What does that tell you
You send me new boxes and it takes an hour on hold to get one hooked up and then they disconnect me Never call me back This is really unacceptable behavior
I cant begin to express my disappointment since you took over from Verizon I was hoping for something better and it gets worse everyday
Good luck in the business I believe in my area if things dont change most will go to Comcast I actually know a tech that was with Verizon an came to you I will vent this to him tomorrow I know Im just a pion in your world but figured Id let you know 2 weeks in a row you have ruined my week Guess my money cant buy cable and internet service
Good prices but in case of problems you are alone And of course  you should have red the agreement and the terms
Just lost my money with nothing but automated responses from the help chat Sad
I typically never write bad reviews But will make an exception for these guys  Too many things to complain about but let me highlight the top ones
Customer Service guys are LIARS  They say random things without any knowledge and will try and fleece the customers as much as they could Its like bargaining for vegetables in an Asian market Spoke to 3 agents over 3 hours
Agent 1 Cancellation charges CAD 75 Airline doesnt allow name change This within 10 mins of booking the ticket
Agent 2 Cancellation Charge CAD 75 Charged by Flighthub and CAD 75 charged by the airline
Agent 3 Cancellation charge CAD 75 Flighthub and CAD 150 Charged by the Airline total CAD 225 for a CAD 307 ticket
I had to explain fight scream teach them the Fare Rules etc for them to realize that the airline does not charge ANYTHING for the name change So after 3 hours of discussions speaking to one clueless agent after another they will all try and push you to cancel the ticket they still had the nerves to charge me CAD 40 as charges for change of name within 10 mins of booking Flighthub charges
Horrible agents horrible supervisor I had to literally scream at them before they do their job They did not even call the airline till i absolutely asked them to And they LIED saying that they did They lied AGAIN and AGAIN
First time using this website and had the worst experience ever First website in Canada that has charges for any cancellationsmodifications within 24 hours of booking No other website including airlines have any charges within 24 hours
Avoid this website if you can
Asked them to exchange damaged furniture but it takes full 2 weeks even they have in stock
3 times online claims 1 Repair guy visit then waited another week
Check every furniture on delivery day if you found return them in same day that is fastest way to return
I was very disappointed with the service at LightOnline I placed an order and paid for a medical bulb but found later that they had not ordered one from their supplier even after two weeks I called them on several occasions after that to see when it would arrive but was never rung back with any information on likely delivery date I finally asked for a refund which they did do quickly I then placed an order from a store in Hong Kong It was half the cost for the same product The overseas bulb was posted the day after I ordered it I thought dealing with a local company would be best but was very wrong on this occasion
They try to sell you extra and not necessary insurance by implying you dont have insurance via the broker
They fail to inform you over the phone about your rights in the insurance provided by the broker holiday autos regarding road assistance
They fail to return the money you prepay for gas
The waiting time in Malaga airport was about 90 minutes after a long flight
Avoid if you can
I have waited full one month after order and status of my order didnt changed no ticket service wait for the staff live chat lies about order please wait we will have your order in one week etc
Dont buy from them
I placed my order on January 18th As of today February 6th I STILL have not received my order nor have I had any updates on delivery I have paid over 20 for shipping albeit I am in Hawaii but I would think that if I am paying that much for shipping it would not take over two weeks to receive it I got my shipping notification the same day I made my order from UPS Great Its being shipped via UPS There was no estimated delivery date but hey thats okay because UPS is relatively fast January 25th one week later I check the status and it says that it has reached California and transferred to the USPS No notification via email If I didnt check myself I wouldnt have known Theres no link to track for USPS so I need to go onto another website to check the status and now the estimated delivery date is today February 6th Well the mail has come and gone and I still do not have my order I am VERY disappointed to say the least If I had some notification or estimated delivery time frame in the beginning when I ordered that it would take this long what I ordered was a gift and the childs birthday has past already I probably would not have ordered this item especially with the cost of the shipping
The order was never process and I never got delivery of the order I dont know what happen
Wrong tracking  was supplied leading to me calling customer service rep stated he would have to research and get back to me within a day He never called back I called back still could not get an answer Package arrived 9 days after ordering
Very poor shipping experiences sadly I had forgotten the prior 2 times I ordered products from Bariatric Choice back in 2015 But now I can tell you I am having the same problems with receiving their delivery again My orders from BC seem to always be delayed This time I tracked my order it took 7 days to arrive in Sacramento which is 45 miles from my home My order arrived in Sac on a Friday morning Yet it never made it to my house on Friday nor on Saturday and by Monday Fed Ex had removed the estimated delivery date which had been on Saturday and had no estimated delivery date at all So I am in limbo  out of my pocket with no products Find a better company that can provide decent shipping times
Gave me the run around Twice
Would NOT refund my ticket I bought 5 hours earlier Eventually I called Alaska Airlines and they were kind fast and gave me a full refund as I was within the 24 hours
I will never use this search engine again

They took my money I was calling Amomas sales but customer service makes me wait for over 20 minutes each time and i only get automated replies if you try to contact their customer service via email
They say that they will return my money in three days but until now they dont do it
I m in Puerto Rico I want my money back

Bought item off website only to discover later they had already sold out
The delivery had to be done upon signature and with no possibility to change the destination which means I had to leave work early to receive the contacts Contact lenses are not worth that hassle I will choose another supplier next time
Flowers were good but delivered only next day afternoon Euroflorist customer service never replay on my mails with some explanation or just simple sorry It was unfortunate experience on a Valentines Day
Once again shipping is delayed for more than 10 days because of backorder status But I wasnt told at the time I ordered Its been two weeks and theyre still several days away
I was Quote d 77600 CAD total taxes and everything included My credit card was actually charged 3 separate times totalling 115600 this site is a rip off

I am out 1350 for an order of 100 face value Mercury Dimes placed in December 2016 Penn is completely unresponsive to attempts to resolve this matter Criminal prosecution is on the way for those involved with the theft and fraud perpetuated against me
While Vodafone offer a good mobile phone service to us I am less than impressed with their policy on payment extensions The most you can have is three in a year and they must not be within three months of each other and is only extended up to 14 days from the date due Why on earth someone thinks thats a good thing Ill never know Compare that to Telstra who are happy to help their customers by extending deadlines by a month or more at times and who are happy to arrange payment plans to keep you going
When someone loses their job and is without income for a few weeks these things matter Try getting a new job when your mobile is cut off And try deciding between feeding your family and paying the mobile bill
All Im asking for is some common decency and flexibility Ive been a Vodafone customer for 18 years and Im going to pay my bills guysjust help me out when I need it by giving me some time to pay
The order made it in good time but the frame was broke I had to remove the motors from one frame to the old onebad packing
You are a bunch of thieves I paid 18 on a watch and I didnt gated thieves

LE DELAIS DE LIVRAISON N A PAS ETE RESPECTER
I used We Buy Books recently to sell a bunch of CDs and books in my efforts to tidy up my flat and ended up sending them about 20 items in total largely because they didnt offer as good a price on these products as others
Initially there was much to like about We Buy Books the process is fairly smooth the communication is relatively quick and the prices offered are reasonable although they seem to make less offers on items than comparable websites
However this cant cover over the negative experience imparted once they had received my products and I got an email saying that they couldnt accept some of the CDs because of the condition they were in It seemed that the items in question were some of the more expensive ones and I was offered 2 options i Pay a fixed fee of 1 a CD for their return or ii let We Buy Books dispose of them on my behalf I asked to be sent a photo so I could assess the quality before deciding but was told they were not allowed to do this I then asked if they could combine packaging the CDs together to save on some of the postage costs as in the case of most of the CDs the postage would outweigh the value of the CD but they said they could not do this I asked if I could send a self addressed envelope with postage paid and they said they could not accept this
The only options available were to pay the exorbitant return fees hire my own courier to pick them up or come and pick them up myself although they put tough conditions on these last 2 options At one fall swoop this eliminated any benefit of sending the CDs to them a cynic might look at this as part of their business model to receive items reject them on grounds that are then unsubstantiated and then keep them for their own purposes
All in all what started well ended with a little bit of a bad taste
I placed an order for Siri in Dublin and the site said that they open for deliver at 1700 The order was placed at 1725 and I received an email and text that said the food would be delivered at 1810 I order from this place weekly as I love their butter chicken but usually order from JustEat I heard marvinie has a good loyalty program so I decided to try them Well this turned out to be a bad decision With JustEat the food arrives within 3040 minutes and arrives nice and hot With marvin the food arrived 25 minutes late so over an hour after delivery and arrived cold Thankfully I chose to pay by cash so just sent the driver away with his cold food
Disgraceful delivery service No contact with delivery service Took 1 week for 2 items to come Items left at supermarket Was never notified Absolute disgraceful
The site lagged and stuck many times and on many occasion I had to reenter info that I had inserted Bad experience especially compared for example to Eurostars seamless one
Worst company I have ever had to deal with and a bunch of thieves My torque converter went up in my 07 f250 decided to get a tc from KT Performance After asking the gentlemen 100 questions about how to install and if there are any special procedures to take They told me to install as I would an oem torque converter Never sent instructions and was told there are none Long story short KT performance ended up costing me a new transmission after their POS Torque Converter welded itself to my input shaft Called them up explained what is happening they end up sending me the instructions after burning up my transmission They proceed to tell me if I sent both converters to them they may be able to look into this First what the heck does that mean Second I would have to pay for both the converters getting down to florida where this horrible company is located Anyways havent heard a thing back from these guys the way KT performance deals with in happy customers is that they ignore you
How come this huge IKEA doing their job the worst I have made an online shopping through IKEAIT with a shipping option Today they called me and they said there is a problem of their system and Its not possible to deliver my items within 10 days So they tried to delay my shipment about 20days I live in Milano so what kind of problem they have to deliver my items in 20days People even can walk from Ikea to my house in 50mn
During the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays we made two trips for which we used Trivago to book rooms on the way out and on the way back Both times our rooms were booked 3 to 4 weeks in advance All 4 times we got to the motel to find that they did not have things that were supposed to be there like food microwave internet working fridge etc One of them we drove a 30 mile round trip off the freeway because they had a neat little bridge crossing the creek in the back yard As it turns out the bridge has been gone for 4 or 5 years When confronting staff about these discrepencies they blame in on Trivago saying they have tried several times to get these things changed or fixed Is there any reason why I should try Trivago again
First the Globe Tower 101003 Large does not have a globe on top it is a half globe So only shows the Americas the rest of the world is missing For a Globe award thats misleading
The Apex Global Award 102293 came with no globe on top as it was shown on the picture The picture not only was online but on all the emails confirming the order
The 3rd was perfect and the quality of the products is great thats why I gave them 2 starts instead of just one
I wanted to like the store because they carry some great stuff but unfortunately the customer service and warehouse management is lacking I placed an order for a sweater in size small and days later I received a message that they messed up and dont have the item in stock No apology or future discount code was given other than to say they didnt have it despite the system showed they should have had it There was no attempt or interest in gaining a loyal customer of their store
Totally disappointing experience not only were my funds helps up I didnt get the item and missed other sales from other sites in that time Wish I could have had a better customer experience Other customers have similar experiences on Yelp Beware
I ordered two New England Patriots shirts on Thursday and selected and paid for Saturday delivery The Super Bowl was Sunday Still waiting for these shirts I emailed Fanatics yesterday and the response I received was to go to their Web site to track the delivery Do not order from this Web site if you need accelerated delivery and certainly do not pay any additional charge for accelerated delivery They appear to be charging higher amounts in possibly a misleading way
Order  20100052169128776
Im an implementation manager at Epos Now and we used to use Plastek as our provider for loyalty cards for our customers Back in September we had a customer who ordered cards They were however incorrectly printed which was not the fault of Plastek but we were okayd to have them sent back and reprinted The problem we have is that we still do not have the replacement cards months later despite being approved by our main contact there to have them reprinted Here I am passing this information on to my customer telling them when they are expected to come in and then when they dont come Im the one who the customer chews out We switched to a new card provider because of service like this and maybe thats why were having so many problems getting these cards reprinted Either way the service weve had with Plastek has been and continues to be terrible
I ordered two items and one I didnt notice said ships in 68 days but i personally dont think is very clear
When I went to check out in the basket the delivery sections said delivery takes 25 business days When the email arrived it said expect the delivery in 34 business days These are generic texts and are not adjusted to reflect any delay which would be caused by one of the items in order not being in stock
If it had been made clear in the basket that the 2nd item would hold up the delivery as other online shops do I could have chosen another item
If they had made it clear in the confirmation email the estimated delivery was 810 days I could have got in touch to change my order
But because I was under the impression everything was ok and on time it wasnt until it was too late to change my order and get my item in time So I had to cancel my order and buy from elsewhere which was a shame
Although this was my mistake I think the whole thing wasnt very clear and thats why I gave a low score
I hope this helps other people shopping to be careful to take note of the shipping text under the add to basket button I hope blue tomato can update their site to make it clearer for their customers
It was very strange that my order was placed on hold until I provided in writing my billing and shipping address This is not common practice I thought the email I received was a scam especially since the website is not secure These are two reasons I will not be shopping on this website ever again
This company is full of liars cheaters and burglars Save yourself the aggrevation Do not order from here I placed my order on black Friday Nov2016 Here it is Feb 6 2017 and the order still has not been received They will not reship or refund I have been messaging them for 2 months and They led me to believe they would but I found out today they wont Please Do not place an order here
It took me over a half hour to checkout because the website kept timing out or giving me an error One of the worst online shopping experiences Ive ever had
I used the online service arranged for the packaged to be collected from our office Friday 20th Jan as I write this review it is still sat in reception apparently to be collected today 25th Jan 1150
It was I that questioned why it wasnt collected I had to inform them of their mistake through email instead of being able to communicate via phone which may have sped up the process I received an apology and their only saving grace it that it wasnt an urgent delivery
My only question is if I had not questioned why it wasnt collected at what point would they realise their incompetence
I was Quote d 6000 for a text book they claimed was counterfeit Booksruncoms idea of hassle back return included paying my own expensive shipping essentially purchasing my book back from them Waste of my time and money Very disappointed Would not recommend at all to anyone
I was expecting a parcel for the whole day No one came Next day got automatic message saying that I have to pick it up from Creditstone road I had to spend a couple of hours standing in bad traffic to get there Driver never came to my house Ive checked camera to make sure I didnt missed him I would never use their service
Seriously the amount of nonrecyclable foam in the box surrounding the box of contacts was ridiculous I wont be ordering again due to this wastefulness
The product took 1 12 months to arrive Repeated emails sent to the vendor All the responses were in Chinese telling me that the email undeliverable to that email address I finally received a response after filing a complaint with PayPal Never again will I buy anything from this website
very poor quality  extremely disappointed would never buy from eyes of india again

I collected a car from Fuerteventura airport I didnt want to pay the added insurance despite the hard sell approach and rolling of the eyes by the lady in the office I paid a large deposit on my credit card not realising that an amount of 1374 would be taken immediately Normally your details are held on file in case of any issues My refund at the end of the rental was 1298 so Im obviously not happy and will never deal with them again I should have done more research
Just had a reply from Goldcar and I was NOT offered the refund in my own currency as they tried to say No response from them either about the behaviour and selling approach of their staff
It kills me to even give 1star I sent paper work they asked for they say they never got it an cancelled my policey its near impossible to get in contact I have left several messages on there answering machine that says an agent will call you back 5 messages in the past week still no call back then Iget an email sent with my policy cancelled STAY AWAY FROM 25 PLUS
Customer care doesnt know how to handle errors from own brand and doesnt present solutions It is a shame because the products are great but the customer care experience is slow and bad Dont know how to think solution wise
I placed an order payed with credit card the amount was reserved on my card for a few days and now the credit card has been charged with the amount of the order On the site my order status is set to cancelled I cannot even contact customer support because there is no link or email address The only thing I can do with my order is to proceed to checkout again but obviously Im not that stupid since you already got my money for the order I hope youve got a good explanation and fix this because otherwise this will be the first and last time I buy from you
I asked for my gift for my wife to be delivered on Valentines day at 1000 not only did I not receive the gift at 1000 I didnt get it at all and waited around for it the entire day This really ruined mine and my wifes day Im more than unsatisfied and feel that this service made me look like a fool when others received gifts from their lives ones
Wasnt what I expected I was expecting a more firmer mat but they are just like the toy mats that daycares have in their facilities for their children to play on
They gave me tickets which did not work for a football match which I had to travel from London to Manchester for Was promised a refund today which I did no receive
They have also blocked my account
the reason to signing up for shipping forwarding service is to get multiple packages consolidated and sent to you
Not at shipito
to do consolidation you must pay for their virtual package which costs around 60 a year
thats normally ok if you get advantages with the package however you still pay the same fees as for the free account consolidation fee per package fee per package received Special request Single content photo fee Multiple content photos fee etc
more fees for paying by bank transfer credit card paypal etc THEY JUST DONT STOP CHARGING YOU FOR ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING
i have a feeling that in 2017 will charge for chatting with their support online
going to their shipping rates they are far more expensive than many adding to this the consolidation and per received package their rates are HUGELY overpriced
their online 247 support is based offshore in the philippines where support chat know the very basic and cant resolve any issues
terrible service deserves
Theyve blocked me on all social media platforms simply for sharing this review Awful company Dont risk it
I will never recommend this terrible service to anyone and they should not be able to profit off such a terrible and dangerous platform My dog was attacked by another dog while at one of their verified sitters and since the vet bill wasnt over 500 dollars they wont cover anything So much for the insurance they say they provide My dog will now live with scars from being attacked and I just want my 445 dollars back from the vet bill and a refund for the dog boarding service that wasnt performed Rover shouldnt allow a dog sitter to host more than one dog due to this risk
Not that any of this is pertinent to the claim but my dog is a 28lb well trained French bulldog who wouldnt hurt a fly He doesnt even bark at other dogs The fact that my dog was allowed to be bit not only once but 5 times shows negligence and irresponsibility by the dog sitter as well as a lack of responsibility on Rovercom for not wanting to cover the vet bill and the cost of the boarding
May this be a warning to anyone who is considering using this dangerous and unprofessional service
Insert the usual comments about the obligatory one star rating as the minimum Been well over a month since orderingtook several weeks to prepare to shipthat was apparently a true statementthere is no other possibility for why it would take over 2 weeks and counting to receive a small packagewait maybe it is being hand delivered by Prince Charming If that is the case I may have to update my rating
I had theur family head lawyer for family law he would turn up to the court late  I was always worried whether he would show up I was only eassurrd once that he would I am sure he would off but this company has no idea how stressful it is for their clients I was lead through the process was given very little actual advice Once when I asked a helping lawyer what their experience was I was told to mind my own business thats after giving them over 80 000 When I meet with my lawyer he often wasnt up to date with what I had sent so I stopped attending On fridays when they sent everything out to you often with no suggestions you rarely get hold of anyone if u rang them and you and are left all weekend with it They did give me the best barrister and when I said this to them they immediately talked about someone they just lost because of that barrister I would no longer suggest them to anyone for family law I would for wills they were great for that
Beware of the company Mengfei Zhao  I chose this company to replace my battery in my laptop The battery did not fit correctly although exact number I ordered from another company I tried to email the company 23 times with no response I then tried to have this raised through pay pal and they suggested I send back with tracking number I sent but unfortunately I lost the receipt from the post office and now pay pal has said they cannot help and the company will not reply to my emails Their email address is as I cannot seem to find any info with the above name on the internet Pay pal useless with automated answers that are no help at all

I have gotten a gym pants wich probably already been worn Very dirty and the elastic was already lose There were also ink strokes on the material I have filed a complaint on the offical website too
It took them nearly 4 weeks to sort out what frames they had in stock Twice i have had to change my order They have confirmed that the glasses are being made twice both times to come back and said that the frames are out of stock 4 weeks to work out what frames they have in stock
they take the money up front so i suspect it is useless to cancel your order as you will never get your money back on this level of service
I will buy elsewhere next time and will tell others the same
I would prefer to give a good review but in all honesty I cant I urge you not to spend your valuable dollars here
The lesson itself was taught by a blowhard who actually said I dont care what you say in a review because Ill get paid anyway
To make matters worse I have spent hours trying to claim the PDUs and have resorted complianing directly to the PMI
Go elsewhere
Frank and Nick were extremely helpful and responsive to my needs Great experience
The items i ordered were delayed for more than two months I had to keep following up with Zodee when i would be receiving them Initially i was told they were delayed then they were not dealing with the company that makes the product anymore I then had to follow up my refund but at the same time i was receiving emails about a refund i started receiving emails that my purchase had been processed and in transit I had no idea what was going on I did eventually receive my order and it was as i expected which was great However i am disappointed in the customer service i received Obviously there is a lack of processes and communication within Zodee I doubt i would use Zodee again
The flowers arrived at 630pm too late given that I specified that the address was a work address ie people leavesa at 5pm
You hired me a car in bad condition the car broke down in the middle of the road because it runs out of battery and I had to spend time asking to help on the phone and waiting for someone to help me when I dropped off the car I had to pay for the petrol I dont know why but it wasnt my fault that you hired me a car with a didnt work battery
I installed the unit as directed and have moved it several times and turn the antenna in all directions All my lights are green but the only good reception is in the same room as the inside antenna is located I will keep the unit but it is not what it is advertise to be

Ordered four sets of blinds Thirteen days ago Little did I no the material isnt in stock This didnt show on the Web site when placing my order Every time I made contact over the phone I was given a new delivery date Customer services were dreadful no apology just wanted to argue with me
Hi there
Thank you first of all for reminders for the new policy That helps
what I dont understand is why wasnt possible to be contacted by any of customer service to help me to updated my details and instead of this I am requested to contact myself I think a little service to someone who didnt stopped you to renew a contract without any problem can be done
Best regards
Didnt deliver on time I was promised 14th feb but the order was not delivered It is 15th feb today and we have still not received the order
I have ordered a bouquet of red roses for my girlfriend for Valentines
I had expected the flowers to be delivered in the morning to my girlfriends office However the flowers had not been delivered as expected
There is no tracking service online and I had to wait on the customer service line for over 20 mins to speak to a customer representative who informed me the delivery would be made at 4pm However the flowers were only delivered at 8pm to my girlfriends office which of course my girlfriend was no longer there to receive the flowers
I would at least expect the florist shop to contact myself or my girlfriend both of our details were provided when ordering to arrange for a delivery to a different address when the delivery was expected to be late
I believe the quality of the service is significantly below what I would expect as a professional service
your site would not let me go back to where I left off shopping I would of bought more if not so frustrating

Tickets were overpriced and were not received until months after purchase Communication was absolutely ridiculous Would never use again
Suite No 392710 Package No U20170126726876
The original shipment dimensions were 23178 The box was hugely oversized for the contents It could have been consolidated to 17143
But then an executive over the phone says they would keep the dimensions to a minimum of 18155 They set the dimensions accordingly in our account and we paid  90  that actually matched shipping calculator estimate 
But then the shipment was not shipped the next day  26th January   and Usgobuy account shows 34 other payment The shipping calculator could not have been wrong
The thing was that the dimensions were rather kept as 21167 Still very huge parcel with 7 inches height
We mention different dimensions and then Usgobuy executive after rejecting most agrees on one last But then again the package is not consolidated to what was agreed
We have been calling since 26th between 10AM to 5PM PST our calls are not received Nor mails being responded to
Was informed by Spotify that pincode supplied by MyGiftCardSupply was invalid Emailed twice but no response Tried another email and still no response Emailed MyGiftCardSupply via PayPal same issue It has been almost 48 hrs Still cant get hold of the customer service

Key code was advertised as Global it was not and region restricted Expected me to wait for resolution which was they would sell on the key to a customer as I already had viewed the code This had no timeline meaning I could be waiting for months before I get my money back DO NOT BUY from these fraudsters
I followed all of the steps and sent the books back in a timely manner but have to wait almost 47 weeks for the funds to come in the mail And when I did get the check in the mail it was faded and the bank could barely read the notes on the check and did not let me even cash one of the checks because it was unreadable 
I didnt receive a confirmation email and no updates on whats going on Thought i had imagined that I placed the order Remembered that I printed the receipt for FSA so I was able to figure out how to login and check whats going on Still hasnt arrived or been shipped 2 weeks after ordering

I have used this service before I received a text from Nightline to say the order had been dispatched I then received a text to say that it had been delivered to head office In the past I then receive a call from Lifestyle Head Office to say that the product had arrived in my selected store but I never received that call or text One week later I went in to the Grafton Street store and when I mentioned that I hadnt been contacted I was told that it was up to head office to ring me and it was not the fault of the store I collected my product but felt that the experience was not as good as usual
ORDERED TWO WEEKS AGO  Still awaiting the delivery of the INK to Home POOR POOR SERVICE Likely not to use you again
Further to my concerns on delivery yes it was delivered yesterday BUT there have been numerous false starts to deliversuggest you speak to the couriers you employ on  as it sounds thru their questionable communicating systems interstate offices of courier  pick up calls on deliveryno idea where the suburbs are to deliver in different states that the loading of my purchased ink has been to many  varied parts of this great state  country we live in  as it so happens had to purchase ink to sustain the printer  printing from Office works

Order was rejected because the items could be out of stock This was after a few days of the order status being in processing I had paid for 2 day delivery What is the use of any of that when it takes days to process prior to shipment and at the end of it the order is cancelled Displaying the item as out of stock during the purchase would have been better
I ordered goods last November money was taken immediately tracking number says good were in UK Customs in December nothing ever received Emails are just responded to with a reference number further emails state the matter has been dealt with Trading Standards only suggest emailing them Now waiting for my credit card company to deal with this Suspect they are now trading under a different name so beware

I was 5 times in touch with your customer service department but nothing happens
I Anvers disappointed I payed money for even Remover of Wonderbrow but you can take it off with any cheap Makeup Remover
That also means you have to do the eyebrows new every single day
I tried this app a couple of time on our trip we stayed in for hotels this trip many I booked within 3 hours of arrival and this so didnt help for any of them I got cheaper prices ekse where and quit using it after a couple of tries
I was unfortunate enough to find this company online I ordered one vertical blind and measured as per instructions given  When the blind arrived the slats had 18mm gap at the bottom and were really poor quality  I called and and was treated as if I was stupid and it was my fault before I had even explained properly I was then told to email pics of the blinds on the floor  hung up and attached to the rail  Every time my tape measure showed they were short but the arrogant staff continued to refuse to admit anything was wrong with the blinds after fifteen emails and having the phone put down on myself I was sent a doctored picture taken at an angle in bad light declaring that the blind head rail was 50mm after I had been made to send pic after pic showing the rail was actually 43mm  They are still refusing to take any responsibility whatsoever and I have now opened a complaint with trading standards
Please dont make my mistake and deal with these people ever 
Well I requested samples and never received them so I cant speak to the quality of the product but it is pretty terrible customer service
12717 Update
Shannon reached out on 126 about my samples within hours of me writing this review stating they have been shipped on 1220 and did they have my address right No proof of shipment provided Address is correct but despite their claim that the sent samples samples were never received Also I never received an order fulfillment notification the first time
We will see if they follow through this time but unfortunately this sort have start has me questioning whether I can trust them with my business
Ordered an O2 sensor and it was no good 100 down the drain Thanks
Purchased TWO Quad itemsJJRC from TOMTOP On my H36  the USB charger stopped working after about 4 charges to the battery The 2nd item  H11WH  will not connect to WiFi using enclosed instructions APP NOT able to use the camera or fly this quad via my phone JJRC manufactured these but TOMTOP NEEDS to stand behind what they sell CS took 3 weeks to respond to my emails FULLY explaining my probs  only to say Really sorry to hear that Is that possible to bother you to take a small video which can show this problem and send the video to me because the video maybe can show better  I sent PICS and TOMTOP CS then responded with the exact same message Really Appears their avoiding my simple explanation of the problems NOT getting any satisfaction from their so called customer service
Very complicated procedure with unknown outcomes to making selections I had to make lots of calls to find out what wasnt readily available or unclear in the vast terminology of instructions Phone did not work in my location in US to test if settings were right before leaving for trip When arriving overseas could not get phone to work and had to make multiple calls to One Sim to discover details of making calls that were not told to me before hand
pessima condotta
Service in store was great and the buying process was a breeze I purchased a mattress and box springs for an extremely reasonable price However delivery was shittyyyy and there was poor communication I was told it would be delivered by 1pm the following day It took for me to call them 3x after about 3pm before I got a more sufficient time Once they delivered it around 530pm they left the mattress and box springs leaning against the wall in plastic and did not assist with set up which I was informed they would set up when I purchased in store It was such a shame and a total waste of an entire day waiting around
Signed up for Energia and there was an offer on that they didnt tell me about I called back to Quote the offer but they said as I had signed up a few hours beforehand i was ineligible Great way to treat new customers Avoid at all costs Im leaving as soon as my contract is up if not sooner
Pre ordered Resident evil7 but didnt receive on release date as matter of fact i had to talk to several representatives to get it mailed After 2days of disc arrival i was supposed to receive bonus activation code BUT that didnt happen either Had to nag the representative again for what was promised The whole process was frustrating
If there is any information missing it erases all the information I have already entered Does this over and over again It behaves as though its daring me to make a mistake Also the billing address field has no place for City and State
I ordered my contacts 2 weeks ago and have not heard anything from them I checked on my order status and all it says order received
Excellent Job great Service I would highly recommend this company
Trs bien
Ce jeu prennant
I have returned my purchase a while ago now and still have not any response to acknowledge receipt
I have ordered product and recieved confirmation After 3 days the company contacted me to inform that sadly the product is not available
I tried to use it and nothing i want a refund
My girlfriend did not receive the flowers I ordered for Valentines Day
We where lied to about the pricing As soon as the contract is up we will be switching providers
My order took nearly a month to reach me I had difficulty contacting anyone at Tomtop There was no useful follow up information on my order when I looked online No information about when it would be dispatched I emailed Tomtop on a couple of occassions as suggested on their website  no reply whatsoever I had an online chat with someone on two occasions  the person said I would receive an email with an update both times No emails came despite checking my spam box I will never order from Tomtop again and I wont be recommending them
Favorite products you can buy are satisfied Thank you very much

Wanted to love it after all it has a battery charger and laptop tray perfect But the frills mean nothing if it isnt constructed well Handle wouldnt go down first trip out Second trip out the zipper broke Not worth the money at this point until they fix the table stakes items for frequent travelers
Customer service was poor submitted request and never got a response No number to call  only email I would say go above and beyond if you want raving fans We realize that its a start up but then work to fix the problems
That company was in charge of shipping an online purchase i made I was staying in Canada for almost a month and they delay so much Im leaving the country not on empty handed but also had payed extra to arrive faster When i contact them it took more than a day to pass me to someone that wasnt completely clueless about what to do even so the so called Tracing Specialist was also useless and did not help at all Never again Ill use this service also if anyone is thinking about buying at BH I suggest you rethink that its from where I placed my order they too were neither willing or unable to do anything
waited 20 minutes from the help desk to reply me after she said please wait a minute not helpfull at all also they send me delayied message to redirect me in another verification payment but pay attention in this that maybe the ticket ammount will be diffrent

Avoid Purolator at all cost if you pack your stuff by yourself I used this business a couple months ago when I had to ship my belongings to my new place When the packages were arrived most of them had noticeable damage to even outside of the boxes and it was no surprise that some pieces inside were cracked or completely broken I contacted the customer service department but they said that they wouldnt be responsible for any damage if I had personally packed my stuff Half of the packages were heavy duty cardboard boxes to give extra protection for my stuff but this horrible company wore crashed and dented those thick boxes I cant imagine how terribly Purolator treated my stuff during the delivery If you are totally okay with spending extra money on repairing your broken stuff or purchasing a new one and with being horribly treated by the customer service this business could be one of your options Otherwise you definitely want to take your business somewhere else
Product was ok But my god the customer service people on the phone were rude and treated me like an idiot when I just wanted to understand an unfamiliar process around health funds Would almost be tempted to advise friends to stay away because of this
Still waiting for my order Paid in full when I ordered and should have received my contacts but still not here Havent heard when they are shipping or if not shipping when my refund will be received
Customer care doesnt know how to handle errors from own brand and doesnt present solutions It is a shame because the products are great but the customer care experience is slow and bad Dont know how to think solution wise
just avoid this place There based in HK By the time you get any help well be Years

The parcel was ordered well in time but delivered a day too late Quite important if that day is Valentines
I am looking at all responses on behalf of Rebtel Fernando and all he resorts to is send us your bill or we can not locate your account Very good Fernando Can Rebtel not simply look at email or phone numbers to verify everything quickly why the bill I have yet to find an honest phone company You guys are all crooks and in it for the money and then run Fernando tell your bosses to be more ethical and less generic There are enough scammers in this world
Thanks
I called less than 30 minutes after booking my flight and was told that it could not be changed I had to pay 75 to cancel the reservation and then book another flight This seemed excessive since I only need to change one part of the flight and the original reservation wasnt even 24 hour old  it was more like 24 minutes old The person I spoke to on the phone was not sympathetic in the least and even got my name wrong  called me by my middle name Ive never used this service before and will never use it again
They start out saying we see this all the time and no worries we can help you Then they need A little help so they bring in someone to financially help for a cost of course You do it because you feel you have no choice then they submit applications for you In our case they submitted only 6 total applications and half of them were incorrect so a total of 3 applications went through We did receive funding but for only a fraction of what they said they could get After we received our funding that financial guy took his cut they took their cut and we got basically nothing In the beginning they would talk to you everyday and then the further everything went they would stop calling or returning calls or just not acknowledge you anymore In short horriblehorrible experience with this company lendio and they will prey on the innocent and always come out of the deal better than you
I cant even make out the picture I wanted in the glass
I have ordered from Simply oz many times and i am overall happy with the customer service and food However I have just spent a generous amount of money on my last shipment One of the items dissatisfaction tasted stale and had to be thrown out This is unacceptable I expressed my disappointment to Simply Oz I have not received any response except to fill out a survey Thanks

We rented a car through RentalCarscom at the airport in Calama Chile BudgetAvis The contract said that a deposit of US400 was needed to rent the car Here stated my nightmare with this company In my credit card appears a pending charge of US61483 not the US400 mentioned in the contract thats an overcharged of US21483 Second we already returned the car 6 days ago and my pending is still on my credit card when I was told at the BudgetAvis counter it will be release 3 days after the card has been returned We are have been in contact via email with Rentalcarscom and by phone today but received unsatisfactory answers no response yet  we need to wait 28 days  and no answer from AvisBudget in Chile and couldnt get through when they called today Im sorry this is ridiculous No follow up to their emails No followup phone calls We called the Calama Airport and got straight through AvisBudget Calama is not accepting the Rentalcarcom reference numberso we have to wait an hour for them to check and call us back Of course no one will offer to reimburse us for the international phone calls

Yesterday the January 30 2017 I bought a film from apple store in HD in 1080p Spirit of StLouis  799 what a joke it was what I will call a worn out VHS where there was a big noise from top to bottom in one part of the film Next day I wanted to see it again and to my surprise it wasnt there anymore and my order was gone I forgot to write down the order 
I found the film at Blu Raycom where it costed the above mentioned price and I see they have raised it to  1799 today with no improvement
There site on Google is not the same as when ITunes is opened all mixed up I learned that I have to write at Google the name of the film  itunes click at the film  click what resolution you want then click at the shop and you are there
So all in all it wasnt a good experience at all and it is the last time I will use it and just wave goodbye to my money
Is that the standard APPLE has at their other products that will not make me a fan
I have gotten my eldest two sites from fab kids about a year ago and they barely lasted a month Well then they charged me 2995 three different times which I had no idea that I had to buy shoes out be charged every month Needless to say I called and they could only put my money into fab kids credits so I had to order again so hopefully this time they last longer and they dont charge me anymore

Upon arrival to Premier Inn at Manchester airport on the 15th Jan there was no reservation under my name Galahotels charged my credit card and sent me confirmation several months before that date
I was trying to contact customer service number but there was only a recording with no capacity for the messagesI had to pay again for the hotel and was lucky they had a free room
I sent them several emails with invoices
Their customer service sends the same reply emails to all unhappy customers but they do not intend to resolve the case
There is a hope that publishing our experiance with them will stop people using their website

Worst thing a business could ever do This company should be taken down How dare they list your business and not give the owner the right to remove their business from their site
Automated replies from support email and they will list your negativefake reviews to the top of search results and list your positive reviews to the bottom
they also are only interested in getting your advertising dollars and not telling the true

The prices are much the same as all Travel Companies but this website is deceitful in that by default you pay for Medical and cancellation Insurance It is EASILY missed and very difficult to refunded
Offering Medical and other insurance is reasonable and an Industry Standard Opt out is not and the way you have set it up sleezy and does not promote an image of trust and professionalism
Opodos hotline is the worst customer support that I was ever in contact with It took approx 1h45min until I could reach a person that was willing and able to answer my rather easy questions even though I paid an extra fee of 999 for the socalled premium service INCLUDING preferred accessibility to the customer support At the first two attempts I had to wait approx 20min until I was connected to somebody from the hotline In both cases the connection was terminated 1min immeadiately after stating my reference number At the third attempt waiting time approx another 30min I spoke to a lady that was amazingly unfriendly and unpolite She did not let me speak out even though I kindly asked her to let me speak out When I insisted on speaking out she just hang up the phone so I needed to call the customer support for a fourth time and to wait approx another 30min This time the call center agent was able to help me The price for my flight is good otherwise I would not have booked it via Opodo However the hotline is a bad joke and that lady from the third call should be fired immediately And taking 999 for this kind of premium service is deception from my perspective
Poor service poor communication poor product
I purchased a windows 10 pro license from this company and got a license that does not work the worst company reported to Microsoft
Its the second time that I placed an order for Dainese Leather Jacket which shown as available online but after the payment they told me its out of stockn it took soo long time to get the money back n lost 30 dollars process feethis time I replied them as soon as they told me its out of stock to replace it with another one but instead they shipped other stuff without jacket n told me I can only replace it as long as I write on this comments field which mean I have to wait for one month to tell them that I wanna changethis is unbelievable n I dont wanna change to another one now plz refund me Thanks
I shipped with them to save taxes but I end up paying double what I was paying with MYUS plus the worst customer service and late shipping and late reply to my requests the order is ready to mail out 4 days after they received it and after 2 days the carrier DHL returned my order back to them as missing something then another 4 days to be ready to ship it again and again missing documents so TNT has to wait 5 days to get the required paper and finally the order delivered after one month of having it while it just takes 34 days to get it delivered to the final destination in Canada with MYUS I will never deal with SHIPITO again and will stay with MYUS for now

The most horrible feeling in my life I really felt like a criminal When we were at the event the stewards there told us that the real price of the tickets was 9but ticketbis took us more than 400 I felt like in action moviethey said not to ask anyone for help thats how he they will be safe and I will be safe too It was awful Dont be the next victim The stewards said that the best place to buy tickets are firstly not online but if you dont have any other chance just use the official websites of the FC There were a lot of people like us Dont be next victim
Having spent over 230 on a jacket last August it arrived and wasnt as expected I returned it and was offered a gift card as I was outside of those unusually harsh 21 day period Its been nearly 6 monthsl their staff lied about VAT ans accounting rules to try and make me accept the gift card and have suggested I buy someone a gift with my credit Ive never been so insulted by a company I will never deal with them again and suggest no one else does either
I was not informed about a cancelled booking When I tried to do online CheckIn one day before my flight I suddenly found out that my flight is deleted When contacting Travelgenio they told me that they informed me The Email with the information started like this WE ARE PLEASED TO INFORM YOU THAT YOUR BOOKING HAS BEEN CHARGED AND ISSUED CORRECTLY
So they told me to talk with the airline company to search another flight which I would have to pay extra Finally I found another flight and cancelled my booking on travelgenio Never again
They should have only items on the website that they have in stock I wait it 2 weeks for mines to arrive
The female I spoke with on the phone would not answer the question Am I calling the hotel or a second party

I booked a car at Lanzarote airport through Auto Europe and had paid Auto Europe for the hire No problems with the booking or picking it up and the staff were really helpful
I didnt buy the extra excess insurance as I bought my own  its generally cheaper
When getting the car the operator told me I would be charged for a full tank of diesel which worked out at 46 I was then promised that any unused fuel would be refunded All very good I thought
So when I dropped off the car at the airport in the multi storey car park to another operator there I showed her how much was left in the car It was 25
I was expecting a refund of about 11
Instead when I checked my credit card they had taken a further 43 out off of my card the one which had had 1100 locked off as a deposit
I tried phoning but the Goldcar operator from the UK when I returned home could not clearly explain why the second amount had been taken out without my permission
I had to contact my credit card to explain what had happened and got the amount refunded by the credit card company
I would advise to be very careful when booking with this company  and even warn that if possible to avoid
Oh and the car was in exactly in the same condition on return as when I collected it
For your reference Goldcar the contract was 10979615 if you want to look into this with your right to reply Look forward to the reason why
I placed an order and paid by creditcard In the orderdetails it was still awaiting payment I payed again and it was still awaiting payment Then I got an email

I wrote to them stating that i cancelled my order Still havent heard from them
FAKE SITE 
The books were in great shape and they came quickly Very happy with cost and service I recommended to a friend and she was happy too

Not given the chance to except or decline the Gap insurance which I ALREADY HAVE not given an option on the GPS and not given an option on the over 2600 charge that was added on When one has bad credit sometimes we are at the mercy of the dealership The 5 day return part is great unless like me an unexpected situation happens and makes it impossible to get there in time along with reading the 56 page contract
Desperate times call for desperate measuresdo Ill pay for it especially since there will be NO WAY to refinance it with those 3 added charges
There is absolutely no way I could recommend drive time to anyone Wished I would have went across the street to McKinneys I know now that they could have helped me a whole lot better than drive time Gastonia NC

My flight with flight hub was cancelled due to weather I phoned to ask for a reimbursement for my flights and they kept giving me the run around They told me I had to deal with the airline company not them So I phoned the airline company and sat on hold for 40 minutes so they could tell me no I had to deal with flight hub So back to flight hub they told me the same thing So I phoned the airline company again and sat on hold for another 40 minutes before they told me no contact Flight Hub On the third time phoning flight hub I spoke to a lady and asked her to talk to the manager she was great she asked what was wrong I explained the situation to her she got the airline company on the other line and straightened it all out with all three of us on the phone It took a total of 4 hours straight phoning back and forth Not very customer friendly with the first two employees arguing with me on the phone but the third was awesome
Got a foreign voice and they werent knowledgeable about my area Kept trying to put me in wrong area size and price range
Before Christmas I paid for an iphone 6 unlock under the hopes that it would be sorted in the weeks after
After chasing iPhoneIMEINet I was informed that
Sorry but iPhone unlocks are done through the carriers and at this time we are facing delays with there service which is effecting all the customers globally at this time they are coming back but in drips and drabs
Now two months after the purchase I was sent a request for more money worded
Additional Funds Required
The price we are charged by the carrier has doubled but as a previous client we are NOT passing the cost onto you We just ask you to cover our costs we make no profit on your unlock
93 retail  66 credit  27 remaining
100 Guaranteed Unlock
Unlocking has resumed on a limited time service which is guaranteed but additional funds are required in order to process your unlock as the price the carrier charges to unlock has increased Please ensure you make this payment speedily before the service goes offline this is a onetime only submission
Right  Ill have to leave it here as I have to rush now to pay those additional 27 
After a much deserved payment heres what this site had to say

I purchased a pair of sunglasses gift this is a gift not for me and even it it was for me they should have a case to place the glasses in Well i received the order in a plain box no case to it and now i cant give my gift to the person i had purchased for I think the customer should be informed or it should say no case or something on the order Then i called customer service and their answer was that they will check and get back to me well i am still waiting and no answer Horrible customer service I will never purchase here again
Made an order and it was not sent why dont know figure thay dont want the business 
I have tried to contact them through Livechat phone and email and I have ever received a response When I called it was an automated messenger that said it could understand full sentences but it couldnt so I sat on the phone for 20 minutes trying to get it to transfered to a real person When I finally did the man was very rude to me and told me that the leggings I ordered but got canceled without them even telling me must have been out of stock and I should just try ordering them again I didnt receive an email notifying me that my order was being cancelled and I didnt hear a sorry from anyone for the lack of communication I have tried all of the ways available to contact someone but I never get a response My friend also just told me that she ordered the 2 for 24 leggings and they took 11 days to come in and only one was delivered and she cant get ahold of anyone in the company to inform her of when they will be there This is easily the worst customer service I have ever experienced I have given them many chances to contact me and they never have so if anyone wants to order athleticwear I would definetly not use this site if you actually want to receive it without hassle
I bought an item on eBay and sent it to my us for them to ship to the uk I have them the declared value I waited 2 days and then they closed my account They refused to tell me how they returned the package to the eBay seller I need that package I paid good money for it I opened a case 3 days ago they said it would take 2 days max But they never replied Use another service AVOID this shipping service at all costs
The bike is good no complaints there The customer service experience and the assembly by the inshop mechanic left a lot to be desired though a monkey with a hammer would have done a better job
Ive ordered a few blinds over the past few years but the quality and service is not what it used to be Ordered 2 rollers and 2 Venetian blinds last July One roller came wrong size measurements were correct and the cord in one the Venetian blinds was worn through when came out of box It all got fixed after sending photos etc In November ordered 2 Vertical blinds one that would draw over to the left and the other that would split in the middle Waited 10 days for delivery local guy would have been quicker Im sure and when they arrived both blind rails had middle splits instead of one to the left Screws brackets and child cord safety loops were missing This was after getting emails that blinds were made and going through quality checks Phoned up had to send pictures etc and they said they would express make another rail and send out the missing pieces 2 days later got screws brackets and child safety loops but it was another 10 days before rail arrived Took longer than original order Express Now 4 months later the vertical blind with the middle stacks rail clicks really loud and gets stuck when trying to turn the blinds I have other vertical blinds from them in the house that work fine and quality is superior I think in the strive to be cheap they have let quality slip Its a shame because they used to be a good fast service
First time using the site and I have to say its very poor Dates keep changing and it sounds like I am just being fobbed off Terrible site and I wont be recommending it to anyone I have asked when my cash back will be available but every time another week gets added on I only switched due to the offer on the site as it worked out cheaper but so far has cost me more money than my previous provider I will make sure to let as many people know as I can that it is not worth using this site Very poor customer service and more and more this just feels like a scam site I have been waiting since Dec 13th but no resolution or payable date I just get sent marketing emails asking saying Hey weve got your cash back yeah I bet they have but their not giving it to me Total scam
Very frustrating experience with Airtasker The website was extremely slow not due to my internet connection as I tried using it on different computers with different net connections and continually failed at the final confirmation step
Then when I finally received confirmation I thought it was all done but then my tasker got in contact with me to tell me that the task hadnt been confirmed yet
To their credit Airtasker did resolve the matter once I raised the problem but the overall experience was very frustrating and slow
The insurance option requires one to opt out the default is to accept insurance After opting out of insurance and submitting the reservation an error notice indicated that I had omitted the credit card threedigit security code I supplied the security code and resubmitted the reservation
Upon checking the reservation total I found an additional 36332 for the insurance premium A glitch in the FlightHub system reinstates the insurance with every error message This is an unacceptable practice by FlightHub I immediately called FlightHub to reverse the charge however it should never have been added in the first place
Just bought 2 tickets for darts for 3 arena in dublin in April they should have cost 60 each that 120 made the mistake of buying from this company sent me to English site cost wait for it  265 plus o conversion fee of 5 euro  270 for tickets worth 120 how has this company not been sued STAY CLEAR STAY CLEAR RIP OFF
These bags always arrive on time and the order is always correct
Thanks for your good service
Luckily there are plenty of other betting sites to pick from
From the minute go this was a nightmare Took nearly a month just to get my own deposited money back off them AVOID
I made a booking today for travel tomorrow but only after Id received the confirmation email did I realise I had already made the booking for the same train on this site a couple of months ago
Of course this was my mistake but since I had booked two tickets for the same identical train with the same identical passenger names and the same identical email address you would have hoped that the site might have noticed
As it stands I refunded one set of tickets and had to pay a 10euro penalty
So while it was my stupidity that was entirely to blame I just wish the site could have helped me out a bit
This company has been absolutely horrible to deal with Im currently stranded overseas with no return flight because of a mistake they made The only way they will work on the change is if I pay an additional 400 after my ticket has already cost me 2500 They wont admit to their mistake and are trying to put tge blame on me Not to mention I have spent the last 16 hours on and off the phone with them only to tell my story 8 times being told they were going to do something about it and call me back and then not call me back Then I called back and l was back in my original position of them not doing anything WORST COMPANY EVER They have lied to me about them sending me emails each person I talk to gives me a different story and they have told me that there is no one higher in the company to deal with and then hung up on me
Disapointed because of the digital part not very visible
I ordered a 160 Lenovo Android phone that arrived with the package retaped and the contents empty There was a phone box inside but the box contained no phone no charger no cables When I asked for my money back from FCT I was told to get a nonexistent form from the US Post Office to declare that the phone was stolen which USPS does not do I had USPS send back the box with an empty contents sticker but FCT still would not refund my money DO NOT USE FCT
I ordered a radiator part and was sent wrong product After 4 weeks and 4 phone calls still no refund I complied with taking a picture of part order number etc I have NEVER DEALT WITH A WORSE COMPANY My lawyer will be contacting them within the week Evidently they keep your money even though they receive the returned part Horrific experience
I would never trust travlopod and never ever book my flights again There were tickets available for less than 1000 and i got a ticket for 1500 dollar i just trusted travelopod blindly This is so bad and broken the trust
Management please reach out to me if you need any clarifications further I will try to post in all my social networking site if this is not resolved
probably will not purchase again
Forget what you have seen on TV and what you have read on the internet This service is a complete waste of time I had already started the process of refinancing with another company and was curious about Let Banks Compete Over You I signed up and I was absolutely bombarded with phone calls Not one of them were professionally enough to leave a voicemail Can you imagine being at work and going into a meeting and seeing numerous missed calls all from areas you dont recognize Occasionally I would receive a call back from one of these numbers and I would immediately say You were not professionally enough to leave me a message so therefore I am not interested in anything you have to offer
All this service does is take your personal information and distribute it to countless vendors Be prepared for numerous phone calls at anytime of the day Regardless of time zone and emails especially when all you wanted to do was inquire While writing this review I just received another email about Better Mortgage Rates because of this service when I have been closed for 2 months with my original company Stay AwayStay Far Away from this site
I bought a bike jacket but it was badly made  I tried to get the refound but nobody helped me  I spoke so many time with the costumer Center but it was a redicoulous monologue

Car had not been refuelled on pick up but we did not realise until the petrol light came on later that night Raised this when returning vehicle but were simply told it could not be the case We could not prove what had happened so received no compensation Requested manager investigate but never heard anything back Will not use Redspot again

Very poor communication My purchase did not arrive in time for Valentines day the surprise was totally ruined The worst service ever And No one gave a dam I want a full refund
Do not use these people Be warned
Clothes on the site are very cute but the sizes and stylecolors that I want are never in stock
Nicht akzeptabel
I have emailed them regarding the use of my email address and never heard from them again Poor service
prices arent as competitive as in the past
Using the internet I purchased a set of valves from eFaucets They appeared to be the correct ones by the picture eFaucet had on there site In size  shape and everything  When I got them they were the wrong ones I called to find out how to exchange them for the correct ones I was told that exchanging would cost me more then the parts cost so id lose money To me they should fix there site to better represent the part so customers like myself will not order the wrong part because they are miss represented in the picture
Excellent quality perfect fit
Order made 121616 for delivery by Christmas No show Called left message No response Called again closed for Christmas till early January Called again after holiday left message no response Called 4th time 11617 got a real person for the first time Said order was pending but she would ship today Order received a week later My first experience with this company Really felt this outfit was a sham and would have lost my money Regardless didnt have what I needed for Christmas business
updating the drivers was easy once i figured it out however since i did the drivers and optimized my computer it has been running slower then mnormal not sure if it is the computer or the internet s provideri am just happy to have the drivers fixed
Total a ruse whatever they did didnt work plus I had to give my new password Wont pay this
Terrible service from Euroflorist for several reasons The flowers I ordered for 140217 were not delivered on the day and still have not been delivered I sent an email to Euroflorist Belgique asking why the delivery failed but have had no reply and when I try calling the phone number the line doesnt connect I will continue to reach out to Euroflorist and expect a full refund because this service is unacceptable
The telephone number 8005123733518 is a loop push 1 or 3 and you get a We are Very Busy push 2 and the entire message repeats itself There have been no to responses to my simple question My next step is to cancel payment for this service
They are bunch of lying people their workers does not know what they are talking about I use this site a lot for my traveling but this time I needed to change my time of departure They sent a email saying I have two hours to change my mind because it is not confirmed yet So me needing to change the time called the contact number but the stupid horrible rude worker kept on saying I had to pay the cancellation fee Then they did not send the department after I forwarded the email to him After I pinned down the facts he just blamed the other department  After arguing for an hour he said sorry two hours has passed which means that I was right and I shouldve got my money back and I still want my money back because this is a scam and bunch of bull CRAP This company is full of CRAP and does not AGREE WITH THEIR OWN TERMS and I would never recommend it and use it again
After purchasing tickets six months prior to the show Book of Mormon Melbourne I was contacted in the last week to say my Dress Circle seats were no longer available  and heres four seats sorry had to split you in the back rows of the Stalls No financial compensation either for the dreadful seats We were separated from friends  absolute debacle Never never again would I use Ticketmaster Resale and Im telling everyone I know If there was a 0 star rating thats what Id give
And yes we did accept the alternative tickets offered  because we had already paid for airfares from Queensland and accommodation in Melbourne
This company is fraud I am sure for my experience that I have sent more than 8 mails and I was been waiting for 2 weeks for the 30 pound product which is fine as it is not that expensive but still feel like they are shing me and treating me like nothing DO NOT BUY ANYTHING IN THIS WEBSITE YOU WILL GET NOTHING
The vouchers take ages to come through and most cannot be for 15 or less
I ordered three books Two were 359 and one was 506 The two books were in way better condition than the 506 one The 506 one had loads of markings on it and the thriftbooks sticker tore off some of the side Meanwhile the other two books had minimal wear It bums me out because I was really excited for the 506 one I find it to be unfair that the cheaper books were in better condition than the 506 when one of the cheaper ones said it was in acceptable condition while the 506 was said to be in good condition I would have been okay with this if the thriftbooks sticker didnt ruin the side of the book Im going to shop on other sites from now on 
My first few orders went fine delivered within the stated time period I had to get the box delivered on a Saturday though as they only offered day time deliveries on Tuesdays and I didnt want the box to sit out all day when I was at work Most meals were fantastic with only a couple I wouldnt make again
Then new delivery times were offered and I was glad to change to a weekday morning delivery The whole point of the service for me anyway though I would imagine the large majority of customers is convenience and I have less time on workdays to think about and shop for meals than I do on the weekend My delivery time was set for Monday between midnight and 7am 700 came and went no box I was in a bind  was the box just running late or was is not coming at all The temperature that day was 39 degrees and I couldnt really risk it sitting out while I was at work So I tried calling Marley Spoon but there was no one to answer the phone I sent them a message on facebook noting they were stated to have excellent response times I continued waiting until after 8am when I had to leave for work Late to work missed a meeting it was not until after 9am when I was contacted back on my message saying that customer care would shortly be in touch
I followed up after 12 as I had still heard nothing At about 1315 I was told that the truck had broken down While I appreciate that accidents happen there should definitely be a system in place to inform customers Had I received a text from them during the delivery time I would not have minded As I receive a text and photo when the box arrives there is clearly a way for the drivers to contact people
Sue from customer care phoned approximately 30 minutes later She said a fresh box would instead be delivered the following day in the midnight7 timeslot I was offered a 23 discount off my next box Then just after 4pm I received a text from them confirming there had been a problem with my box so helpful a mere 9 hours after the end of the delivery period and the box would be delivered tomorrow
So it came as quite a surprise when an hour later a box arrived at my door It was still 36 degrees outside and it had clearly been in an unrefrigerated van as the contents are hot There was fortunately a tiny bit of ice left in the cold packs but had I not been home and there was no reason I should have been after all it had only been an hour since I had been told the box and a new box not the box sitting in a broken down van the entire incredibly hot day would be delivered the next day the contents would have been unusable
I again queried Marley Spoon about my issues with their systems  it seemed that the office had zero idea what their delivery team is doing In addition both my sisters had signed up on my recommendation and neither of them had received their days boxes at that point either I was again told that customer care would be in contact shortly I heard nothing back though noted in my account that I had been provided a free box for the following week
Then Monday morning I was back in the exact same situation 7am came and went and again I had no box This week it was only 36 degrees but not a temperature you can leave perishables out in So again I was late to work and still had no groceries I contacted MS again I was without a box and they had never responded to me last week I was told that they would be in touch shortly Lunchtime again rolled around with no contact I followed up I then received a call from Sue again She spent the entire phone call talking about the previous week She said she had sent me an email and then read it out I accepted that she had sent it however it had not arrived She casually noted that oh yes I see your delivery today is still marked as pending  but acted as though it is completely fine to not deliver when they say they will She forwarded me the email and said she would follow up with that days box and get back in touch
Again the email noted that my box had not arrived but said nothing more about it I followed up this email several times throughout the afternoon but I literally have not heard from them again since That evening I was out and received a text at 1845 stating my box had arrived When I got home 10 minutes later there was nothing at my front door I checked the photo with the text and realised it was a photo of someone elses box at a different house It belonged to a house 2 doors up my street I immediately phoned MS but of course could only leave a message I left a message and sent another email Slightly over an hour later my box arrived The delivery guy told me a separate truck had delivered my neighbours box and had accidentally claimed to have sent mine So there is definitely some sensible delivery techniques happening here  houses literally metres apart are being serviced by different drivers
When I opened my box I discovered the ice in the meatdairy packs was completely melted Although the van had been refrigerated this time my box had clearly been out all day since before midnight presumably and again if I had not been home it would not have lasted long outside I have contacted MS several times since and all of my correspondence has gone unanswered My sisters box arrived more than 3 hours late yesterday and she has also not received any response from her queries I am honestly completely astonished that a company would act this way You would think that a company that exists to provide a service that is almost entirely based on convenience would be able to deliver within a SEVEN HOUR period Its not like they say your box will arrive at 6am on the dot They give themselves seven hours and are still incapable of managing it
So while the food is good it is not worth the hassle Marley Spoons customer service and deliveries are so bad that all it will do is raise your blood pressure Use hello fresh  they at least can deliver on time
I first heard about Candy Club from a good friend of mine and one of my favorite YouTubers was talking about her candy from here So I chose the buy three get three deal for first time users My first box took about twothree weeks to get to my house which is perfectly fine but I did not get a single candy I wanted All six were wrong I emailed Candy Club and they were very great about making sure Im happy and sent me a new box with the original order Well I received my second box that was supposed to replace my other candies and what do you knowmy order was wrong again Im a little bothered by it and was thinking that surely they wouldnt mess my order up a second time I figure that I pay a good amount of money for candy so I at least want exactly what I ask for I definitely will not be buying again 
It never fails when stopping at this Location Cabazon California Seminole Dr our order can be simplebut gets ignored and they give us our drinks however they feel fit Ive spoken to the store manager and he agreed my order wasnt correct My theorybecause its open 24 hours and a travel center locationthey figure by the time youve noticed your order is wrong youre on the freeway and arent turning back Its only this particular Starbucks that Ive had a problem with you bring it to their attention and the workers are annoyedREALLY GET it together people
Another company that cannot organise their deliveries I was told 5 times that the blinds were to be delivered given tracking details and time slots Each time the blinds failed to arrive I organised for a fitter to come and each time had to a cancel him He lost potential earnings and I was left making yet more phone calls both to the delivery company and Blinds2Go Eventually the blinds were recalled and reshipped It is a case of sixth time lucky never again I

The drawer badly sticks and attempts to get the drawer on track do not work
Was wrongfully charged 170 for a dent that was already on the car and was charged TWICE for the fuel One word for anyone thinking of using this firm DONT
My phone is still locked I paid for a USA unlocked and its now unlocked for outside the USA
the different mats were different thickness the only thing customer service did for me was send shims for the mat
This company advertises false low pricing to get customers via Google search but then adds a random processing fee at very end of checkout process so that final price is actually higher than most other online contact lens stores Really disappointing and does not NOT foster good feelings in customers such as myself
The price of the flight that I book was 20000 Dollars more than the original price on the website when you check out they charged over a thousand dollars more after you book so just be very careful with this company you cannot get any refund even though you call them back right away

Mistake made on booking  no one available for help

Probably write their own reviews from some internet cafe
A joke
Ordered food at 715expected delivery time was 8pmdid not receive food until 9pmdelivery man blamed restaurantrestaurant didnt carenot good
Went to buy my GF a hoodie for Christmas The Item never came the tracking was janky My item never came I had been in communication with them for months for a simple refund of 1500 no bid deal It was a nightmare to deal with customer service and FOUR months later they finally attempt to resolve this issue by offering me a 50 refund Then blaming me for the issue Thats insulting
800 thats all they had to give up to make things right But no they wanted to make money of of giving me nothing The quality of their items look so bootlegged I wouldnt be surprised if the hoodie costed them a 150 to make So they profited of of giving me nothing I walked away from Sammydress feeling punished for doing business with them
I ordered 2 tires but only one was in stock Because the original order was over 50 the shipping was supposed to be free Free shipping is a big deal when I look for online stuff You charged me for shipping on the single tire since it was only 35 Seems unfair when I ordered 2 To me this was your problem not mine Shipping should have been free My query concerning this was answered with the 50 free shipping rule
Update  days 3 of review 9 februari finally they ship my item
will update rating after the parcels arrived
UPDATE  days 2 of review 8 februari finally i got reply but unhelpful at all
they said indonesia is risk but not explained why it is risk
for iraq what they wrong before i believe there is risk but i have use my address before and no problem and i paid using WEBMONEY which is cannot be disputed if they trying to pull this scam to me
1week and 2 weeks still counting till when they ship my item
U20170128726994  have not shipped for 2 weeks now when emailed them they only said like another reply below my post  we have contacted warehouse staff to ship it out as soon as possible but still no updates
last time they said the delay is because i need to post 50 USD more for shipment to IRAQ all my shipment is going to INDONESIA and i double check that the order is really going to INDONESIA NOT IRAQ
U20170124726737  order not shipped for 1 week now and the reply of email  we have contacted warehouse staff to ship it out as soon as possible just like many another of their reply in this trustpilot review
they said their hotline is from 1000 AM to 1700 PMPSTMondayFriday see their reply at another post of another review
guess what i called today monday at 10AM 1018AM 1019AM 1020AM 1030AM 1100AM 1103AM and many times other even until 1138  no response at all said that person that you trying to reach is not available WOW
they only answer via email asking to deposit more money and with these words we have contacted warehouse staff to ship it out as soon as possible
one week and 2 weeks are not common for repackaging and shipping item because when i used their service to ship to my USA customer it only took 12 days
i am verified user i used their site for more than 10 shipments all shipped succesfully within 12 days
and now they treat me their customer like this for largeexpensive shipments BE CAREFUL IF THEY ASKED FOR MORE MONEY LIKE MY CASE ABOVE 12 weeks no update then suddenly ask money because they said my package showing iraq as address when it should be deliver to indonesia system fault what 
I WILL UPDATE THIS POST IF THEY ARE REALLY SHOWING GOOD FAITH INSTEAD THEY AUTOMATIC TEXT like this we have contacted warehouse staff to ship it out as soon as possible
Ordered a 15 item on Jan 5  today is Jan 30 Still not here Web site shows BACK ORDERED If Easy Comforts is just a warehouse hub for stuff coming from Korea they should say so on their web site so people know it will take WEEKS AND WEEKS for your order to arrive
And then to ask us to review their company BEFORE you get your order is really rich
Avoid these folks Unless you are going on a 30day cruise and dont expect your order for a month or so
Ordered a watch for Christmas i was told 48 weeks They told me it would be closer to 4 weeks I called at the 4 week mark and was told to email for updates She never responded to any of my emails I called at week 5 and was told 2 more weeks and that I would receive an email within 2 days with accurate delivery status I never received an email I called at week 6 and was told an additional 4 weeks minimum When I explained I was told 2 weeks the week prior Joma explained the person I spoke to was new and I was misinformed How hard is it to get a Michele watch delivered
I booked a trip with Invited home via Homeaway Homeaway Corporate told me I would receive a refund for my deposit since my cancellation was I 5 months in advance of the travel dates Invited Home refused to refund my deposit They are not customer oriented and are difficult to engage in solution based discussion I would not recommend them or use them again to travel
I had asked for my voucher to be sent to me in the form of a card voucher I had to ring again two months later as they had not arrived Eventually I got it sorted I hope as I am still awaiting them

Hi Patrick
Our florist confirmed he was going to deliver the flowers and we didnt receive any news about any problem so they should have been successfully delivered
However as we dont have a realtime update on the status we will contact you as soon as we receive any feedback from our florist
Kind regards
Aleksandra
FloraQueen Flowering the World 
Four days after the expected delivery this is what they send
In short we are requesting a full refund via paypal
In the future we will try to use another more trusted service over Floraqueencom this company literally has gone downhill unfortunately On another order The florist admitted to taking Half of the chocolates they were supposed to delivery so the recipient only had 6 pieces of chocolates which was supposed to be a Large box and Floraqueen had the audacity to say that is how its suppose to be
My headset had audio problems so I decided to call support to get a repair done First guy was one of the nicest and informational customer support out there I got my headphones BUT when I sent them I guess he forgot to tell me not to put the cable in which I put it in incase it was the cord that caused the sound not to work so when the repaired headset I was missing the audio cable so now I had to do the process over again This time I was connected to a man that was very irritated and just made it a lot harder to get my aux cable back very rude not actually trying to help me kind of just trying to do his job and go home
The customer service is awful The sizes are extremely small If you want to return you have to pay more than what you pay It sucks They are not helpful Order no DLNT309U1 terrible just wasting money
Never has it been so hard to buy a game After what mustve been close to 100 tries to get a payment go through and failing without any good reason behind it and when I was finally able to buy it using the same paypal accountcard with all the failed attempts it got put on manual auth and of course the missed their own within 2 hour mark for getting it through and yes this was within their office hours Last time Im ever going to use this service
Edit to answer the reply  Then explain why 1 Could purchase from Steam with the same paypal accountcard in the same timeframe 2 Why the bank confirmed no issues between them and Paypal and 3  Why Paypal claimed no issues on their end
4  When did I get a new payment source Still the same cardaccount as I always use for online purchases
I ordered a pair of progressive bifocals took awhile to get but not bad When they arrived I really did not like them felt they were to big my fault and I felt the bifocal was a little to high Decided to take advantage of their 30 warranty and send them back for an exchange Got my return number and proceeded to remove the glasses from my head and the right arm snapped in to Now I have been wearing this frame for years with no problems and I dont think I was aggressive in removing them So I called right away and was told that my account was noted and send them back I sent them back took forever I called and a lady said that the came in and were inspected and they were found to have been man handled my word and the warranty was void did they ever think could it possible be a bad frame  So I asked that they not send them back and have someone call me on Monday to discuss No one every called they were shipped back to me Someone could have called to make an offer to at least fix them but no About a week after receiving them I got an email offering to fix them at my cost By this time I had ordered a part from someone else I sent a email with my issues and have yet to here back End of story
I have waited over one week
Bravofly agents are lying to me saying that the Garuda Indonesia arlines wants to cancel my tickets which is not true Garuda Indonesia left message in the booking on line 181920 bravofly agents says they cant see any message with the name to contact to and Garuda agent told me that I have to insist bravofly must contact Garuda on the phone number 0 203 770 9661
at the airport it takes five minutes to sort out situation like this so I dont understand why it takes more than a month to fix this
Ok products sometimes defective good prices but bad support
It was explained to me that my bills would be cheaper if i opted for direct debit paper less ect But month on month my bills have been higher
I am not going to get into all what this company did however I will say this is a SCAM Order from your local florist I never got the flowers that were ordered for me and 18 separate phone calls to customer service didnt help the situation either They are a joke and need to be shut down Awful customer service and overall just an awful company
Te lange levertijd
I mentioned already i need to have it and the fact you dont offer it is a risk of my experience as i have no idea how i will get 2 booster seats with back
nobody answer the phone no email replied havent got shoes for 2 weeks
The supporters do not speak well english and allways ask the same question so itS a never ending story
will never buy again
and by the way they are paying customers to give them a great Feedback which in my mind is illegal
Everything was great when i got the storage unit the lady that helped was really awesome but a couple nights later when i went to put my stuff in storage it was so dark and i went to turn on the light in the unit and it didnt work Then I just by chance i had another new bulb on me so I changed the bulbs only to find out it still didnt work so we were trying to load the unit with no light at all Very disappointed
all the employees made me feel like garbage Making jokes about how much I had to spend and what I was looking for Will never come back again
I visited a Home Zone and was Quote d a price for a mattress When I returned and was ready to purchase the salesman mentioned the same exact price As I am reviewing my receipt after my 2700 purchase I notice that the mattress was priced higher When asking the salesman about it he said there was nothing he could do it was a system glitch But on my receipt it clearly listed the retail price and then the price that it was sold to me for was HIGHER He clearly should have fixed the price but he seemed very uninterested after he made the sale I will let everyone around know about their pricing tactics
I was s worried after reading reviews that my outcome would be the same as everyone elses and guess what It was This company is horrific They should be shut down I dont get how they are still allowed to even function Please do not book ANYTHING with these horrible people  I shouldve done my read each and reviewed them before I decided to book with them I spoke to a rep and informed him that I was a bit leery of using them bc of their horrible reviews and he assured that nothing would go wrong and that I would be ok with my flights Low and behold  The couldnt confirm my booking and the airline still has the flight available And they still have my money I will have American Express deal with them They are good at detecting fraud and these people are fraudulent Never again

Ordered 2 Tshirts for the superbowl over a week in advance 1 of the shirts was shipped  the other shirt was guaranteed to ship by Wednesday February 1st Of course the shirt has yet to ship and its half way through the day on February 2nd I ordered these in plenty of time for my family to have them for the superbowl now only one person will have their shirt in time and the other will be left out I tried contacting Fanatics for an answer  of course all I get back is a generic answer that doesnt satisfy my question I paid full price for these items  gave this company plenty of time to fulfill my order in a timely manner I am REALLY disappointed  I will not be ordering from this company again in the future
The SelfStoragecom showed that the facility had a covered RV spot to rent We reserved that spot We never heard from the facility so following the reservation instructions we called the facility They apologized said they did not have a covered rv spot available only an open uncovered spot They also said they were not affiliated with SelfStorage The facility people were very nice and helpful but the out of date online information provided by SelfStoragecom was misleading and disappointing
If i could choose 0 stars i would have Horrible customer service They do not respond to emails If you buy from them use PAYPAL so you can file a claim and possibly get a refund
Do not cheat people with fake prices

I ordered a barbour jacket with Country Attire When it arrived it had obviously been worn as there was a credit card and lipstick in the pocket When I phoned Country Attire they said it was the last one in my size so I would need to keep it or return it I returned the jacket and then had to chase up my refund Very disappointing experience
Does not deliver paid merchandise form warehouse to store for pickup as promised to the customer Very disappointed in customer relations on part of management
Yea I ordered a Rack and pinion because they had the best price
Then within two hours decided I did not need itOn a Saturday So I called every thing sounded good cancellation was awaiting approval
They said could take as long as 48 hours so I waited Inquired about the cancellation to be told it had shipped
Received email with UPS tracking check tracking information UPS scanned packed at 130 PM Monday Carid had over 30 hours to cancel the order and failed to do so to make it worse they will not refund original shipping cost of 2289 were happy to wave return handling of 900 
So I am out 2289 for something that they clearly FAILED to accomplish
I am waiting another 24 48 hours to process the return then assuming return shipping label reach me via email and once item is returned I should be receive a refund
After having to call to get RMA which was delayed at supplier and item was returned they refunded full amount as stated
Dissapointed with the price Was promised supply would be much cheaper than airtricity but have found them more expensive
They didnt deliver After 5 days and contacting PayPal myself to get my money back they offered refund I agreed Instead they delivered the flowers They didnt want to give my money back just the delivery
After asking why they even offered refund they said I get my money back in 7 days but the flowers will be picked up again
I wanted to send happiness This company is just giving frustration Never order there
I love DH gate and there are some really good sellers on there but it is a pain in the a if you get something defective or if there something that goes wrong they expect you to pay to ship all your items back and they will repay you for the shipping they say But if the shipment gets lost or damage youre screwed Doesnt matter if you ordered white Tshirt and they sent your pink Tshirts you still have to pay That is some terrible business practices
Some of the worst customer service on the planet at this place if you ever try to contact them they are useless
But like I said there are some killer deals on there so its kind of hard to avoid using it kind of like Ebay but worse
Here is a video of what the defective cartridges do
search this number at youtube hX3HGUfaBMM  trust pilot does not allow direct links
Pretty obvious they are defective if you ask me but yet I am still responsible for shipping them back going to cost me a couple hundred dollars but they will repay me so they say Very hard to trust them however
PO number is 335117224
To make things worse now they have made it to where I cannot pay with a credit card to buy from legitimate sellers on dh gate Who is the victim here Theyre making me feel like a criminal when the reality is you are letting a seller vaperguider02 rip people off

The item arrived I read the instructions then went to setup nothing happened then it started continued with setup worked for 2 mins then stopped and will not work again all requests to replace have been ignored
DO NOT BUT FRIM TOMTOP ALL THEY WANT IS YOUR MONEY
Bad service takes forever to get a hold of someone plus it is way less than i expected too much money for nothing
Very very very expensive
I did not receive the licence plate frame or the plate Why not
I was calling to get some info and the rep kept pushing me to make reservations His enghlish was horrible and he hang up on me right after he got the my phone number and email address Horrible experience
I purchased an Apple Time Capsule about 25 years ago It has sat on my desk for that time and hasnt moved It stopped responding about a month ago I took it into the Apple Store Covent Garden who were very nice but told me that there is nothing they can do about it They referred me to a Data Recovery company but say that there is nothing they can do to help If you are considering one of these products dont bother Save your 250 and buy an online backup service It will cost more in the long run but at least you will have youre data at the end of 25 years which is far more valuable
I was desperate for a cleaner  accepted the first person that replied he left 25 mins earlier  i felt pressured to give him a 5 star review would not use again
I purchased a doppler from this company and didnt hear anything for some time until I called them when I didnt get an answer Then they advised that my email address was wrong which after double checking was correct What a nightmare just to buy a product Will not recommend
I am not happy with the situation
I park my van here at night and Ive had issues
I have contacted parties that are involved regarding gate stuck open in all types of weather including nice days and the fact that the lighting does not work at night is the problem as the area is not the greatest
I have been waiting for the regional manager to contact me for weeks now to discuss and I am still waiting
Waist size is not accurateWay small
I had to have my shoes shipped a few different times cause they wouldnt get it right Then the shoes I ended up with run small apparently and got uncomfortable to wear after a while I took my socks off and found my skin in the sock
The locksmith was nice However I did not request one I looked at your website and put in the data for what I needed I then put in my home info It gave me the name of 3 locksmiths But I did not request one to be sent out since none showed weekend hours But some how one showed up I had already contacted someone else to come out The gentlemen from your website called and then showed up I assumed he was from the company I personally called So I was shocked to have the other company come out I even paid them the service fee since it was my fault for assuming the other gentlemen was from their shop Not good Homeadvisor
Have use this site before and had no problems use it again going to Rome to a hotel they should not use So unhappy about my holiday its suspose to be a time to relax and have peace this hotel provided none of that To be honest I dont think I will book through this site again
No explanation for extreme rate hike from 0017 to 0054 What gives Even your website advertises a 0039 rate Ive been with CallMuangThai for many years Am satisfied with quality but price is prohibitive Will look for other vendors
I received an email from them with regard to the upcoming renewal of my policy
It stated I was a valued customer and they looked forward to maintaining our business together  so much so I was to receive 10 discount on the 6094 price offered 
WOW I thought  thats nice of them  we are off on our hols in 3 weeks so I guess wed better renew as soon as we can 
However  My sensible wife said we should shop around and I reluctantly agreed as its me who has to get it sorted out
Guess what  same policy from Multitrip  on one of the comparison websites  3790
Obviously they have lost my business for trying to rip me off  My financial input to that company is miniscule so noone will lose sleep over it  but they HAVE lost a sale by being greedy
I would have happily renewed at last years price which is more than this years comparison site price
I dont understand insurance companies when they hike their prices for a renewal and pretend theyre doing you a favour with non existent loyalty discounts
Im now paying another company more than what I would be paying Multitrip for the same cover  obviously not sensible but quite satisfying on a personal level
No doubt I will be doing the same next year
I cannot comment on their phone service as they never answered the phone 
We spoke to redspot and were told it was okay to use the master card for the bond of someone other than the driver then when we got there because our driver did not have a master card we were forced to pay 700 for the week because of the young driver fees rather than the 380 of what we originally were promised
I ordered a gray wig but got a black one The choices on the website was not clear Please change that and make it very clear I hope I wont have a problem sending this wig back if so Ill never order from here again
Also you need to make more gray wigs like this and more kinky ones too We older ladies like the styles you make for the younger generation Now they are wearing the gray color too Make more
Thanks
PS I really like your wigs
Wanted to love this product  very excited that it is organic  chemicals free Unfortunately these tampons did not work for me Because of their design a roll of cotton like a roll of toilet paper they dont seem to expand properly and dont absorb well causing leakages and requiring more frequent change than previous brand used The plastic applicator appears very cheaply made and is flimsy  uncomfortable to use Not for me
bought 2 products find out in other online shop tge same product is way cheaper  wat to do I dont know maybe find a new online shop next time unfortunately 
I have bought 4 laptops from Laptopsdirect over the past 6 years Prices are keen and so long as you dont have an issue will score the company 1010 However on occasion you will need post sales support for this they wish you to use their emessage system I sent an emessage regarding the Asus laptop I bought in November Got a totally off the wall reply telling me to contact Lenovo We all make mistakes but since I pointed out that it was Asus I have had no replies and Ive asked them 3 times  no replies
Moral of this story you take risks with this company so long as there is no need for post sales support you will be fine But if you are risk averse then shop elsewhere There are too many similar reports of similar issues with LaptopsDirect
Customer Service is nonexistent
I was paying for the Quote d fare my card details were in when it came time to process fare jumped by over 300 this is unacceptable site did give the option to cancel or continue but than why advertise lower fare for customers if it is not available this is very wrong
When we went to pick up the sofa that we ordered the associate at the loading dock informed us that we did not have the appropriate paper work to pick up our item I explained to him that we were only given a sales receipt and he then told us we had to go to the store which was a good distance away and get the neccessary document He then rudely moved to the next person When we arrived in the store the associate that provided the pickup document stated that we did not have to walk all the way there to get it that he couldve just called them from the loading area Of course this upset me since we were just pushed aside so that the loading dock assiciate could just get to the next person as soon as possible When we arrived back around to the loading dock we had to wait an additional 3040 minutes for the other customers to get all of their things and leave We were in a bit of a time crunch to return our rental truck and this cost us alot of time I think this situation can be avoided if Home Zone provides a bit more customer service training
fraudulent and deceptive

The fabric is soft with soothing feeling But theyre too heavy and the curvy surface of tight wrap decrease the contact surface Also for me I really dont see the benefit of extra long in length
I booked a 2 month rental with Vacation Rental Pros in St Augustine FL at Sea Place My booking agent was very professional but then after moving in I encountered some issues with the condo A stove burner that didnt work and was just barely connected to a broken connector which posed a fire hazard and some missing blinds on windows in the bedroom that did not have any other window covering for privacy or blocking of the street lights I went to the Vacation Rental Pros office to report this and the reception person was not friendly at all as well as very apathetic to the problems I reported She said she would call maintenance but didnt even ask which unit I was in So I told her my unit so maybe she would actually call maintenance 2 WEEKS later someone called me in the middle of the day to tell me they were coming to fix the stove burner now I was not home so it was not a convenient time I told them to give me some more notice So a few days later they did not call but entered the condo without my knowledge I called to complain and the Vacation Rental Pro office said they were sorry but would come fix the washer I never said anything was wrong with the washer The window blind repairman called when he was outside the condo Again no notice and 2 weeks after reporting the problem My last issue was that the Vacation Rental Pros company called me to see if I wanted to book again for the following year I explained I was not vacationing but was temporarily displaced due to Hurricane Matthew They said ok Then I got another call about the same thing and again explained Then the very next day I got another call to book again Needless to day I would probably use other rental companies in the future
Extremely poor and unresponsive telephone customer service in finance team Spent several hours without being able to speak with anyone and the person spoken to arranged a callback not honoured wasting time and money
No response to email or online requests either 
Cancel a reservation more than 2 months out but if its not within 48 hours of making the reservation forfeit of 300
Will never use them again
They forget to issue billswould have thought this was automatic Has happened twice in a year and I ended up with 2 billsheating and electricity in the same month Very inefficient and financially difficult on me as a customer Would also like to see automatic log in to accounts ie password savethis had been a feature but seems to have been withdrawn
I booked with lastminute at 9pm last night for flights to NYC for 950 I received an email congratulating me and telling me to pack my bags I could have booked the same flights with expedia or the airlines direct for 1033 but was happy to save the cash as I trusted the lastminute brand This morning at 10am they emailed to say the booking was cancelled as the fare was no longer available Of course I then checked expedia and the airline immediately and these flights are now 1500 and 1800 pounds respectively At no point in the booking process did lastminute so much as hint that the flights may not be confirmed I am sure it is in the fine print but this should at least be nodded at when you are booking As I was booking late I knew prices would move fast so would not have taken the chance lastminutecom has lost me a small fortune and I will never ever even look at their their unreliable site again
The books arrived in good condition through many different mailings 10 days apart I was disappointed that 3 of the books were for veterans and stated on the book not to be sold I am a veteran myself and felt the instructions on these books should have been honored
I ordered a control panel for my dishwasher on November19 2016 It arrived quickly and I opened the package to confirm that it was the part that I ordered It was Technician came out and before installing new component performed some diagnostics on the dishwasher and determined that it needed another component We decided at that point to get a new dishwasher I contacted customer service and they sent me the necessary form and instructions for the return I packed it up in its original packing and box and promptly returned it tracked it and they received it some time in early December 2016 I received an email from customer service on Jan 9 2017 that the refund had been issued and it would take 46 weeks for me to receive the refund Today I thought too much time had passed and contacted customer service Extremely nice and accommodating Charles was there to help and informed me that the part had been installed and therefore rejected what ever that means I told Charles that no the part had never been installed and I was surprised that no communication had been initiated and that a company could just arbitrarily reject a returned part and I was out 130 for parts and shipping and another 10 to ship the part back Something very wrong here Incidentally I was aware of the their return policy regarding electrical components and is precisely why I asked the technician to perform additional diagnostics before installing the control panel so it wasnt like I was an uninformed consume This has been a BIG HASSLE RETURN Hopefully this will be resolved and I can get my money back
Tickets were way over priced for their location I would not use this service again and definitely not recommend Ticketmaster Resale  What a resale rip off
Im now in week 3 of a 24 day order and I still have not received my goods I called the customer service rep and was told it was due to poor shipping the rep took no accountability for my bad service First time ever Im truly disappointed in ordering from your site
Just made a booking with Goldcar I have used them before on several occasions and have been satisfied
However on this occasion I logged on and selected to redeem my reward points and received an acknowledgement stating they would be credited against my next booking which I duly made However at checkout there was no mention of the rewards points being applied and sure enough they are still showing in my account
There was also a promotion code that I copied and pasted only to receive a message stating that the code was invalid
Needs to be sorted out
Sadly I have told all my friends about this service and I wish I didnt Not only may they end up wasting there money they may have to deal with the rude and unhelpful Jeylec he is not he only one I regret having dealt with After being with this company for over a year and lots of money spent Im going to be taking my business elsewhere Australians choice has a good article about parcel forwarding services and the different companies well worth reading great comparison site I certainly wish I read it earlier
Very disappointed with this company having paid thousands for a bathroom which should have taken 8 days to fit it has been more than 3 weeks now First forgot to order our sink secondly another fitter has taken out materials from the warehouse which mean our job has been delayed and they have had to order materials again General manager does not care having spoken to her numerous times The manager of the store promised to keep me updated and when the materials would arrive she failed to do this and I have had to phone her today and still have no answer
This is very unsatisfactory service and will not be using them again
Placed an order on Jan 27 Received confirmation Checked on order on Feb 2 Got a response saying package was addressed wrong and it was being returnedit obviously was a computer mistake as whole parts of the address was omitted Doesnt a human check addresses  this obviously not going to be delivered without a state city or even my correct name Finally on Feb 6 I received word that the package was being shipped by FedEx I still have not received it  Customer Service obviously needs tweeking They dropped the ball numerous times on this order
we purchased a ticket last january its a ticket for EXOrDIUMinMANILA i message them last monts and they said its all under controlBut when i ask them again yesterday they said it doesnt existwhy is that i was asking their costumer service a while ago but still no response

Ordered shoes with standard delivery Now 2 weeks since order and order information has had to be chased by me to get any delivery status Now informed at least another week or so before delivery Will not use again
In response to your trustpilot reply can I just reconfirm the order in question is not the jacket you referred to but an order I placed on 19th Jan 2017 For Barker shoes
was not told informed of E50 charge for changeover
was non informed of a maximum usage above which  a higher unit price applies
I received a promotional email stating I had a 35 credit in my account and I understand shipping is free on my first order Neither one of these happened when I placed my order I did not receive the 35 credit at all when I checked out and I was charged for shipping I am very disappointed
I found Trivago easy to use but on check out I reviewed all the info it was correct but when I printed out the reservation they had moved me to the hotel next door The hotel next door was not comparable to the BB I had tried to book and it did not ask me before doing so I had to cancel the reservation and it cost me 30 to do so The hotel it sent me to doesnt even have a working phone number
A family member ordered me a micro SD cards for a gift exchange and I received SD cards I contacted beach camera about what to do their reply was send the SD cards back to us and reorder the Micro SD cards so I did The second order that was sent to me was not even close to what I had ordered and after contacting beach camera again their reply was just send the order back and reorder NO I am sorry how can we make things right with you I explained to beach camera my family were leaving for vacation and need of the memory cards for some new recording devices we were taking with us and had already wasted two weeks of time trying to get the micro SD cards Well Beach camera left me feeling like they did not care and that it was my problem
QUESTION What happened to customer service 
I had to become a member to redeem the gift card I received That feels like robbery to me It would be one thing if the membership was free but its 4995 a month unless I remember to skip a month or call to cancel my membership This feels like a scam
In your page you said same day delivery but dont say that the sundays you dont have delivery service This is important because I pay a delivery fee and that was the worst delivery service that I ever had Talk with somebody of Euroflorist or somebody of your partner was impossible and the recipient had to coordinate all the delivery and thats not service
My package was not delivered and I tried contacting the customer service but did not receive a response Im still trying to contact Opticontacts for me order as my credit card has been charged Please look into it
I had a problem checking out so I called support Support was not willing to help me with my issue and my call was hung up on
I order one 8cm 5m and got 3 of them and order 2 o the 10 cm x 5 m and got none I email them a week ago and have not hear from them yet on what to do

To expensive when not on the VIP list 
This product does not heat up hot enough only 220 F as opposed to other products which heats up to 400 F End results fall way short of what was expectedIf I could I would return for a refund
Ordered pizza got a Confirmation text for delivery at 710 The delivery came at 740 with a really cold pizaa never going to order from them again Called up the restaurant they said they recieved the order late from marvin
After over two weeks and multiple emails runners went missing in transit and no apology or explanation
They never have my contacts in stock and the backorder process takes too long I will be sourcing my contacts elsewhere moving forward
Bad experience In reply to your email I never sent it That is true because when I went to print out your packing slip and postage it was not there When I emailed you about that issue you told me to mail it at my expense and you would reimburse me If I was told one thing by you in the first place and you didnt come through why would I believe you the next
I already sent in one review apparently you dont read them On that one I gave 4 out of 5 stars because of delay in receiving my certification card and STILL do not have it If no response Ill do another review with 0 stars  very disappointed
In early January we purchased a flight through lastminutecom believing it to be a reliable agency from which to buy a SE Asian flight Alas we couldnt have been more wrong The VietJet flight was to be taken in March from Ho Chi Minh City to Bangkok This was confirmed by lastminutecom on 8 January But just a week later we received another email from lastminutecom telling us that the airline had made a change to our booking and we were now booked onto a completely different flight which left Ho Chi Minh City over 4 hours later than the one originally bought As we have onward travel connections in Bangkok this flight is completely useless to us After countless telephone calls and emails finally lastminutecom agreed that our booking needed to be cancelled and a refund made to us That was on 26 January We have made further phone calls and emails  yet here we are a month later and still the refund has not been received Then to add insult to injury at 5am this morning the entire household was awoken by a phone call from either lastminutecom or VietJet not sure which my husband was half asleep trying to persuade us to take the flight which is no good to us I just dont understand the problem here We paid lastminutecom for a flight that has since been pulled by the airline Our contract with lastminutecom was broken SO WHERE IS OUR REFUND By the way we have already booked another suitable flight with another airline we can no longer wait for lastminutecom to sort the issue out And needless to say we will never ever use lastminutecom again  and from reading all the other complaints here on Trustpilot will certainly advise others to avoid lastminutecom like the plague
Ordered 7 days ago Still no shipping notification
I went to pick up my package the day after the delivery company said they had delivered it The person told me to wait while they had a look in the back for my package They said it didnt arrive yet and took down my number to contact me for when they do get my package I went in the next day regardless of a call The person said they actually did have the item the whole time but it was double stickered so they didnt realise it was mine They had my package and still did not contact me when they found out If i was not stubborn i might have never got my fresh new creps

WARNING DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE
THIS IS A HUGE SCAM
We canceled our order the day we made them It turns out you can get your password without rushing it in 7 days We went through the US Postal Service It cost us 174
What REALLY stinks is the Rushmypassportcom site has yet to refund us They processed the charge in less than an hour However its now one month later and still no refund Weve contacted the State Department Will be contacting the Better Business Bureau as well And well be going on to every site we can find to give them poor ratings
I bought some sleepytime tea and chocolate cocoa knowing they were expired I bought them thinking they were just expired wrongthey were 2 years out of date and unfortunately they tasted old The tea I could just drink the cocoa I tossed in the trashed Wont be purchasing from them again 
After being told it was free delivery I then had to pay a 16 import charge after my glasses taking over 2 weeks to arrive I am pleased with the glasses however would be hesitant to shop with coolframes again in the future
Its ALL scam They hire so called Authors who through the platform of Themeforest are able to push any st they want Over a week ago I bought a template from Serzh Before I made the purchase he assured me that his template was fully compatible with mobile devices After the installation it turned out that hires images do not adjust automatically to mobile devices So called customer service practically doesnt exist Stay away from them as far as possible
I ordered flowers for Valentines Day  they arrive Feb 16 Ridiculous Also I specifically selected an arrangement that included a vase since my recipient was in a hotel and wouldnt have her own vase  but the flowers were delivered with no vase
Overall I was very disappointed and felt mislead I will never use Euroflorist again
I dont think so if this is legit
I referred someone and the person did not receive the discount nor did they send the money they claimed to give for referring someone

Qantas is our Australian airline but they dont seem to want to provide customer service anymore We are travelling overseas in April and want to use our Qantas Frequent Flyer cards as a cash card Thats pretty simple to do online however one our cards is not suitable for cash card and needs updating We rang the Frequent Flyer Service Centre and gave up after waiting for 25 minutes for a real person to answer the phone So we emailed Qantas customer service That was over a week ago and there has been no reply We looked up the Qantas website and found that they have an office at 144 North Terrace Adelaide so we drove to Adelaide from the hills found a park 18 cost and walked for 20 minutes to the address Office closed and apparently has been closed for about 13 years We think you need to lift your game Qantas Think well just go to a bank and get our cash cards  its easier Tim and Cathy Nairne South Australia
Bad service and damaged good
I phoned here about 3 days before booking to ensure that I could pay using two credit cards and was told it was perfectly fine When I phoned to book my flight they took all the usual details and then I was told they would just get authorisation to use two cards for payment I was on hold for about 15 mins was already on the phone for about 30 mins at that point and then was told that unfortunately the request was declined with no explanation why Thinking it was a fluke I called after an hour to try again This time even longer hold of about an hour Same result I phoned a different agency who promptly processed my request and with a ticket that was 50 cheaper Will never book here after my experience Complete waste of time
I am very dissatisfied with what has occured with booking my trip from Saskatoon To Kelowna March 1st  I indicated I did not want insurance but needed to book the trip  however did not know how to get rid of that charge  Tried several times to click it off but could not  I then thought if I confirmed the flight maybe this would be deducted but that did not happen either  I want this 352 gone off my account  I did not ask for it and refuse to pay it

This company is a fake they have sold me something which is a lie They didnt have a clue what they were selling an now Ive discovered and Ive been trying to get in contact its been brushed off as they gesture information its not their problem if its wrong they just have to sell me what I want That was the response I received They need to be shut down Im now 400 out of pocket due to this scam
Pricing varies depending on whether you order direct from their web site or search for an Internet special link an increasingly common practice The better the price the higher the handling profit charge which in my experience ranged from 11 to 28 Unfriendly and unhelpful customer service not too bright either All said found some alternate sources to what used to be a friendly upstanding competitivelypriced company A shame
They hide that its send from China therefore you will have to pay the double of the original price Just Its really not worth trading with these dropshippers
First your business model is faulty This is an understatement In bold red letters you state the Intro Price is 1297 for a sports bra Then in checkout that Intro Price changes to 2997 This is deceptive consumer practices You cannot coax a customer into purchasing then change the price If the customer does not double check she would never know the price did not actually reflect the Intro Price
Secondly the styles could be better These dramatic prints cheapen the leggings No one wants to look like they went to a tween mall store to purchase leggings Furthermore the popular styles are either out of stock or low quantity The popular sizes are either out of stock or low quantity
Third some of these styles are impractical There needs to be a differentiation between styles intended to be worn in the gym and styles intended for athleisure
Fourth no one wants to be forced to be a VIP You basically cannot make a purchase unless you are VIP member
These are all the problems I noticed and it is my first purchase Therefore I am reluctant as to how long I will be a forced VIP member
I purchased the Transitions lenses for an additional 60 When I received the glasses I noticed that there was always a bit of a tint to the lenses I was not aware this would be the case with Transitions lenses so I sent the glasses back Not only did I have to forfeit the 60 extra I paid for adding on the Transitions lenses but was told that in order to get lenses without Transitions addon that I would need to pay additional 5975 to get lenses without the Transitions I am out 120 for something that I did not want after having the opportunity to exam them when I received the physical product
Donot buy any product on DinoDirect they SCAM Dinodirect scam They sent me the wrong product item which cheaper a lot

I was missing one item from my original order and when I called was told it would be sent that was 8 days ago and I still do not see it has been shipped yet
One item that I did receive was so defective I had to return very disappointed
I bought a recliner for 100 plus It was coming apart within two weeks and the material is cheap I thought I was getting a deal but the recliner is cheap and is not working well and I have only had it alittle over a month now They say they will replace it or give you a better deal but its not worth the time You still get the same product
Ad said 18 per minute when Im checking out it say 25 per minute Definitely a bait  switch
Call quality ok Not good for Caribbean calls
I will not send money using remitly anymore  They promise and their promotion is to have a 30 gift card for the 1st timer to send money so I did try sending money in the philippines I emailed them asking wheres my 30 gift card  They said oh because our promotion is to like this like that 
Very bad experience and sorry to say but thats true 
I ordered frames on 122317 was contacted almost a week later to say that they were temporarily out of stock but stock had been confirmed with the manufacturer and that I should have the frames within 14 weeks It is now over 5 weeks later 6 after placing order and still no frames Contact customer service and told that they would need to confirm status with the buyers and they would update me by email within 24 hours
They have my money I do not have my frames after 6 weeks I will be interested to see what else they have to say But right now I would not recommend this company Very poor customer service experience so far
BUYER BE WARE
Was advised it was shipped and would arrive three days ago Now USPS say it  will be delayed  No further information
Company charged my corporate card 6 xs for a total 898 Unable to verify hotel reservations and no one could help me woth a credit to my account I gave yhem verification codes authorization s etc They put me on hold and transferred me to multiple people I gave up and contacted my home office to put a stop on the card So now no one gets paid and Im reporting them and so is my company and bank
The content is good but the amount of review time and the timers is completely ridiculous After completing a module you must wait anywhere from 15 to 2 hours just to start the next one making it impossible to just sit down and complete drivers ed over the course of a weekend On top of that the timers inside the modules are a hassle It makes you wait 30 seconds to read a paragraph

I am frankly beyond horrified by all aspects of your customer care and would not recommend booking with Opodo to anyone I cancelled a flight almost four months ago and am STILL waiting for a refund 4VF4UK Eight calls eleven emails and countless hours spend in their line have not fixed the situation Seeing as I am waiting for 1350 EUR to be refunded this has left in a real financial pickle It seems to be well known that refunds are currently taking a while but there is simply no excuse for a company this size to deliver such poor customer care I am selfemployed and had to pay my lawyer and also book another flight  had I not had a little buffer to fall back on this could have easily meant the end of my small business Its not just that I am still waiting for my money I have also experienced several cases of miscommunication My last email from more than a week ago is still unanswered and in my call just now no one could tell me when I can expect the refund I will continue to voice my concern about this company as I know many people would struggle with such delays after spending some hard earned cash on a holiday
Da ich es wichtig finde dass sich potentielle Kunden auch in Deutsch informieren knnen poste ich hier eine meiner Nachrichten an Opodo die den Fall genauer beschreibt Bedacht werden sollte mein Lesen dass es sich bei Weitem nicht um meine erste Anfrage handelt der Ton fllt entsprechend ungeduldig aus Ich htte erwartet ich nach so einer Nachricht eine UMGEHENDE Bearbeitung und etwas mehr als eine einfache Entschuldigung beispielsweise in Form eines Gutscheines
Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren
ich musste beim lesen dieser Nachricht fast schmunzeln wre es nicht so unfassbar gewesen
Ich werde versuchen den Fall so genau wie mglich zu schildern  da ich der Aufnahme meiner diversen Anrufe nie widersprochen habe knnen Sie die genauen Daten und die von Ihnen gemachten Aussagen allerdings sicherlich auch auf diese Weise nachvollziehen
Diesen Flug habe ich am 6 Oktober also vor mehr als elf Wochen storniert Zu diesem Zeitpunkt wurde die Flugzeit bereits zweimal gendert und ich hatte drei unterschiedliche Flugbesttigungen erhalten Es hat damals ein lngeres Telefonat gegeben indem ich erklrt hatte dass ich mehrere Meetings in LA aufgrund der Verschiebungen nicht wahrnehmen konnte Der Kollege prfte die Sachlage und sicherte mir zu dass der volle Flugpreis aufgrund der Verschiebung erstattet werden knne Wichtig zu wissen ist dabei dass mehrere unterschiedliche Aussagen zur tatschlichen Flugzeit gemacht wurden bitte hren Sie sich dazu das Band an und dass ich den Flug nie storniert htte wenn ich nicht darauf verlassen htte dass der Betrag erstattet werden knnte Ich habe dann ber einen anderen Anbieter einen anderen Flug gebucht und meine Termine verschoben
Unabhngig davon dass Ihre letzte Aussage allein weder verbraucherschutzrechtlich vertretbar noch hflich oder in Einklang mit gutem Kundenservice ist bin ich entsetzt darber wie der Fall in den letzten Wochen gehandhabt wurde
Nachdem ich nach sechs Wochen nichts von der Erstattung gehrt hatte hatte ich drei Anfragen zum derzeitigen Stand ber Ihre Website eingereicht Jedes Mal erhielt ich eine Standardantwort mit dem Hinweis auf eine schnellstmgliche Bearbeitung Keiner der Kollegen hat sich dabei die Mhe gemacht zu prfen ob es vielleicht ein Problem in der Bearbeitung gibt welches zu der Verzgerung gefhrt hat  ansonsten wre das Problem ja schon viel eher aufgefallen
Nach etwa 78 Wochen fing ich an mich wchentlich telefonisch bei Ihnen nach dem Stand zu erkundigen Erneut wurde mir gesagt dass der Fall bereits in der Buchhaltung sei und man sich schnellstmglich darum kmmern wrde Nie wurde erwhnt dass die Freigabe einer vollen Erstattung durch BA berhaupt zur Debatte steht
Ich vermute es war der 12 Dezember an dem mir Zugesichert wurde dass die Erstattung nun endlich freigegeben wrde Ich sollte noch am gleichen Tag Rckmeldung erhalten da ich nun schon so lange Geduld gezeigt hatte Wieder habe ich daraufhin nichts gehrt Am 13 Dezember erhielt ich eine merkwrdige Stornierungsbesttigung per Email ohne eine Aussage zur Summer zum Bearbeitungsstand oder zur Auszahlungssumme
Daraufhin wandte mein Anwalt Dr Bernd Koch sich schriftlich an Sie mit der Bitte um eine Stellungnahme Ihre Antwort steht auch hier noch aus
Heute sprach ich mit einem sehr netten Kollegen von dem ich zum ersten Mal eine wirkliche Entschuldigung hrte Er versicherte mir sich direkt mit seinem Vorgesetzten um den Fall zu kmmern und erklrte dass der Kollege der mir ursprnglich die volle Erstattung zugesagt hatte sich mit BA in Verbindung setzen wrde um den Fall zu klren und dass dieser sich dann heute bei mir melden wrde Er sagte mir auch zu dass Opodo die Kosten bernehmen wrde falls BA die Anfrage abwiese da ja eine verbindliche Aussage von Ihnen gemacht wurde
Nun erhalte ich eine Standardemail mit der Aussage dass die volle Erstattung gar nicht erfolgen kann und bin gelinde gesagt sprachlos
Ich bin mit meiner Geduld am Ende und bitte Sie daher um Folgendes Bitte setzen Sie sich mit den gemachten Aussagen meinen mehrfachen Kontaktaufnahmen und der rechtlichen Lage auseinander Sprechen Sie mit Ihren Teammitgliedern um solche Situation zu vermeiden und erstatten Sie mir den vollen Betrag bis zum 31122016
Vielen Dank

I purchased a lens from ebay and selected UPS Next Day delivery for 990 The next day the tracking showed the item was at my local depot and stated Out for delivery at 733am I signed up for email notifications and also waited at home all day constantly checking the tracking info There was no delivery or call or email and then at around 830pm the tracking info updated to say rescheduled for the next day
Frustrated I complained to UPS customer help and the answer I got was that the item was not loaded on the van because it arrived after the van left as if they have one van They then suggested I should pick up the item from the depot myself at 800am the next morning I told them thats not possible and besides I have paid 990 for delivery I requested they should deliver my package by 12pm the next day and they refused to prioritise my delivery although they had already been late
The next day the item was out for delivery at 600am this time so I was more hopeful it would arrive However UPS failed to deliver again I contacted customer support on twitter again after 10pm since the depot telephone lines close at 8pm I got the response that the delivery can come at 7pm or later and the current time is 3pm I reminded them that it is actually 1030pm where I am and that the item has not arrived They then told me there will be another delivery attempt the next third day This was originally for a NEXT DAY delivery
I am frankly astounded at the lack of service I have received for 990 for a 2kg parcel and the fact that UPS customer service have not compromised or made any effort to minimise my loss by sending my delivery out on a priority after it was late
You literally had one job UPS and you failed to deliver You not only have caused me distress but wasted time dealing with this I hope I will never have to use your service ever again and I wouldnt wish it on anyone
Make sure you have either a landline or cellular bavk up in case WiFi goes down 40 minute delay in receiving call from monitoring centre when WiFi went down Monitoring centre was no help at all Simply said to call Think
I love NFM but its time to update the website Its clunky slow and hard to find anything
If I could give 0 stars I would I called asking for some rims options for my project truck a 96 Chevy K3500 and the customer sales rep guided to some fuel rims that would fit my truck so I ordered them based on his guarantee they would fit my truck It has taken me a while to get my project truck back together and I tried to install them today and they dont fit not even close They have a 1 offset and I need at least and 20 offset I just got off the phone with Justin and he said because of the lapsed time no matter if his guy sold me the wrong product that he wasnt going to fix their mistake and there was nothing he was going to do about it RIDICULOUS I will never buy any more parts for my trucks from here ever again Do yourself a favor and order from someone who cares
Arrived at the car rental 1 our before scheduled time because off the time difference Ive forgot that when I signed the lease at home The manager at goldcar at told me that the car was not in but he got a larger car With a higher price We waited an hour an got our car cold and totally scratched and dirty At goldcars area there where at least 10 cars same model All of them cold not been out for a spin
Great customer service Goldcar
Next time I will pay overprice to avoid Goldcar
The item I ordered was used I did not realize it The man I talked to was very curt and told me there were no refunds or exchanges on used items
I was very disappointed when I booked my flights to Iceland through lastminutecom After selecting the flights and entering all my details lastminute said that my flights would be confirmed within 24 hours Two hours later I received a call from lastminute informing me that the tickets for my outbound flight were now unavailable They offered a full refund I was quite annoyed that lastminute had taken the money from my account before checking that the flight was available I was even more annoyed that I was able to purchase the same outbound flight through easyjet but for significantly more money It would seem that the price for this flight had gone up and lastminute didnt want to make a loss Clearly they dont mind taking my money first
Never received item  and was ignored when tried to contact SkypeEmailPaypal  Online chat 
thanks that i used paypal and they got me money  but wasted more then a month to get money
Ordered frames on Friday Simple ecommerce transaction Now Monday order is still pending and no one is available on Live Chat have been waiting for someone on phone for 20 minutes Im pretty sure they dont actually have the frames their website allowed me to order because the frames arent available anywhere else In the meantime my daughter is waiting for replacement amblyopia correction glasses and my order is hung in the morass of some poorly run company Take your business elsewhere
I am very glad to have received this email asking me to review the company I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED I took the adult and pediatric CPR AED and Basic first aid course
I do want to note that the instructor of the class did a very good job teaching was very thorough and was open for questions That is not why I am disappointed
I have waited 3 years to get into nursing school and needed this certification as a last check to get in My deadline was quickly approaching and I had still not received my certification I had sent multiple emails to the corporate office requesting a certification and no answer TWO MONTHS LATER I received an email certification which was thank goodness excepted by my school
On another note I paid to receive a basic first aid kit after the completion of the course When I approached the instructor about it she had no idea what I was talking about
SO GETTING TO THE POINT I TOOK THIS COURSE ON 11162016 AND AM STILL WAITING TO RECEIVE MY CERTIFICATION CARDS AND FIRST AID KIT IN THE MAIL
Dont ever sign up through this company they took my money and have not followed through on what I paid for
Purchased a paperback that was listed as very good condition It was at best bad condition I had to use packing tape to front and back covers due to the deterioration Ordinarily I dont complain about online purchases but this was so far off the truth that I had to write
We purchased the couch which is great early January We were told the shipment would come in in a week maybe two at the latest Took over a month I called every week and every week I was told the order should be in soon I shouldve got a refund but we were in desperate need of a couch The couch is great quality but we sure paid the price for it and then some
Keeping me informed during the shipment and delivery was great The set up was straight forward The major problem has been both A4 mattresses are collapsing after less than 4 week use Both sides of the split bed are collapsing in an area about 18 inch diameter where the butt weight is concentrated One on the mattresses is also settling side to side so one side is nearly 12 inch lower than the other I have photos if it would help review I am deciding if it is worth the cost to send back or replace mattresses locally
I took my car to a shop to install the kit but it didnt work it only lights up and doesnt rev
When I contacted them they told me we are not responsible  I lost 200 dollars for nothing
I was looking for a rental car to use in Israel It was difficult to learn what the insurance coverage would be for the car Also I was hoping to obtain a complete Quote for the use of the car before having to reserve it In addition I learned that if I picked the car up at the Tel Aviv airport there would have been a additional 28 fee
Because of the confusion I choice to use a Israeli rental company named
Eldan Car Rental
Same prices as everyone else
Incompatibility with Windows 10 contributed to crashing my harddrive Panda Technical Support acknowledged this and suggested reloading Windows as a possible fix Reloading the OS to make their lousy software work
Ive written repeatedly to Customer Service sic and they wont reply they just keep sending the same tech reply through Tech support
And this was my 2nd year as a paid user
AVOID at all costs
Package arrived cleverly slit on the back with one pill pushed out of its bubble I didnt realize this until after Id signed for and accepted the envelope Im out 7500 and apparently the mailman gets free meds
SAVE YOURSELF the HEADACHE and your MONEY and AVOID this company at all costs The cheap fares are BS you will never save money flying with thieves
I spoke to Bravofly and Easyjet before booking two tickets one for an unaccompanied minor They confirmed to me the minor could fly with his older brother so I bought the two tickets One of the tickets went through and the other was pending until I called several hours later to find out why it was pending They told me they had cancelled one of the tickets saying they dont allow unaccompanied minors They then refused to cancel the first ticket for my older child although I was in the 24 hour federal time slot allowing me to cancel my ticket with no penalty this is a US Federal Law covering all tickets purchased by people located in the USA I had no need for the first ticket since I needed my boys to travel TOGETHER
I called five different times to try to speak to a supervisor or ANYONE who wasnt extremely rude and unhelpful No luck They were so disgusting they actually hung up the phone on me or yelled at me
I am disputing the charges with my credit card company This company is a scam dont waste your time or money
To Bravofly Your COMPANYs days are ALMOST UP Your dishonesty and thievery and disregard for customers is catching up with you I look forward to seeing you out of business 
i ordered flowers card XXL teddy bear macaroons
they only delivered the flowers and the card
i sent them an email asking for a refund for the missing items but they didnt refund or reply to me
I ordered my invitations here and I just want to warn anyone that is interested in this company to move onto another Website is annoying to use when making your invite it shut off and had me redu the order like 3 times Then when i went to checkout i saw they put 3 orders of my invitations and im glad i really looked at it because i had to remove it They dont give you an actual font size Its all a guess They say if your unhappy you can get money back but not with personalization Just a warning EVERYTHING is personalized so dont fall for that scam You have to pay 50 of the order if you want to fix anything And if its something that you feel is on their end its a joke to get any help The Customer Service is HORRIBLE I cant express that enough If you are someone like me that needs good customer service to help make something a little better to move forward without stress then this is not the place Its worth the extra money to have no stress and i regret going with this company If theres anything you need help with it wont happen I spoke with someone that was apparently the supervisor and she treated me horrible on the phone They dont care about you as a client and possible referrals to others just your money She lied to me and told me that she didnt have a manager theres nothing she could do for me she had no empathy in her to voice that i was upset or stressed out Got a call from the manager so that proved the supervisor lied to me and was suppose to receive a call back from the manager after that and never did Theres more to the story but without making it super long I made a decision to not give them anymore of my money and will tell everyone to avoid the stress This is the only issue i have had with my wedding plans I only give them 1 star because i liked the overall look of the invites but they were not exactly how i expected and wanted and the customer service is a complete joke
The flower bouquet we got didnt match the one that was displayed on euroflorist webpage The color of the flowers was different and the whole arrangement was badly executed The flowers used to create the bouquet were old and withering and their color was pinkish instead for white They have also used very small flowers that werent open yet So the winter bouquet was pinkish with a majority of green leaves I dont see the similarity between the bouquet advertised on the webpage and the one I received
Driver called but didnt get through to us However there is no way for us to leave a message to give him directions or even to get back in contact So frustrating
I find it really disappointing that theres no QC department who checks things before they are sent out I ordered 85 wooden USB drives for my company to give out at a charity gala I went through each and every one and found about 25 visible ones that were good quality The rest of them were inconsistent and hardly legible I was told by the company that laser engraving is inconsistent and they would not all look the same That being understood I find it odd that they wouldnt have a QC department who checked them before they were mailed out I even asked if I could do laser and they said it would still not be consistent or reliable Which then brings me to the point of asking why this is even being sold or why it was not brought up as a concern before me ordering They did offer to send it back for a refund less postage but I had no time to get a new product before the event I would be so ashamed to send something out that was not made right Have some respect
I purchased a Tissot watch with a fabric band The band started unraveling after two months Customer service said this is not covered by the warranty and would not help with a repair or even instruct me on how to replace it The prices are great but only if you never have a problem with the product I recommend sellers who provide better customer support
I ordered my bed 112016 It sat in transit for two weeks at a location for no reason of why it wasnt being delivered I called to ask what the problem is and they claim that I had to call to setup a delivery Isnt that their job So I call to schedule a date Still no bed and were now 012017
Twice now the shipping company has no called and no showed for delivery and failed to call to reschedule for two weeks So now I have been waiting an extra month for my bed because no one wants to do their job I am extremely disappointed Im glad shipping is free because they dont deserve a dime
I booked a flight through this bunch using a debit card for which they state no charge They applied a credit card charge anyway and then refused to refund it give some lame and convoluted excuse
Avoid this company there are far more trustworthy services available

I ordered flowers for my wife and they never were delivered They charge a lot of money more than the regular price On the website doesnt exist phone number or other contact for make a formal complain This is a FRAUD DONT USE IT
Slow email feedback and the postal service was not good
I placed an order for two pair of kids glasses in Decemberl received one pair and the other is on back order for who knows how long
Economy car rental rates are very misleading because they would not accept my car insurance They insisted that they did not accept Canadian insurance I could not fine that documentation in their policy anywhere The rate Quote d on line was 328 Canadian and I ended up paying more than 700 American in order to get a car They would not accept my insurance in fact they didnt even look at my documentation I would have gone to another company but it would have meant going back to the airport I will never rent from them again
Dont buy from Harvey Norman and get it delivered for free because they havent a clue I bought a super king size bed and mattress from them online and said that because it was over a certain price I got free delivery and would take 57 working days it is now the 11th working day and still no bed or mattress Me and my wife have been sleeping on a mattress on the floor for the last 2 weeks waiting on this bed When I rang up I was told that it would not arrive until after the 15th of February Thats just unacceptable if you advertise something and specific that it will arrive within a certain number of days then it should arrive within those time frames This has changed my perspective on Harvey Norman for good
Dropped my phone off to get the screen fixed 6 hours later my phone was ready for pick up with a missed call and voicemail from FoxPaw Except they had my phone during that period so it was a bit odd There was no mention of leaving an alternate number on the screen or else I would have done so It simply said phone number Everything looked fine at first glance but on closer look one side of the screen was elevated An hour or 2 later I made a call and my screen was flickering and then went black Quite odd After a few moments I tried to test it again make a facetime call and it went black again Later on I attempted using apps but each time I would open an app the screen would go black again Weird right
So I email FoxPaw asking for a refund because obviously waiting 6 hours paying 100 and getting a phone worse off is not what I paid for I was later informed that refunds werent available because there was a 1 year warranty and I would need to bring the phone back in Who has 6 hours to give again to be without their main source of communication The only time a refund was possible was if Foxpaw deemed the phone beyond repair
The moral of this story is I will just go to the apple store and pay the extra 50 to part with my phone for an hour as opposed to 6 and also have a functioning phone upon return Or I just wont drop my phone 
On the positives the product is excellent and of high quality They dealt with our developer in the way youd expect spending thousands on kitting out 4 bathrooms in our new home
We made a simple request to order towel holders and some shower Accessories after moving in Told we would have to wait 5 weeks It took closer to 12 We didnt like 2 of the items notified them immediately and returned them and to this day still have not received a refund The excuses have been contradictory and frankly embarassing Professionally it goes without saying I could not recommend using them They are not geared up as a B2C organisation Avoid
Dont be fooled by Dhgate positive reviews like I did Ordered dress from the seller ElegantdressesOrder no 332550208 and everything about the dress was wrongmaterial size and craftsmanship The dress was Inside Out Opened a dispute seller said they will make a new dress if I close it Dhgate will never give you full refund unless you send the item back even though it was useless It was gonna cost over 50 to ship it back which was ridiculous I emailed dispute to close it believing that seller will keep to their word and also the person who handled the dispute said If you have any problem later or seller do not cooperate and help you solve the problem please do not hesitate to tell us We will help you further Please do not worry They never made it and kept dragging on with lie after lie
I kept emailing the person who handled the dispute  no reply Emailed customer service  no reply Then I contacted the live support multiple times and spent hours First person said ask seller leave a message saying I agree to give you a refund of  How can this happen when the seller does not respond to you Then every time after all the representatives kept saying hat they escalated the case and dhgate will email but that never happened I chased this for over 6 months
This seller was exploiting the system and committing serious misconduct and they literally took no action  showed a blind eye to this DHGATE CUSTOMER SERVICE  SELLERS ARE ALL LIARS AND ULTRA GREEDY SCAM ARTISTS No matter what even if they send completely useless item they will make money because the return costs are so high What a complete waste of time money and energy Learnt a valuable lesson not to trust anyone so easily
Dont be a victim AVOID THIS HORRIBLE SITE LIKE A PLAGUE
Very reliable and excellent quality with life style sports
Dont have good company service
Id love to give a review but Ive not received my socks Im told that they shipped Still waiting
the staff do not want to work in liffey valley in dublin when i ask for my size they wont look for this shoe please have a word with shop manger thank you MAIREAD HARKIN
There were links up to 2000m on the website I chose the lowest value of 100m and they said sorry we are out of stock 3 hour wait minimum
GTFO and give my money back
God knows how long ill be waiting for a refund submitted a ticket with paypal
Clearly there are some fake reviews on here regarding Banggood All review sites have some much amount negativity about a company and not all positive as many only come on them to complain Read between the lines on here
IF YOU DECIDE TO USE THEM PAY WITH PAYPAL ONLY So when and it will do go wrong there is a back up
Banggood deliveries where in my opinion not too bad but the after support is totally disgusting and unbelievable the tricks they will try to avoid getting you a refund backOnly Paypal will support you if things go wrong
I received a phone which had a fault on it a few weeks before Christmas and I was informed to send the phone back to wait for it CHINA So I had to cough up the delivery costs to send back to China and even with a tracking number they made sure that no one collected it at there end until you send them emails to do it and paypal wanted them to do it come 15th February over 2 months later paypal forced a refund back as they could see it was returned
If you want shoddy after sales support from CHINA then Banggood is for you otherwise just stick locally in your own country instead
Payed for their unlock services solution in 15 working days on Nov11
After many complaint emails they told us it was finally done unlocked on Dec 20th It never worked and the phone is still locked Asked for the refund and had no repply
Ive no idea how so many 1 stars can contribute to a 93 rating Ill tell each of you with a 5 Star be thankful your order wasnt wrong Your 5 star would not exist Emailing a shipping label to return a wrong size tshirt Nope they told me they did twice to check your spam box and if its not in your spam box it must be my fault Worse yet Ive asked for the location to ship the stuff myself and cant get a response Serious Wont buy from again Even if my confidence in an exact order was 100 Would if I could Eric Ask Becca
I used rebtel app for one number and then I changed my number for which I have international calling so I uninstalled the app but after 2 months 10 has been deducted How can I get the refund How to remove autopayment I dont get any information regarding customer servicecan someone help me
As a long time customer I am disappointed and still waiting for a response to my last email
If I had wanted or been able to get out and go to the store I would not have ordered from this site Now I have to find someone to pick up at post office since that is where delivery was made Instead of being easier it is now more difficult Totally disappointed Will be sure to bad mouth the company to any one I know that uses these products and needs the ease of home delivery It is not home delivery if you still have to go get it
I ordered flowers the week before Valentines Day FloraQueen never delivered or attempted to deliver these flowers I filed multiple complaints but their customer service ignored me Additionally they placed multiple fraudulent charges on my credit card I now have to change my credit card information to prevent them from taking more money I strongly recommend avoiding this business Do not give them your credit card information
Like other providers you never give bonus credits
I have never ordered from a company and have it take almost 1 month to find out that it is now in transit I still have yet to receive itso I am just assuming it will come But this is a very slow company so if you dont mind waiting then it will be fine
We needed to change our 3 2day tickets for White Pass because of rain on 02152017 Liftopia charged us 20 per ticket for the change It rained on 0216 so there was limited operation of chairs at White Pass so they gave the people a discount for full day tickets if you bought at the resort Liftopia would give us no partial rebate
Korrekt leverans i tid
Love all of your products but your extremely low inventory levels are near infuriating
This was ordered a month ago and we have still heard nothing Nobody was rude and there has been no friction There hasnt been anything If it is not going to be coming anytime soon an update would at least be nice
My experience with the employee went well but the product has completely failed in my eyes I spent alot of money on the water softener and water purifier equipment before installing the new system we ran all new PEX pipes throughout our house So all the water lines are brand new we also drained our water heater So far the hard water build up that we are having is worse then before we had the system i even have Moen spot resistant fixtures and everyday the water spots keep getting worse I wish I could return this system and just get a salt water softener since they seem to get rid of water spots
LE SERVICE EN LUI MEME EST BON MAIS LES FLEURS LIVREES NI LE BOUQUET NE CORRESPONDAIENT PAS DU TOUT A LA COMMANDE
The woman that was attempting to help me was rude and very condescending of any questions I had I was told it would be delivered that day but I had to pay in cash and 75 If I hadnt been sleeping on the floor for the last few days I would have put up a fight I was refused a receipt when I asked for one from the delivery guy who was a salesman at the store who had just thrown the mattress and boxspring on top of his Jeep Cherokee
Would not recommend to anyone
Took my payment waited several days to tell me they didnt have the prescription Waited several more days to tell me it was expired Eventually just had to cancel order
Order some contacts and it said it would be in with in 510 business days still waiting for them and its almost been a month Its more accurate if it said 25weeks
Bravo Fly was unable to provide me with the ordered tickets due to price changes price doubled over night according to them but they were the only company with that ridiculously low price on the day of booking and therefore cancelled the booking  but they draw the money
It costs money to call their servicedesk and I havent been able to get through to anyone yet It was in October I will now have to ask my bank to get my money back and file a complaint
Love the quality of the clothes but it is so frustrating  Fabletics knows my size and yet shows me outfits that are out of stock and it isnt apparent until you click on each item
The prices are good and the quality excellent  styles range from unique and cute to boring just wish the out old of stock style would be moved to SALE and allow the user to shop for only what is available in their size

Customs charges should have been informed at postage
We used Airhotels on our project Doozze
Agreements and deadlines are not met the work is sloppy and takes months to fix The staff that was appointed to me needed to be continuously micromanaged and bugs and mistakes popped up persistently
I would not work with them again nor would I recommend anyone else to do so
To make matters worse theyve been using our project as a featured case study without our consent and have failed to remove it from their website after repeated requests
Edit Apptha has proceeded to remove our company from their website and has apologized for any inconvenience this misunderstanding has caused

We are surprised the see in the voucher a far higher price than given on the Airport Rental Car homepage were a discount price 364561 DDK versus now 4220 DKK  now immediately charged to my credit card occurred

I recently had an item delivered to my house No evidence of a package at my house and no evidence that anyone even attempted to access my house recent snowfall After a supposed trace they patted themselves on the back and declared they were not at fault for the lost item Would only recommend purolator if you dont want to receive your item and want poor customer service
My order was accepted as earrings were in stock when I ordered My money was also accepted then 2 days later I received an email stating that they were out of stock and my money was refunded I felt it was false advertising and I told my mother i bought these earrings for her birthday I will never purchase from Argento again or recommend their site to anyone else Rachel Lattimore from Dunlin
Unfortunately I was a regular customer but suddenly free shipping is not no give I have not received your order a month no explanations from the snusline not recommended
Not only did they deliver the wrong item they charge a 60 cash delivery fee which was a surprise and then on the second delivery which I had to pay for again the item was missing all of the screws to put the chairs together

Deception in the details of Alibaba  Aliexpress  GlobalSource articles
Finally it is important to know that these websites the B2b and B2C traent That is you can negotiate prices also note that 56 of sellers do not adhere to the price range for the same quantity
For example you see
US  299999  Piece
Minimum order 100pcs
When you enter into communication with the seller the prices are above the maximum promised
This is a technique to attract you but especially that indicates that this seller is not honest
if the price quotation is over the price when applying for listing for the same minimum order do not do business with that seller who is not honest
It is necessary to look at the descriptive of the articles sold more than
72 of the articles use false descriptive for example TV LED and in reality it is of the LCD type False images that are usually taken on branded brand products like Samsung LG etc

Do not book through flight hub We booked a flight through flight hub We could not board the flight and flight hub could not change the flight while we were panicking at the airport or give a refund They were so rude on the phone and I called them many times I would strongly urge not to use this website
Ovet a week to package one single plastic part before shipping it Amazon they arent I ordered a whole piece of equipment from anothet vendor the same day that wieghed 500 lb It arrived before this 5 oz piece of plastic was even pulled Last time I order from them
Update The excuses they listed below are invalid My complaint is not with the delivery but in the processing time Item ordered just after lunch on wed 8th On mon the 13th I got an email saying the item has shipped They attached a tracking number from a second party vendor that says dilevery was on the 13th which it wasnt How can an item be shipped and delivered same day It would seem they dont communicate with their second padty vendors
The part is not needed for another 5 days My complaint is not in the delivery its in their paperwork Plus the tracking number says delivered yesterday We get UPS everyday and the package was not in it The complaint is between them and their vendor and email to me the customer

Took phone in for diagnosis told me it was charging port authorized repair for 90 dollars quick turn around was told it was repaired and could pu after 2pm Picked up and charge cord would no longer fit into port home button is recessed and scratches all around edges and wont charge This phone was always kept in case and was in excellent condition Then and they told me they were going to refund total BUT would take several days WHY charged my account before repair was even attempted why should I wait 5 days to get my money back phone not fixed and even damaged This was my 2nd experience with fox paw 1st excellent 2nd time terrible I question if I would try them again Very disappointed
I ordered five books and three of the five books arrived in horrible condition They were listed as good condition All of the books were disgustingly dirty One had food and rips on every page One board book had only one page that was not tore in half Do they even check their books before shipping
Our 1st order from them we just ordered 24 shirts They only delivered 12 When I contacted them they didnt give me a reason but assured me we would have the rest in time before our event Needless to say they failed miserably Got the rest of the order the day after our event When I contacted them again about this I basically got a response of what do you want me to do about it and an insincere sorry Then told me the original reason we didnt get them all is because they didnt have the product to complete the order So why was I not contacted about that or given an option to change the order to get things in time This company will waste your time and money Use someone else
Very poor my email was corrupted some overseas person used it to sell stuff via my emailThen gumtree wouldnt give me access to their site for me to sell things They wouldnt let me even with another email address Fixing the email problems took me a long time it was their fault and they gave me no help I have wasted a lot of time on this  it has cost me a lot of money

Ordered a printer and cartridge and took 10 days to deliver the order
No response to emails or phone calls on status of my order
In todays world a decent internet company should be able to deliver in 2448 hours and communicate on the status of an order
I placed an order and received wrong item After being on phone for 28 minutes to try and resolve situation they assured me correct item would be sent After numerous calls made by me still havent received item and still dont know status of order Onceif this gets resolved Im done with MedMart
I needed to get in contact with customer service and discovered how bad that was
1 Needed to remove VAT because it was a company transaction where I send proof of company but still the withdraw the whole amount from the Visa and never acknowledged my messages
2 Ordered a bag 14 before I needed it but then 7 days later they change the delivery time on the homepage without telling me that it was not in stock and they needed to get it to their warehouse Again a simple email to me would have been sufficient
They have lost my trust to handle customer service but do have cheap prices compared to other sites and I have made transaction before with I got but be aware of the services if somethings goes wrong 
Ordered 2 yrs ago Went fine Now its impossible to order
I am extremely disappointed in the service I have received from Last Minute I booked a hotel on their website and then realised that I had put in the incorrect dates so I called them within 2 minutes to make the changes They contacted the hotel who agreed not to put through any penalty rates to make the change in dates and that I could either select a 1 bedroom apartment for similar value or upgrade to a two bedroom dual key unit which was 1618 I then asked them to make notes on the file about the discussion and said I would think about it They said they would I called back the next day Last Minute had to contact Castlereagh Oaks to reconfirmed what was arranged the day before as notes had not been made on the file When they contacted the hotel Castlereagh Oaks decided I could upgrade from my two bedroom unit at 963 I would only be charged for the difference between the two prices however the Oaks Castlereagh now decided to add on a penalty of 50 which Last Minute decided to give me a discount for Last Minute made the booking I then checked my credit card later that night only to discover I was charged 963 plus 1618 I phoned them immediately They then said that they had to listen to the telephone messages to see what has happened but not to worry that the matter will be resolved and I would receive my money back I then received an email saying that I sent a copy of my back statements from another email address not registered on the system and that I would have to start the process all over again I then called Last Minute to resolve the matter They contacted the Oaks Castlereagh again who now decided that I have two bookings with them and that they were not prepared to cancel either of them I am so disappointed as I am now out of pocket 1618 plus 963 Last Minute has yet to come back to me to resolve this I am so upset about this as money was taken from my account without authority and now I have to spend endless hours on the phone trying to resolve this I am also disappointed in the attitude of the Oaks Castlereagh who are taking advantage of the situation
I invest on many platforms but this platform is the worst Half of your invested funds are stolen by thiefs half of it returns in long horizon There is no buyback guarantee and loans are only few As an investor you dont know whats happen with every loan And debt agency gets 2030 percent of stake
They are not cared about investors at all Just read angry comments on everybody profiles before you invest here Their responsibilities are nothing  read in Terms and conditions  all risk is on investors
I read references on TrustPilot and they are absolutely out  Nobody is talking about how much percent they actually make from this investments I lost there so far about 70 of what I invest Looks like for me this company makes their own reviews Dont trust them
Got a Quote for car insurance and saved it in their system created an account
Tried to retrieve the Quote 30mins later to make a purchase but the Quote has gone up by 165euro within 30 minutes no changes made in the meantime
Contacted them by mail they rang me back the following day couldnt answer
Contacted them via web chat  they changed Quote back to what it was originally but could not explain what had happened
Chat with start time 1229 GMT 22nd Feb 2017
Decided to proceed  made the purchase as it was good price after they lowered it back to original but if I didnt pursue it I would have ended up paying 165 more
Had a similar story with Liberty Insurance their price going up  down I guess if you dont do proper research  ask questions you end up overpaying for insurance regardless of which company you choose
I would give 4 stars for value  1 start for transparency  customer support
I was in Australia on holiday and was told by Vision Direct they would arrive within 23 days but they never arrived and caused me no end of problems
8 days later after I left the country they finally arrived The tracking system was terrible as it just said not scanned at this time which meant no one knew where they were and they were complete waste of time and money as I wont be back in the country for a long while
At first I was really looking forward to using this company excitement soon turned to frustration They sent me my lockbox I set up my first dog walk for my 2 year old lab when I got the notification that my dogs walk was over I came home to find a walker and my dog both stuck outside of my house because the lock box that they had given to me was broken and she couldnt get my house key out of it I soon sent her home and told her that my husband would be home soon so not to worry about it I contacted Wag I was hung up on twice they didnt seem to really give a crap that I was locked outside of my house with my eightmonthold and it was getting cold out My husband didnt end up coming home for another 45 minutes and during that time I had called Wag a few more times trying to speak with someone higher than the people they were giving me two nobody seems to care they literally told me to let them know how it goes My husband ended up getting home and breaking the lock so that we could get inside of our house they never called me to check up and see how things were going I had my second wags walk scheduled and I had to be home to let the dog walker inside of my house because nobody cared to send me a new lock box either This company is poorly thrown together You dont even get to speak with the dog walker before they come inside of your home and walk your dog theres no way to coordinate with the dog walker either wont be recommending this company to anyone anytime soon
Ordred printer cartridges they never turned up yet you want me to review them
Where are they
Nothing should be this convoluted I was made to feel like I was perpetrating some kind of fraud Delay followed delay which increased my out of pocket costs and without the persistence of my primary contact this transaction would never have taken place
The worst experience I have ever had The ticket master was very rude and impolite I along with my cousins we were heading to food bar to have some coffee and sandwiches but on the way one of the ticket master asked for our tickets which is fine but when we said we got tickets but we have left it in our seats he replied to us syaing that we need tickets and you should go and get back the tickets or you should carry your seats Carry your seats That doesnt even make sense The ticket master was very rude and he seemed to have a very unpleasant behaviour Never going to travel with Thayls again
I have used shipito to send 15000 USD worth of items Everything goes well and requests are done on a quite effective manner until something went wrong
When came the time to send my shipments most of the packs left their warehouse and tracking got updated except for one pack I have followed their process and raise a ticket to understand what was happening As I received no answer I contacted their online support to get more information
Good point their online support is effective and people can be spoken to relatively fast Bad point theyre not helpful as they depend on their local staff within warehouses to handle requests and it seems that those local staff have no willingness to answer
I finally got my pack the tracking number was incorrect However this makes me cautious when dealing with such people  if my pack were really lost I wonder how they would have reacted Not mentioning that they have managed to make one mistake out of ten packs  ie 10 of failure on my case Bad luck Does not seem so when reading all other reviews
I wont use them again for shipping tens of thousands of USD worth of items to be honest
They offer insurance which are not recognized by rental company and rental company charged me additional insurance when I contacted them they were not able to help me

Like other people below I made my car rental booking through an online broker  DoYouItaly  they offered a full Allianz insurance that I accepted and paid 2780 Yet upon my arrival at the Goldcar desk in Bologna the vendor advised  while showing a leaflet and a breakdown detail  that the full insurance sold by their Spanish partner wasnt enough to cover 100  of contingencies He the offered a further insurance policy worth 9504 and suggested to get in touch with the broker DoYouItaly to raise a claim which I did before the end of that day The broker answered in real time they rejected the refund I requested and explained they were aware of the extra business made by Goldcar through the insurance charges
Needless to say  Goldcar did not refund the double insurance as I asked them to do
I made a booking today for travel tomorrow but only after Id received the confirmation email did I realise I had already made the booking for the same train on this site a couple of months ago
Of course this was my mistake but since I had booked two tickets for the same identical train with the same identical passenger names and the same identical email address you would have hoped that the site might have noticed
As it stands I refunded one set of tickets and had to pay a 10euro penalty
So while it was my stupidity that was entirely to blame I just wish the site could have helped me out a bit

I would give this service zero stars if it was possible After a month I still havent received my code They wont give me my money back

I bought tickets for homewood ski resort near tahoe a huge storm closed the resort the day before i arrived when i arrived they were open with about 10 of the mountain but ski lessons were closed which i had bought for my daughters homewood let me change the date of the ski lessons but liftopia would not let me change my lift ticket they said the resort is open and thats all they need to keep my money these peoples business model is to use any excuse to keep your money i dont like organizations like that i understand money is important but i hope that enough people giving them bad reviews for this behavior will cause them to lose enough money that they change
You cant cancel your order online Long story short I accidentally placed a order a item on my wishlist I called to cancel right away and center was closed I called the next morning and it was too late I have to wait until item gets here and refuse package and than still have to wait refund to get processed
Placed an order 130 via Speedgears website that listed an item in stock and received a confirmation for the order and anticipated ship time of 39 days On 213 I called to check the order status and was told the item was expected in stock today 217 and it would ship then Today 217 I received an email saying the order would not be filled and was cancelled This was a birthday gift and the item is not available If I had known 2 weeks ago I could have purchased it from another site that had the item in stock then Obviously I will not patronize this company in the future Fabulous customer service Long live impersonal mediocrity
I am paying 83 dollars for 5050 internet that was claimed to be 5999 what a joke of a company Ive been fighting with this company since march of 2016 Every month I make a call about something wrong with my bill Well we are done we are going to be looking elsewhere I urge people do not become a customer with frontier you will regret it
My account was suspended in Dec 21 2016 due to IP infringement and I was told there were a 60 chance to get it reinstated so I paid the 24 hr service of 599 to get a plan of action letter and submitted to Amazon After 6 weeks waiting and it seemed that my account suspended foreverHello We reviewed your account and the information you provided and we have decided that you may not sell on Amazoncom We may not respond to further emails about this issue Contacted amazonappealcom through the email but could not get any response from them it seems they will not take care of your case once you got the decision letter from Amazon very sad
A waste of my money
I repeatably discussed not having the parts shipped to my office and the order taker kept saying no problem but they were shipped to my office regardless Order takers need to speak and understand better English Lesson learned
it seems there are a lot of add ons to the basic price that make this choice more expensive than it seems
I have been having a horrible time with this company I ordered 55 travel cups of which 78 were misaligned I called on Friday and send pictures of some of the cups and was told I would be contacted within 24 hours 24 hours lated and no phone call I called again on Monday and was told that I would get a callback in a couple of hours but still no callback I called again this morning and was told that they apparently overlooked my pictures and that I would get a call back today but I never did I called back only to be informed that the claims department was close for the day I needed these cups starting last Thursday when they arrived and told them of my urgency to at least have them ready by this coming Thursday but yet they havent done anything to resolve my issue I am really disappointed with this order and their service I recommend you use other places to get your correct order in a timely fashion

Kiddies Kingdom sent out the wrong item so I called customer services and was on hold for 10 minutes before I decided to hang up Emailed them twice before I received a response Was then asked to take a photo of the wrong item sent and email it to them before they would advise me on the next steps The next day received an email asking me to courier the item back to them BEFORE they would send out the original item Id ordered and already paid for I emailed saying I would post the item back but found it unacceptable that I would be made to wait for my original item to be sent to me until they had received it due to their error I didnt receive a reply 11 days since my order and it STILL hasnt been resolved Shocking customer service
From the moment we entered the vacation rental we found the place to be dirty meaning feces on toilets etc Unfortunately we were at the vacation home during the hurricane and lost 3 nights of stay which we were told by the company we would be reimbursed for NOT Prior to hurricane we called many times to ask what we should do to the house to prepare and the one time someone answered we were told they are taking care of the more elite properties first So I guess because we were in a bronze property we didnt count as humans The company has stopped accepting my calls are ignoring my emails and will not communicate with me to resolve this issue

We have enjoyed Malta but not our hotel experience
The quality of the room and the service at the reception was unacceptable
receptionist was rude car attend was on his phone did not acknowledge that I was there then the car someone had smoked in it 
I had high hopes based on other reviews
The ordering process was great
Then the problems started
It took OVER 4 weeks for the bed to arrive
Finally we received our bed and one side of the pump does not work with Bluetooth
I called customer support and they asked me to capture a video and send it to them  to prove that Im not lying I sent the video as asked I had no follow up From Personal Comfort
After several days I called again and was told that the person I originally talked to would call me back in like 15 minutes Again Never got a call
Now I will be calling a 3rd time
Furthermore the bed itself has been very hard to adjust Much more difficult than the sleep number that we tested in the showroom And the pump is really noisy Dont run it at night or you will wake up your spouse
The A6 bed which was recommended is not plush at all The same customer service rep offered to upgrade us to the A8 But again it as been a couple weeks and we have not seen any email or received anything making good on that promise Very Very Very Disappointed
Arrived well packed and in a nice box but does not charge turn on or otherwise Site keeps crashing when logging in or trying to log support Online LIVE chat offline so just a message option not great so far

All was fine until I got home to at 12799 charge called up to extend our rental by one day Sure its all done for you at 26 EUR Return the car get home told weve been charged for late return and also over mileage
Never once was it clear on the site for limited mileage its down in the small printterms  should be much clearer really considering most rental companies allow you to drive their car like a normal car as much as you want
UPDATE They say they are happy to look into the matter however when posting this original review I had already had a couple emails back and forth yet they ignore most of my valid points such as the fact I called them to extend the rental and they processed it
They are unprofessional thieves and con artists at the end of the day AVOID AT ALL COSTS
After 25 weeks not even sure if their service works they dont respond to my inquiries

Opticon did not notify me that they did not reach my eye doctor to obtain my prescription I did not receive the multifocal lens 150 HGH that I thought I was ordering Now I have to use my glasses plus the contacts I was just told by customer service that I cant return the unopened boxes Terrible customer service
Cash gold price was 1130 Offered me 690 an ounce
I received 2 boxes of lenses one was colored light blue and labeled made in the USA the other was labeled made in Ireland with a dark blue color scheme I was concerned about why the packages were different and they were from different countries so I email them to inquire and never heard back The box from Ireland was also discolored with yellowing on the bar code This made me suspicious I wont order from them again
Me and a friend went onto sky scanner and were directed to use Bravofly to book our flights Both separately booking onto the same flight we were surprised when after wed made the payment and the money had been taken that our flight was merely a request and we were still waiting to see if it had actually been confirmed even though the money had been taken out once we called our bank My friend has since found out her request was not processed so shell be getting her money back within 23 days Whereas I am still yet to find out if Im even on the flight at all Such a waste of time Hugely disappointing Avoid Bravofly at absolutely all costs

Made an order on a Saturday Wasnt shipped until the following Wednesday I had previously ordered from this company where the order went through but it turned out the exact racquet was not in stock I half assumed this had happened again and so called up to check but no it was just slow to dispatch
Upon arrival I opened the box to find the racquet not a cheap one in just a polythene bag  it was just free to move around and hit against the sides of the large nonpadded cardboard box Lucky it survived the journey in tact
Recently received the detachable derby house pro rug and when the neck is attached by clipping the D rings the horse puts her neck down revealing her neck
After speaking to customer service at derby house i was told i couldnt get a refund straight away because if there is a fault with the rug it needs sending off for tests I clipped my horse the day the rug arrived but before she had been turned out after throwing her old one that was ripped i was left with no choice but to keep the rug because i had nothing warm enough to put her in whilst derby house tested the rug Crap customer service
After having a previously bad experience when ordering from derby house i thought id give them a second chance but not a third never again

We tried to order a part for our mP10i It took 5 business days to get customer care to call us back because the higher ups were in Vegas for a show So I guess everyone at anajet customer care had to take off too When I finally got to order the part they said they would ship it next day air for free It was 5 days later and no part so I emailed or Rep and he said There are still some changes occurring here at Anajet in terms of production and shipping and we are just working out some minor details It now is almost a month later and still no part We can still print without the part but still come on what the HELL I will no longer recommend this company to anyone any more
The price for flight is cheap and comfortable
Decided to get myself a few steam codes off these guys waited over a week to finally receive my codes Only problem was that none of the codes worked at all and had already been claimed Have sent numerous support tickets only to just be ignored have asked for a refund but still no sign of wanting to fix the problem Nothing but a scam these people are dont buy from them and waste your money
I ordered a car radio bluetooth at tomtop and after mounting in my car when I am stopped it worked very well but when I roll it is only cut I reported it to customer service and the only answer it gave me is to go and get it mounted at a professional As if I was not able to plug a pin to a car radio 
I even sent them a video to show them the problem
Then I had to send him back at my own expense
To finish I have a radio car that stays in the closet
Thank you TOMTOP 
Sooo basically I got my brakes replaced because not only they needed to be replaced but because they had annoying squeaking noise At first it wasnt making noise but a day later it was more squeking than before it used to be once in a while now its everytime I brake and now its another noise  whistling more noise added Its worse than before and its embarrassing  so basically the mechanic screwed me over and they are charging me 80 for another crappy mechanic I WILL NEVER RETURN OR HAVE ANY OF THEM WORK ON MY CAR AGAIN JUST GO TO THE SHOP I HAD TO LEARN THE HARD WAY Now either I have to work on it myself or pay money at the shop they put me in a bad situation Either way I would have been paying the same amount your mechanic170 80250 shop SEARS  300only a 50 difference but at least you can be sure to have good service free of defects and they will make it better not worse
From Paris gare de Lyon to Paris Nord is not a walking distance Paris subway is a necessity This is critical Information for every traveler and missing in overview Very disappointing
One4all much better You get a card that you can use in shops or online No need to register to use it
Allgifts are a pain to use You have to register in advance and then you can only use them online Plus the selection of stores is more limited
Have no idea why management chose to use them
They were real helpful until they got my payment then it was fast talking jerberish with no explanation of what they were doingIm not a lawyer and they talk like you should understand like one
had to keep asking for all the parts got all but one set good enough
This was not a great purchase We are disappointed in the 31 Vape The liquid drips out the dry herb compartment burns it triple fast The wax compartment doesnt fit the wax we buy We are so bummed out 
Ive gotta say I work as a designer and developer for the direct response industry and Ive never come across something as deliberately misleading as Fabletics Id heard the bad reviews ex Oh you have to reject every month or theyll charge you but I found something I liked and I figured they were at least being up front about their business practice so I gave it a shot I got my first outfit and then kept up with skipping each month as I got the email at the first of each month I liked the leggings I got skipping each month was easy I didnt understand why people complained so much
Then something happened About a week or so into the month I saw that I had a 50 charge on my credit card from Fabletics which just happened to overdraw my account so thanks for that How could that be I had been doing so well at skipping each month and I remembered doing it that month But I didnt want to be one of those whiners I knew what I signed up for and must have a had a bad internet connection or maybe I clicked the link in my email but forgot to click the skip button on the website I made up a bunch of scenarios to justify it as my mistake
Next month I realized what happened Without any warning Fabletics added an extra splash page after you click the Skip this month button Yet another page comes up asking do you REALLY want to skip this month  YES I couldnt believe it I was tricked I thought about how much of an increase Fabletics must have seen in their sales that month just by adding that page Them  laughing at their ingenious marketing skills while Im crying because my account was overdrawn again
Whatever I thought I did like those leggings I got originally so now I just have an excuse to buy some more I decided to wait for a good sale to come around so I could get the most for my money Buy one outfit get one free my email said Perfect Ill get two outfits with my 50 credit then close my account and be done with this whole mess
So there I am two outfits in my cart totaling 50 when I see a little blurb You have a credit you could use you are currently using a BOGO promotion Oh ok so thats how I use my credit I click it My cart is still totaling 50 Now the blurb says There is a BOGO promotion you could use You are currently using a credit Here is where I lose my sh t
Are you effing kidding me I cant use both I have paid this company 50 just because they tricked me and now theyre telling me I can only use that money on certain things Two outfits BOGO is 50 I have paid them 50 But no Not on that
So fine I put two pairs of capris from your sale section in my cart no promotion needed used my credit and now I am DONE Aside from the fact that your entire business model is built on trusting people to be idiots your site is incredibly hard to use I specialize in UI and UX and jesus I couldnt get from one section to another I constantly had rollovers blocking the whole page anytime my mouse went over the top half of the page it was impossible to tell which items were on sale and which ones werent although I assume that bit is on purpose and just all around I had a terrible experience Even checking out I got several error pages by no fault of my own before I could place my order And despite my password being saved on chrome one day it just didnt work anymore And when I clicked forgot password I never got an email sent to me Not even in my spam folder I had to talk to customer service to reset my password It was ludicrous
Anyway youre terrible and despite the fact that your clothes are in fact decent quality I will never shop here again
Ordered 2x selfie drones payed for fast delivery well ahead of Christmas they never turned up Tomtop never replied to my emails luckily I payed via
PayPal had to lodge a complaint and received a refund
my advice do not buy from this company
I have been on the website called their HQ and called the local store
If the website tells you the local store doesnt have an item in stock so best to email or call this HQ number wholl be able to get the item to the store for pick up asap you expect to be able to do this Not get connected to someone at HQ saying they dont know what the website is referring to and cant do what it claims but please call the local store instead
So I call the local store who would like to help but all their orders have to come from Melbourne and if they dont gave it have to in turn order from HQ which can take a couple of months
So The local store gets a bad logistical deal and HQ doesnt know what its own website is claiming So much room for improvement guys
Very bad service all round I got ink for a brother printer over a month ago the black did not work so got sent another pack still did not work but my one still works I then was asked to send back both packs and I would get credit on my account to get ink for a different printer that has not happen and now I dont even get a respond to emails about following it up so this is why I give u a bad report oh fill free to follow this up as Im still waiting RE 11236395 Re 11189026 Re 11188946 Re 11041898 Re 11041717 Re 11041365 Ink RE 11324307
They have the worst customer support To find a way to get to them takes away all your patience I am a new customer and trying to redeem a voucher Also I closed my account with G3 telecom services to sign up with rebtel I used 2 vouchers and none of them worked I was without any telecom services for about a day and I had to call my parents in India They provide expired codes to our company maybe so that people like us would sign up for an account and then bam That is it you dont get any credit against that voucher I had to flip through the FAQs read help articles and then they thought they had their fun so after 15 minutes of struggle the website gave me chat option I still wasnt losing faith in them I talked to an agent and he was rude and absurd I even told him how important it was for me to make a call to India He was totally helpless and I dont even think how to treat customers He didnt even what I was talking about When I thought he is not helping me out I rated him 1 star and ended the conversation He came back to me saying I was rude for giving him 1 star and that he was thinking of giving me some credit That was unacceptable since I did not want to talk to him and ended the chat he had no right to reopen the chat and send me messages Also there is technically no way that you can end a chat except by closing out the website I would suggest them to hire more polite reps and also train them to help us out better
Two weeks ago I noticed that 100 had been taken out of my bank account from my joint account which was not registered by me or my wife who does not gamble I contacted Paddy Power who said they would look into it chasing them 3 days later they wanted a form filled in which I did immediately I resent this as for 15 hours they said they hadnt received it I chased them by phone and email on several occasions My account was suspended No replies were received from PP Totally ignorant I have just received a reply were they stated they can see no wrong usage on the account and for me to contact the police Also when I agree no action is needed they will unlock my account
I replied that I would not be using them any more
I believe their systems have been compromised
I also saw another account has complained about hacking
From mine and other complaints I suggest as many people as possible avoid Paddy Power at all costs
Thought we found an app that would alert us to good prices on Las Vegas hotels We entered our dates and found a great deal on the hotel we wanted to stay in ALMOST booked it and then noticed that the dates had been changed We would have paid for rooms that we werent able to stay in since our flights are booked Tried 4 times and each time the dates changed from the ones we had entered Deleted this app
I ordered 3 items on January 7 and it still shows processing if that is the best you can do I will not do any more business with you
My experience is the same as everyone else who has rated it poorly
Box never showed up during the 12am  7am allotted time Waited all day because of the heat Rang them in the afternoon and was told theyll investigate and call me back Still no communication from them over the next 24hrs Rang them back only to be told that my box had been damaged in transit and the driver thought it was better not to deliver it Thats fine with me but a simple phone call text message or email to let me know what was going on seems to be a bit much to ask from them Im disappointed to say the least I work when the shops are closed and Im sleeping while they are open To have everything here when I get up instead of doing the mad dash at 945pm to the supermarket was supposed to be convenient not more stressful
Hired a car from the Alicante office 211216
Returned it undamaged 261216
It is now 020217 and I have not received the 950 Euro deposit they forced me to pay not block like all the others I have used
I have now sent several emails to both Dickmanns and Do You Spain and have no sign of the refund Dickmanns have not bothered to reply to me
I am now going to have to start dispute proceedings to recover the money
The response form Dickmanns is untrue
I was told at the desk that the refund would be made in 4 weeks MAXIMUM
Not 28 to 30 working days as is claimed
The refund should have been made 26012017 at the very latest
Why has it not been returned
Why did I not get even an acknowledgement of my first email
Why have I now had an email saying this has been passed to your accounts department
Why have I not received my refund
I have used Dickmanns before and no deposit was charged
Drivalia do not charge a deposit at Alicante I have used these
Gold Car do not charge a deposit at Alicante I have used these
Record do not charge a deposit at Alicante I have used these
Solmar do not charge a Deposit at Alicante I have used these
They will be getting my business in April June September and December this year
Dickmanns will not
Reservation was false Manager said that no unit was available when i went to claim
The agent who called to me ticked all the yes boxes without consulting me or drawing attention to penalty clause A short time after joining September 2015 I informed the company that the door of my meter box was broken I was assured that it would be repaired at no cost to me this has not happened as a result I cannot open it to submit meter reading
Had nothing but issues with hosting and support
I purchased ticket to go to Havana via Atlanta from those people
Since I am a Canadian I was informed that I did not need any visa
But later I found out none of tourists are eligible to go to Cuba once you stop over in US
They are selling that kind of ticket without any notice and still says no refund
Such a ripoff
Been using their Creme Abricot nail cream for decades Ordered it by phone after ordering on the website would not take my state Gave the rep all of my info including billing info Got an email almost a week later saying the order was cancelled as it was not in stock Both the website and the rep said it was in stock Something is wrong with the tech support for Dior I have since moved on and tried a different product Its not as good DIOR GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER This sucked And btw I am divorced I dont like that there is not a Ms title option I am not a Miss or a Mrs
I have been a member of the Candy Club for six months Some of the candy I like some I dont This last box was extremely disappointing I take the time to rate the candies I receive If I give a candy one star I really dont expect to see it again Low and behold this month I received one of the candies I rated one star AGAIN Not only that but I have received the same licorice pinwheels for 3 of the six months that I have been getting shipments which leads me to believe that they dont have much variety Really The same candy 3 times in 6 months
Ticket 2017021610036736
I was told by bravofly that my refund is complete and that they have double checked it but I am not able to see the amount in my statement
Now my bank has asked for the transaction IDSWIFT ID for the refund transaction so that they can look into the matter I have been calling customer care for this for the past 5 days I have also mailed my request by replying to an email for the above ticket ID but I have yet not received any answer even though I was told that I would get one in 72 hours
It is my hard earned money and I expect your cooperation in this regards Please provide me with the ID as soon as possible
The Wunder2 was Not so good because it are Bad to make it one the Eyebrows
After ordering and paying for my purchase I get a phone calk 2 days later saying there sorry but the item is sold outit should never have been Sold in the first place
Crazy Factory basically stole my money and are now ignorning every one of my emails I ordered 2 weeks ago and for 3 days Ive been trying to contact them Website says MondayFriday theyre available and 24 hours max before they respond and its been 3 days and I have gotten nothomg from them There isnt even a way to track your package online for them so I have no idea where my package is no way of finding it and questioning if this is even a real site They took my payment and I got nothing
Took 58 min to book it and I had to inform them of available discounts
roses are dead limp ugly after just one day And now cant even get company on the phone
I booked a flight for myself and my father online with Travelocity and purchased cancellation insurance and the works to ensure I had myself covered Two days before we were to travel my father passed away I attempted to contact Travelocity to cancel his flight but they said the email address I was giving did not correspond with my account Strange since I had the itinerary right there in my inbox I had all the information including the credit card number booking number my phone number our names address everything you name it Just not the email address Im assuming there was some sort of technical glitch But no matter how high up the chain I tried to go they simply did not help me The airline said their hands were tied and they could not help either as the ticket was still in the hands of travelocityca I tried to explain to get help I tried everything They even hung up on me several times I would NOT recommend Travelocity to ANYONE There are plenty of other options out there dont make the same mistake I did
Phone at Xmas for holliday they said they come back to me They email me 4 weeks later saying do I still want the holiday when want to go away for new year to Dominican republic so booked it else were
I purchased a drone from RC Planet Not only did they not send the correct one but they failed to reinburse me for the returned item until I contacted them to ask them to do so which was WEEKS after they had received the returned item If I had not contacted them I probably would have never been reinbursed Very disappointing and the people in customer service couldnt have cared less about the situation
I am in Australia and because there is no 24 hr chat the response time is slow and if you need to have a chat about something it can take daysreally frustrating
No wonder people give up on blogging
Will continuely charge credit card whenever a vip credit is used
I ordered a pair of KYB rear shocks for my sons 06 Mustang After jacking up the car and almost removing factory shocks I decided to open the boxes One shock had the hardware inside the other did not So must for finishing the job with my son Had to email help desk to hopefully get hardware bag set to me ASAP
I checked to see what restaurants were still open and delivering to my area I put an order in and after 20 minutes I get a phone call saying they dont deliver to my area Not good enough
Final page on your website makes payment difficult It refuses payment on the basis that some information is missing when in fact it is present Customer has to delete several fields and reenter the information and continue repeating the process before payment is accepted
I was about to give up and move to another supplier when I managed to finally make the payment A few weeks ago I did abandon a rental and go to another provider for the same reasons
I booked a car for a weekend only to find out the day before arriving that insurance was extra but optional which is fine although it would have been nice to receive the option upfront when booking to have known about the extra cost I was then told when I arrived that 200 would be held against my credit card for two weeks Yet another piece of information that would have been nice to know in advance
Then to top it off I was given a car that had no damage Yeah right Good thing I checked it over There were three areas I found that were damaged All external and none of which effected the driving or safety of the car But after being misled twice already I wasnt taking any chances of being held accountable for something I didnt do It made me wonder if because I declined the offer of their insurance maybe the damage had been done y someone who did pay for insurance and they needed someone else to pin it on Im not saying they would have but the mistrust I now had in them made me wonder
amazing cant add a bad review because hungrynl removes this
I will share the complainments on social media
I agree with the many other comments on here
I had a flight with Emirates but somehow got it operated by Qantas from Dubai to London on 31st January 2017 It looked nice to see Air Bus A380 and I was hoping it will have same service level as Emirates but seats were congested  small screens with limited entertainment
Worst part was flight crew had no idea what were they doing I was on Seat 71K Window seat and every other passenger from here and there kept on saying if i could closed the window passenger behind me pushed my seat and said he is too tall so I shouldnt push my seat behind
I went to cabin crew and reported this and he said dont worry when we serve food we will look into it REALLY They never bothered to come the lady in front of my seat was sleeping so her seat was on my knees and passenger behind me was arguing but I had paid for the seat so I pushed my seat back as well and then crew came after 25 hours when flight was nearly landing at London
They had limited food a passenger next to me wanted Fish Dory and was informed by crew that they dont have any more and passenger should wait until premium passengers finish if anything is left then he can have it
I felt it was worst than easy jet Emirates is far better airline and their services are world class
Will never fly again in Qantas and recommend others not to fly with them
It used to be very good before but recently started facing issues calling India  Will never refer it to anyone and loose my word  Once m done with my credit  will move to another provider 
Thanks  Please maintain stuff so that you dont loose customers
If you have to have a review you are not watching how your customers pay their accounts or keep in credit or out of it
I recently bought tickets to see Bruce Springsteen I was so excited to get tickets that I didnt realise I had a bought mine through resale not because all the tickets had sold but because it was a way for the seller to make more money You can imagine my dismay when better cheaper seats were on sale Why were seats on resale wont be doing that again
Customer should always be able to view final order and cost of shipment and total cost before placement of order Within a reasonable amount of time  30 minutes or so  customer should be able to cancel order
Just booked been sent a confirmation email Two hours layer I get two emails saying its been cancelled because they cant verify my card and give me a dodgy link to a worldpay site My card statement shows the transaction is going through however it is a holding payment What is going on Im not paying a penny more I dont seem to be able to find customer service contacts Another nightmare online company
I bought a bag from here it said it was in stock it wasnt I had to wait for the stock it was like they were making the bag When the bag arrived 7 days later it was a miniature version of the bag The picture was of the bag was actually quite big I feel like I was conned I couldnt find anywhere to rate the bag so the only way is to rate the website itself
First let me start off with the hold they put on your card for incidentals 200 Which i have stayed at many many hotel including other Sheratons and the hold normally falls off a day later
Now i not going to trash the place because of an issue but i going to just going to talk about my issue Me and my wife stay there for two nights we both are smokers and even at our own home we dont smoke inside of the house We was falsely accused of smoking in the room and the hold was not released from my card We start calling to see why the hold was still there we was told it will take an extra day because of the holiday We call back a day later and was suppose to receive call back okay so we called them back and this is when things got out of hand We was told that we was smoking in the room and that they had pictures from there investigation Now there investigation consisted of an empty cigarette pack in the trash and the candles and inscent that was left in the room No butts no ashes from cigarettes How ever i was told that they did not allow burning of candles at the hotel but there is not a policy or rule to support this SO I WOULD NOT STAY HERE EVER
A few days before our trip I rented from Hertz through Airport rentals a 44 car My arrival time to Costa Rica was 5 pm  when I arrived to the Hertz counter I was told they did not have the car I reserved for 19600 After showing my reservation and half an hour of discussions and arguments the attendant said he could offer another similar car but the cost would be around 450 Very upsetting Needless to say I did not rent from Hertz
Unfortunately I was warned about these gimmicks in Costa Rica but did not think it would happen to me since I was using reliable companies but
I clicked on Avas ad in google The low price was a sham with the wrong picture I paid for fast delivery handling fees and other bs add ons They delivered very late and order was incomplete No response to emailed complaint Phone number cant reach any one Do not deal with this company
Flowers not delivered to the address specified
Would like a full refund
Paid my money then tried to register My email address password and registration number were classed as invalid tried umpteen times without success Asked for a refund but found complication there Now wondering if there is any chance of this being sorted out
The box was very badly damaged and upon inspection I found the cupboard was damaged I contacted Hallowood and they arranged for a replacement which arrived 12 days later a long delay
The replacement cupboard is ok although I am disappointed that the 2 doors are not symmetrical
I shall be seeking appropriate compensation
Hallowood Customer Services have been helpful throughout but the experience has been a disappointing one having researched our purchase very carefully
The damage to the box was considerable so some questions to the courier company might help to prevent further disappointment
Thank you
I ordered an expensive orchid arrangement The arrangement that I ordered was a cheaper version that didnt look like the photo although I paid the top versions price
I have a full time job steady pay and everything they require and they didnt even let me get to the second step Looking like they are just taking your personal information and then thats it Dont do it Went some where else no issues
BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY i ordered a dress for my senior prom It came in and as soon as i tried it on the beads on it were falling off all over the floor AND its so see through Hate it
After three days of use the purchased device showed a visible defect leading to visible degradation I sent several emails to costumer support and Im still waiting for a reply
Order number VP069607
Im still waiting for customer support to reply to my emails and find a solution to my problem
Called to reserve a unit Agent very pleasant and well informed Received a follow up call from the facility Again excellent service
Comprehensive insurance system is complex
The reminders to add more items for free shipping is extremely annoying As is the socalled limited time offers that supposedly expire in an houreven though they are clearly going on all month Lets not forget the RIDICULOUS charge for a membership Stupid Just sell your clothes at a reasonable price like the 50 off members get and you will sell more of it without having to force people into purchasing a membership that they will nodoubt cancel every time just as I do Thanks for the cute work out clothes but you can shove your membership up my rear
Hoge transactiekosten
I bought a 100 dollar iTunes card and when topping up  the balance was only 50 dollars
I am currently staying in Maryland and wanted to order using my Australian travel card loaded with US dollars Goods to be delivered to Maryland address I could not enter my billing address as it is in Australia Although you list a help number to call you are not taking calls and refer customers to an online help service but that is not working either Very unsatisfactory
There has always been a delay getting products from biovea but i have accepted that and always ordered at least two weeks before i want the product
On this occasion i ordered on 8th January and paid immediately
I received an email sating delivery expected between 25th January 29th January 2017 When the email didnt arrive i emailed them on 27th January to see where the product was I was told to wait for delivery it was on its way Still no parcel so i emailed on 0302 was told to give it a bit longer I emailed again on 0702 to be told to wait 
Today i called the customer service department and the lady told me it was in the post office when i told her this was not the case because i have never received a note from the post office to say it was there she admitted it probably got lost somewhere I told her the order was now urgent and the service was appalling she said nothing she could do but give me my money back She was really rude so i spoke to manager he admitted they had changed warehouses and no tracking numbers were on parcels He admitted it was an error but could not send product out urgently it would take another week and half to two weeks
To say i am appalled with service and lack of care about my valid complaint is an understatement i will no longer using the products in the future because i cant trust they will arrive
My advise DONT part with your money You are tied into a contract which is small print I joined for one month and found the site useless you dont even know how far away possible dates are other than somewhere in the UK I parted with a months subscription only to be rebilled without permission or consent for a further 3 months  10 admin fee 11400 and an intimidating email threatening me with a collection service  more costs There is not a simple option to cancel you have to send a form to a suite in Luxembourg to stop auto renewal This should never be allowed it is a total rip off There is not an option for zero stars otherwise they would get nil stars Avoid there are far better sites amongst the scam
Terrible service and technical issues have meant that I cant access my account or money I have in it I have made contact several times and still I have no access Dont waste your time
We were going to rent two cars from any rental company in Barcelona airportAfter intensive research I have found all companys AND I MEAN ALLjust type in any car rental firm on trustpilot you will be amazed have really horrendous reviews like people returning home to be shocked with a hefty bill for something they didnt doFuel extortionpeople getting high pressure from sales peopletake our insurance or you have to leave a massive deposit which we cant afford as all the holiday money would be spent on stupid charges from the hire companyFor me to hire two cars it would run up to nearly 700 plus to hire not including petrol charges and the massive deposit So I will not be hiring a car as I like to relax on holiday not to be bullied from sales staff from the get goI cant believe this is actually happening this day and ageSomething obviously needs to be put in place by the governmentsHonestly these companys will eventually have no choice but to treat us fairly once such laws are in placeSo for now airport transfers by taxi or bus is the way forwardRent a car by all means and get stressed to the max while your on HOLIDAY
Purchased high dollar amount of merchandise in three separate orders they have a 90 day satisfaction guaranteed hassle free return policy no limits no discretion implied I decided I wasnt happy with a great some of it did the online form printed labels shipped it back Never got credit or Merchandise returned when i inquire they said we are sorry you have exceeded you return rate limit and your account has been suspended no further returns or refunds can be made They refuse to return calls or emails right now this past point of bad business this is theft Ive not only contacted the BBB but the St Louis Police dept as well its well over 1000 dollars Of my money and merchandise
If they have a return rate limit
1 it needs to be implied in their policy that they reserve the right to limit Implying a limit would hamper sales
2 They make good on the business and their return policy they have done with the customer and stop doing business with them going forward if they deem them as a problem They dont get to do it midstream without returning merchandise or refunding money Very bad business
My son ordered flowers for delivery to his girlfriend He lives in Dublin and she is currently in Cape Town He received an email confirming they would be delivered on 14th Feb by 2pm It is now 16th and the flowers have still not arrived He is so disappointed especially as he ordered on the 10th Feb which was plenty of time The company dont have phone numbers for customers just this ridiculous Helpcentre which didnt work when we tried to submit a complaint and request a refundI am now waiting on an email
Upset that my furniture got ruined They got all damaged with water and the manager and employees were really rude I wasnt going to lose my things because they were expensive to lose
You wont respond to my questions by email or help to solve my problems with the booking
I just became a VIP member and increased the amount I spent so I could get 35 off and I didnt receive it It said it should automatically come off at the checkout and it did not I am very disappointed
So I joined Fabletics in 2015 as Id saw an ad online about cheap prices For one the prices arent even that cheap compared to other retailers including with the discount For another the price cannot be justified as the quality is appalling The first time I worked out the thread on the seams of the leggings started to fall apart This was the first strike against the company
The second strike was that I cant cancel my account I cant email I have to phone them which costs money As far as I know making a customer pay to cancel an account is an illegal act Strike 2
I was asked to send a letter to them to cancel my account instead which I did I didnt get an email on the 1st of Feb telling me that I needed to skip this month and thus I thought yay finally my account was cancelled Today on the 10th I was charged 44 Not only was I not forewarned this month as for the past year I have in fact skipped the month the not pay the costs I was also charged 4 days after Fabletics states in their terms and conditions that they require the payment This is an appalling way to get money off customers especially since I had done what they asked me to cancel my account
I have emailed them now and brought it up with Paypal that this charge was unauthorised I am surprised the illegal actions such as not having an easily accessible cancellation service has not been brought up in a court
Will not shop with them again or their sister company JustFab Will also do all I can to get refunded and get my account cancelled asap They are a disgrace
Booked a flight for March somehow got the wrong month sent to me on the Conformation was no was to get it changed to the date I booked originally without paying 250
BOUGHT A REFRIGERATOR AT THE STORE WAS TO BE DELIVERED TODAY WAS NOT DELIVERED TODAY AND I WAS TOLD IT WILL BE ANOUGHTER TWO WEEKS I CALLED THE STORE AND TOLD THEM MY PROBLEM AND I WAS PLACED ON HOLD AND AFTER TEN MINUETES I JUST HUNG UP THEY ARE VERY EXCITED TO SELL YOU STUFF BUT AFTER THE SALES SERVICE IS TERRIBLE
The company offers online products and not have them in stock I paid and now have to wait for my money No information for now
Disappointed
Had to place my order 7 times because of bugs in your website that would keep giving me an error message each time i wanted to check out
Flowers in offer on the homepage and in reality its a shame
As an avid online consumer I have made hundreds if not thousands of online purchases No exchange or purchase can compare with my dealings with 4seatingcom It has been the worst consumer experience I have ever had to endure If I said they had proven incompetent I would be giving them credit they dont deserve
I ordered my chairs December 19th The order was to ship December 22nd I was given the impression I would receive them the first week of the new year I waited until the second week to inquire about them they showed delivered to the white glove service but no one had contacted me When I checked with 4seating they tried to determine what was going on they gave me the number to the white glove service and I contacted them directly They said they couldnt schedule the delivery until the order was complete all parts delivered to them Apparently they only received two of the eight chairs I had ordered After perhaps a dozen phone calls it was determined our lost chairs had shipped to Pompano Beach Florida According to 4seating it seemed the shipper  who made the error did not feel compelled to rectify their mistake by rushing to get the lost chairs to us 4seating compensated us for the inconvenience by putting 200 back on our credit card They also shipped out complimentary holders for our chairs because they felt so bad Unfortunately 4 seating shipped those to the wrong address Those have still not been delivered The chairs finally arrived and were white glove deliver today January 28th 2017 My wife and I joked the order couldnt be fowled up any worse but to our chagrin it was One of the chairs was missing the electric recliner motor I called 4 seating and was on hold 27 minutes and 36 seconds before I was disconnected I called back and used the extension for purchases thinking that wait wouldnt be as long I spoke with Clarisa who informed me no manager or supervisor was available today they were off and that they would call me tomorrow They didnt call in fact no supervisor was on duty today
It should be noted I am a proactive consumer I am not sure how long this ordeal would have lasted had I not been making the effort to call them and follow up on our order I counted the emails and phone calls I have made thus far and it comes out to
25 emails
52 phone calls to 4Seatingcom and
15 to the local White glove delivery service
These are the ones I can find on my phone with their common numbers I am sure there are more to different extensions
The only redeeming thing I can say is Rebecca the assistant who tried to rectify this mess was abundantly apologetic sympathetic and genuinely seemed to care I dont know if she was hamstrung by corporate incompetence or that we happen to be the very unlucky consumer that have had everything go wrong
Update
I spoke with Fernando this afternoon Despite being told a manager would call it never happened there was no manager on duty today After speaking with Fernando i was able to assemble the chairs in the proper configuration thanks to his patient and understanding instructions In addition he was able to order a motor and have it shipped to my home He advised me to call him as soon as it arrives and he would dispatch a technician to install the motor The chairs seem nice but the consumer experience with the exception of Fernando and Rebecca was abysmal Sent from Yahoo Mail for iPad
After making the payment I received an email saying the price has increased and thus I would like to get a complete refund of my money back I have sent an email as well and not yet heard back
Has anyone else faced something similar
Your choice to charge sales tax which you can blame on the state which I realize is your duty makes me want to locate store that can ship without charging sales tax
Waiting for two weeks have not received is too slow
do NOT use this company I called to get a Quote and the guy extremely rude Worst customer service that I have ever seen towards a potential client
I called Smith they said 1795 using my equip then they changed it to 2495 during the install The final price is almost 4000 and it took them 12 days to get back to finish and that was after several calls Now the system is still beeping and I cant get them back
I will be notifying BBB and the FTC
They used this app Handshake LLC to charge me in order for the order to go to shipping Then when I got the package they charged me again the same price in order for me to pick up the package I emailed them but they have ignored my 4 emails now for over a week Im fairly sure this site is a scam
Lost my custom Took order and money and then messaged to ask for more money as they had mistakenly said free postage
I am a regular renter of Goldcar but this trip I failed to go over the car really carefully when I picked it up to mark any additional damage beyond what they indicated on the sheet they provide I know that I did not hit anything during my rental but upon the inspection they found a 20 cent coin sized scratch on the front air foil and charged me 200 euros for the repair I have my own insurance so I never take the insurance they offer as it is quite expensive and it seemed this was a bit of a punishment
As I was extending my trip I had to switch cars and create a new contract I then went over the new car meticulously with their accident sheet and found 8 small scratches and dings that were the size of the one I had been charged for beyond the ones that they had listed on their sheet They verified the notes and stamped it So be very careful Unless you take their expensive insurance double the daily price of the rental It is your responsibility to make sure that you record EVERY scratch even the smallest ones to be sure they dont charge you It seems that this might be another way for Goldcar to generate extra revenue
Book I bought was trash Stains all throughout it and multiple torn pages Yet somehow they charged more than other websites
The books were dirty torn and not repaired sent in filthy paper
Although hired the car through autoeuro web site Found after payment that the Rental company was actually Interrent but the actual company in Lanzarote who rented us the car was EUROPCAR 
At the desk the guy was busy and handed over the key and after signing the paper work There was a dent already marked on the document which was on the car  He told us where the car was on off we went Remember one is on holiday 
After the week I handed the car in at the airport car park at the Euro car booth the attendee there checked the car and said everything was fine I bought to his attention a pre existing dent already marked on the document when I took the car initially Flew out on New year eve
After about 12 days got email from Interrent with Invoice for 305 Euro for damage I raised a complain with Auto Euro and have had no response from AutoEuro for over 5 weeks They are waiting a response from the RENTAL CAR COMPANY
Spoke to the manager in their complains department and she basically implied it served me right for hiring a cheap car through cheap COMPINIESShould have used Hertz or Avis
I am honest not sure how this helps others as I thought this was about Energia My main complaint is your requirement to be paid every two months so that a large bill comes in and can be difficult to meet I much prefer the system my last provider had of a fixed sum paid monthly and occasionally adjusted to take account changes in use Far easier to manage your finances  household budget It is also irritating to have to be asked to read the meter just before the bill is produced People have got enough to do without having to do your job of reading the meter This was not the case with my last provider either
Stubborn people to deal with Much friendly and more professional providers out there Shop around is my advice
I put tickets to Green Mundine fight up for resale Part of the problem was my lack of experience with technology however repeated emails for assistance went unanswered The event had been and gone and I was still unaware whether the ticket resale had been successful After the event I received an email advising sale had been completed Just left me anxious for quite awhile I have since received payment
All my websites are down for last Seven Days They keep saying that they will recover the back in 34 Hours but no response till date
I have 8 Website associated with their hosting and all of them are down As a result we lost the contract with reputed real estate group
Shame on UnlimitedGB
Trying to redeem my ps4 plus with the code you guys gave me for a 3 month subscription and Playstation gives me a WC403760 Error which means a faulty code Extremely unsatisfied I need my money back or a code that works

I ordered from WalMartcom therefore Pharmapacks was a third party vendor I ordered Downy dryer sheets and apparently WalMart had the wrong price listed and I was told to contact the sellar which I did I waited on hold for over 17 minutes before my call was ever even taken The customer service rep was rude and had a cocky attitude They would not refund me my full amount although I did not receive all of the product that I ordered neither would they send me the rest of my order I am completely discussed by the service and product that I received I do not recommend buying from this company
Recieved a message from customer service about an issue with my order I do not have access to that number What happened
I placed an order since 24th november 2016 and till date today is Feb 8 2017 I have not received the product
Despite plenty of emails I only received a generic email Please wait 12 weeks it is on its way The customer service is suboptimal
In addition to losing faith in their customer service I am contemplating on contacting paypal as I am begining to think this company has a fraudulent transaction schemes where they take the money for the product and then frustrate the contract by pretending that it is lost in mail
If any one else has the same problem perhaps its time to consider contacting paypal together
Have had a number of bad experiences with DPD They usually fail to deliver on the specified day without any notification leaving you waiting around They reschedule delivery dates without any consultation Have seen many complaints against them yet they fail to rectify any issues
I will be avoiding DPD in future and would suggest you do to
delivered next day not in st valentin day
If you care for your stuff STAY AWAY
Worthless support will not get back to you or really help
Warehouse people are not reading instructions and dont care about your stuff
So really be smart and look somewhere else
Item did not arrive in said time NO communication provided regarding same from Zodee I then had to ASK for compensation of returning the express shipping I paid for Overall disappointing experience I would think twic about purchasing from this store again
Only one genuine contact One keen to assassinate the character of the rest of the industry One made assumptions from a satellite photo
They were the wrong flowers together with no card and no comments that I made to my granddaughter No one was at home at the time of delivery on the 4th of Feb so they had to picked up on the 6th when it was picked up they were wilted and and only lasted two days I know for the price I paid they should of lasted at least 2 weeks with good care even longer maybe It is so sad that my granddaughter never got to read my comments to her for her birthdayVery Very Very SadOh I almost forgot to mention that the vase was plastic and too big for the bouquet I would of paid more for a glass vase

Phoned the 1800 number and given all kinds of excuses weather in Ontario other shipments held up because of weather  what that has to do with my order that is sitting in Winnipeg Supposed to be nice here again tomorrow probably delayed again because of weather Stay away use somebody else
I order nice flowers but u send very old one and different colour that I choose u made me ashamed in front of my fianc
This experience has been terrible They had to change our booking multiple times then they had the name wrong on it I had them fix it and I finally think everything is okay But when I checked AirCanadas website to look at the booking the code showed up as invalid Im still in the process of sorting things out but I can promise I will NEVER use lookupfare again
UPDATE
Called the airline and the seats are booked However I am not at all pleased as lookupfare failed to send us a conformation email the new reference number or itinerary
I ordered a replacement mouthpiece for my G Pro and it doesnt even fit onto my vape It obviously a fake And I ordered a grinder it was tiny I didnt even get to pick the color of it The shipping and all that was fine but Im really upset about the mouthpiece I will not be buying from the website ever again
I purchased a Blackphone2 only to find out its counterfeit so I went to PayPal to get a refund I have to pay the postage to send it back with tracking number if I am to get anything at all The postage will cost 14 cost of phone This company is a con Dont buy from them Very untrustworthy
I did an order and it never arrived
The credits make you feel like you are locked in Rather than you are apart of some kind of membership The quality of some of the clothes are a toss up The sports bras are beautiful but the shirts are the luck of the draw as far as quality I regret signing up I just want to use my credits and get out
My husband did not received his card supposedly posted 9 days ago ordered 10 days ago Will not use this service again 
I ordered dance shoes and they are unusable because the quality is so poor Ive emailed them but no reply How can I get a refund
They sold me the watch then refunded the monies and said the watch was misprint in price
We purchased 7 Ebikes from Shenzhen Shenhai Mechanical and Electrical with good warranties As soon as the 1st warranty claim was submitted they fell off the radar I submitted a complaint to Alibaba but all they said they would do was put a comment on the sellers mini site a slap on the wrist with a wet bus ticket As a minimum they should have barred them from trading on Alibaba However after discussions with my colleagues in New Zealand and overseas we have decided to severely restrict our trading through Alibaba until they sort out an amicable solution to this situation
Alibaba should not be seen to be supporting dodgy traders that do not honour their warranty periods on their own merchandise
Found that your prices are 3 plus time the price of other suppliers My fault for not checking soon enough PLUS your delivery is extremely slow Will refuse shipment and stop payment if not received by 2132017
Purchased a joir buggy less than on month ago for my 17 month old essential I have a good quality buggy as I do not drive and only way to get around
Stitching on a harness strap has come undone on the 3rd time of use 1 hour to speak with customer service asked to email photo which I did straight away however no acknowledgement or no reply within 24 hours Further 1 h phone call The reply was they need to inspect the item despite clearly seeing the photo Although they were not able to explain what they would be inspecting and what conditions were needed before a refund
Not only will I be without a buggy over 1 week before the refund is issued I asked for a curtsy buggy in the interim I was advised this was against policy the person I spoke to said it clearly explains this on the website However he was unable to find it and said later it was not on the website
I am awaiting collection and inspection although they are not able to say what an inspection will involve before issuing a refund
I have no trust in this company and would advise caution if you need to address a problem
The flower arrangement I ordered for my significant other in Japan was delivered TWO days late When it wasnt delivered on the 13th after 200 PM like their florist confirmed they would I sent them an email to which they never replied to On the 15th around noon Japan time the arrangement hadnt been delivered yet so I sent them an email requesting a refund to which of course they never replied to either Later that after noon  Japan time they delivered the arrangement
Also the card I added to the order was not a real Valentines card it looked more like half of a cardstock sheet where they printed the message and a bunch of flowers around it not worth the price I paid for it
I sent them a third and final email letting them know that I was dissatisfied with the poor customer service they provided me with Like I told them in it I understand that delays may happen especially when orders are placed for busy dates such as Valentines day I too understand that sometimes things may be out of their control since they also deal with 3rd party providers to service their customers but not replying to my first two emails addressing my inquiriesrequests is VERY unprofessional and what really bothered me They may say its a busy season because we receive a lot of orders for Valentines but that seriously doesnt cut it If you really want to provide an excellent experience work overtime hire temp workers do whatever you need to do to keep your customer happy and have the COURTESY to reply to their emails with their inquiries because after all youre not providing a service for free
I was going to start filing a refund through PayPal if I didnt hear from them but the items were delivered albeit late so I wont do it That said and like I told them in my last email this was the first and last time I do business with them
I order 15 packs of hair and only received 10 This is very disappointing and unacceptable
I was very specific what I needed from my insurance I was told which policy to buy I bought it It covered nothing When I called to ask about it no one could tell me who spoke to me or sold the plan When I called to cancel no one could help me or tell me the status of my application They answer the phone call right away when you need to purchase insurance and hand over your credit card information He met his qouta for how many policies he needed and I paid and received zero coverage Absolute waste of money I was better off without insurance
Please let people know if you dont have items in stock before they order
When I placed my order it said item will be shipped in 57 days
3 days later I was emailed and told the item was on back order and would be shipped in 23 weeks
After nearly a month and not having had any update I contacted them and was told it would be shipped in 3 days
2 days later was emailed and told there was anothe delay of 12 weeks
I cancelled the order and got a refund  which was done quickly and shopped else where
When you order the screen is relatively cheap but the shipping is super expensive When you try to return it they make the process complicated You even have to pay for shipping yourself
Item never received Wrong shipment method Customer service asked to wait a little more each time
I had a refund eventually after 2 months waiting many emails and personal time waster
If you pay through PayPal this site will redirect you to PayPal and prompt you to log in once you log in it just charges your account Processing fees without you confirming the order first These fees are hidden so beware of it
I received no help from your customer service department
I was not aware of an additional charge for selecting a seat I have never been charged for a economy seat I will not deal with FlightGub again and will spread the word to my friends and on facebook
You state on your website that you guarantee the lowest price but when I contacted customer service right after placing my order and let him know that it was cheaper on another website he said he could not price match I let him know that if he could not match the price that I was cancelling my order He did not cancel the order and the tracking number provided was not correct and never showed shipped I didnt know if the order was cancelled or not so I placed another order with the other website I emailed again to make sure the order was cancelled He said it had shipped and that it could not be cancelled He then provided another tracking number after the shipment arrived and said the shipment would need to be returned if I didnt want it If you do not guarantee the lowest price you should remove that from your website It is false advertising
I bought two mobile phones and one of them was not working properly It was switching on and off all the time
I wanted to return the phone and get a refund I could not get in touch with them After twenty emails they responded and following another 10 emails i finally was told where to send the phone I had to pay for posting the phone back and that costed me almost half of what the phone was worth 2 months have passed and after more than 50 emails i still have no confirmation whether they received the phone or not and whether i will be refunded I am still waiting
That was definitely a Bad  Unacceptable experience Regarding their customer service definitely unreasonable and rude conduct
I never received my order 170120001069556438
Tracking number dosens work 
I have No idea if i wil recive the things i payed for
The only fast thing about this Company  is to withdraw your creditcard

I wanted to buy film for an Instax camera on sale  cost of 12 Shipping would have been 18 I could FEDEX overnight for less than that USPS 3 day would have only been about 5 So now I have to drive all the way to pick it up  this is terrible customer service
Long lead time no clear estimation of the lead time No clear status update of the order it only mentions paid and no idea when they expect to be able to deliver
Delivery and order status information needs to be improved
Never got my flowers
I bought a personalised reg number and used the one shop for all option to ha my private number plate made
I ordered a plain number plate as I only wanted the Registration number printed on the plate
When the plate arrived it had also printed on it who had made the plate and their telephone number
So not plain When I questioned this i received an email to say this was a legal requirement
When I checked the government website I couldnt see where it said that it was a legal requirement for this company to advertise themselves on my business cars number plate
Ive asked them to show me where this detail is and two days later Ive had no response
I think someones nose is growing somewhere bunch of bull sh

ordered flowers for a funeral
the flowers never showed up
after complaining in several emails they wrote me back that they were sorry but send me a delivery note
the delivery note said nothing about the place it was delivered and it was delivered hours after the funeral

When I ordered my contacts the opticontacts website indicated that my lenses were in stock But once the order went through I received an email indicating that the lenses werent in stock and that they would take 10 business days to arrive Its now been almost four weeks since my order was placed and I still dont have any contact lenses I called opticontacts today and they indicated that it will be another 10 days until they ship my lenses The fact is that they could get the lenses from the manufacturer overnight if they were willing to pay a bit more to fix their mistake Instead they offered to give me free overnight shipping But that is no consolation given that the lenses are going to be at least five weeks late The website should be more honest about what is and isnt in stock I would have just ordered from someone else if I had known the wait was going to be this long This is truly a terrible company
Ordered a pair of shoes that were to be in stock on a specific date as listed in description Didnt stock them until a month and a half after advertised date Then I ordered sandals and after not getting an order confirmation email after it hit my PayPal as pending I called and they said there was a gliche in their system and I had to order them all over again and fight for the coupon code that was valid at the time only to get a total that ended up being more then the original PayPal amount I wont use them again I think they are too big of a company to make for a flawless buying experience and I honestly didnt feel like they cared about my issues
I purchased an android passkey unlock which kept failing Attempted multiple different methods but regardless of how I tried it would not work No response from support yet have escalated to paypal but not feeling positive based on the below
Product looks good and states my device is supported but just wouldnt work
I have requested to repack 3 packages but the parcel I have received is only consisted 2 out of 3 packages I have emailed and follow up for several times then only they replied by saying that they have confirmed with their repacking staff where they have consolidated 3 packages and shipped it
However in fact their repacking staff did not consolidate 1 of the packages It is evidenced by the detailed description of contents of shipping label which paste on the parcel It is clearly showed that there was only 2 items they have sent As I have total 3 packages how come there was only 2 items
In addition the billable weight of the parcel I received is only 1 lbs while the net weight of the items in all of my 3 packages has already exceeds 1 lbs and this has not including the packaging weight How could the billable weight is only 1 lbs if the net weight of my 3 packages items has already more than 1 lbs
Apart from this the size of the parcel I have received was only 15cm x 115cm x 125 cm It is so obvious that this small size couldnt accommodate all my items
I have emailed several times to seek for their clarification but they never bother to respond I couldnt understand if this is a reputed company why dont they investigate and clarify Im truly upset and suspecting that this is their normal practice where the package missing without any reasonexplanation I guess I have lost my money and my package I would advise all BE CAREFUL AND PLEASE AVOID THIS COMPANY
UPDATE from usgobuy on Feb 16 2017 after provide them the picture of shipping label purchase invoice of missing item and tracking number of missing item as requested
We are sorry to tell you that your missing package 344759302078880 is not in our warehouse and our repacking staff confirmed we have consolidated all of your 3 packages and shipped to you
Since there is no insurance applied for USPS firstclass packages We cannot file any claims to USPS or refund to you
In this case we would like to send you a 5 coupon you can apply it for your next parcel when payment amount is over 50 We are sorry for any inconvenience this may caused to you
Im truly upset with this kind of official explanation without proper explanation on my doubts on the shipping label weight and size of the parcel that I have received Well if their repacking staff has really consolidated and shipped how come 1 of my packages item is not listed in shipping label The parcelboxs size and weight that I have received all proved that 1 of my packages has not consolidated and shipped
My first and ever experience with usgobuy is totally a disaster and if anyone read this please choose other fowarder services
UPDATE from usgobuy on Feb 18 2017
We have checked the information on your shipping label of parcel LZ106815735US I think its a strong evidence Based on this information I will check with our warehouse once again why there is incomplete information on the label and if it has something to do that we forget to consolidate the parcel
We will get back to you within 12 business days
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation
Dreadful service and customer service since day one
Flowers were not delivered
Im not satisfied with your servise beacuse
1 There was no information that you are using bookingcom white label affiliate and you will gonna use my bookingcom account to store booking information there And when I was filling up form there was no any connection to bookingcom just simple standard form So I was confused when I received confirmation email with bookingcom logo
2 When I book on bookingcom there always cancelation options are highlighted and explained On you website there is a grey label NO REFUND aside another grey label PAY LATER which is confusing I had to please bookingcom to cancel my booking without payment for cancelation That was uncomfortably
You may save a bit of money by completing the class but the experience will leave you with such an insulted feeling it may not be worth
Out of date information poorly presented with no apparent updates for changes in statistics and technology
I thought had a good experience with FlightNetwork the prices are very good and cheapest I could find anywhere UNFORTUNATELY when I checked by credit card bill I was charged 2490 canadian dollars per person Why were there hidden charges When I was booking it never mentioned of the additional charges I am so disappointed Avoid Flight Network
I accepted a task and AirTasker deleted it because the task didnt comply with AT community guidelines However as someone who was completing the task  finished it I wasnt notified it was deleted Only when I went back onto AT to post the task did I notice it had been deleted It really was a waste of my time  effort since Im not getting paid for it
Left note to leave parcel with neighbour if not in Courier ignored note and left parcel with post office 1 mile away without leaving card through letter box on Tues Dont usually check tracking but as needed racket for match on Fri found out that courier tried to deliver
Emailed customer service and parcel force on Wed  nobody bothered to reply
Rang customer service on Thu  collect it yourself if you want it for the match can arrange redelivery but wont get there till Monday
Am living on a state pension not only do I have to pay for the call I had to pay travelling expenses to collect the racket not to mention the hassle and inconvenience
Will not shop with Tennis Nuts again
I was told by SJF that all tear drop pallet racking would fit with other tear drop and that was not the case I had to grind down the connectors on the rail to fit into the existing tear drop uprights that I had Also the uprights were bent I should have done a better job of inspecting and checking and not just taking SJF word for it
I asked Interflora to deliver the flower on the afternoon and the delivered them early in the morning So she wasnt at home and they delivered them to her mother 
The promised shipping date for my order was delayed several times without any notification I agreed to pay for overnight shipping for which I was given a discount after learning of a delay when I contacted customer service But only half of my order was able to be shipped when promised When the second half of my order was ready to be shipped which was delayed by more than two weeks without any notification they refused to ship overnight saying it is against the companys policy to do anything that would cause them to lose money on an order
I am dissatisfied
With the product
never again
bye bye
I have just had the worst day Three days ago I booked 3 tickets for a London show with last minute All booked but the operator I booked it with on the phone said his system was down and couldnt give me a reference no But it was booked He would emailit over
The next day the email hadnt arrived
I phoned and waited for ever for an answer
The next day my girls and I excited bought our train tickets ando looked forward to the show
On the train and still with no email I phoned them again 15 minutes it took for the girl on the phone to tell me she has found my booking and would be emailing me conformation
Guess what the email never arrived
So at the theatre after spending nearly 100 to get there and the box office tell me there are no tickets reserved for me
I phone lastminute again and after 10 minutes get through to someone who was hopeless I demand to speak to a manager At this point my children are getting upset We now have 5 minutes until the show starts The manager comes to the phone who just tells me that he will investigate and he will come back to me in 72 hours  I asked him 5 times to confirm if all thier calls are recorded He did not want to answer and this from a manager
I have demanded a transcript of the 3 calls I made Will I get them based on the above I doubt it I will however be taking this to solicitors
Finally after the upset the theatre manager who witnessed the unfolding event looked and fortunately had 3 tickets available at a cost of nearly 3 times the price I had originally booked
I dont have bundles of money but couldnt bear to see the upset on my girls faces
I am absolutely discussed with this appalling customer service The manager I spoke to should be sacked and the girl who confirmed she had found my booking also needs some sort of training
What was set and planned to be a special treat for myself and my girls turned out to be a very expensive and stressful time
Disgusting
Ordered flowers on 14 feb its 15 feb and half day is gone still not delivered
Non mi  piaciuto
Booked a holiday to stay in the Lotte New York Palace for 4 nights the lastminutecom website only let me book for 2 adults and 2 children despite I have 3 children Didnt worry too much as my youngest has only just turned 2 and likes to sleep in a big bed with her sisters the room we booked was 2 x queen size beds so thought no problem Phoned lastminutecom to ask them to add my 2 year old to the booking they said ok and theyd email the hotel to request it In my mind I thought worse thing is they may charge a little more which of course is no problem Couple of days later I then get an email from them stating my request to amend my booking has been declined and so my booking remains the same I immediately called them to be told that they had tried to contact the hotel to no avail and so the request to amend my booking couldnt be granted Aparantly I was supposed to travel with 2 of my daughters and leave my third behind They then told me they would try again in 3 days to contact the hotel and then would get back to me I asked why in 3 days time why not several times a day I was put on hold and then when the lady came back I was told they will be in touch with me by 72 hours another way of telling me 3 days and so I still have no idea if I can stay at the hotel or not yet theyre telling me I cant cancel either We fly out on 29th March I can honestly not get my head around the mentality of this company I got very stressed in the end and so said its fine I will wait and then I hung up Ive now emailed the hotel directly in the hope of getting some sense from them I honestly wouldnt be bothered if my request was something like can you please add breakfast to my booking or can we get an early check in but we are talking about turning up in New York with the possibility of been turned away from the hotel because they wont let my 2yr old daughter stay The lady on the phone quite frankly didnt seem at all bothered
cant get anyone to help wont be renewing
Purolator was used to deliver my Amazon package However citing bad weather they failed to deliver two days in a row The weather is completely fine if not a little cold Their customer service which is to say DELIVERING PACKAGES is hideously subpar If I had any choice I would never ever use Purolator This company is a disgrace Utterly indescribably crap
Cancelling reservation Will not use again
My prescription is expired I need a refund My Dr Said it was illegal to fill the prescription
I live in Canada and shipping is expensive So I placed a bulk order to save on shipping cost However an item was missing upon receiving the package
I emailed support immediately and their response was to refund me as it didnt make sense for them to reship
Firstly their refund did not include the delivery cost that Ive already paid based on shipment weight
Secondly by asking the customer to reorder the missing item and pay for another shipping fee isnt fair This should be a cost covered by the company for running a retail business and not at the expense of the customer
This company dont care and backup their name when things go south Maybe they will if youre local
My book was overpriced there was a 300 sticker on it and the original retail price was 1495 but I paid 18 The worst part is that the book has an overwhelming mildew smell
Waited 2 weeks and still no winnings in my bank account they said it takes 5 working days absolute scam
ok 1 star for selling on the site very easy to use 1 star for being able to drop off my stuff at a local shop very convenient however thats were it stops My payment was processed on the 9thJanuary today is the 17th and I am still waiting I have wrote emails to we buy books regarding a couple of things including wheres my payment and its a normal polite reply but still no payment not sure whether I would use them again or even if I would recommend them as this has been a poor experience
Ordered card on Friday for delivery on Tuesday Valentines day with standard first class based on advised expected delivery on Tuesday arrived on Thursday Not Happy
132 order never received and you could sit on hold with customer service for days and no one would answer
They dont unlock your phone within the allotted few days and I had to get it unlocked by a faster method inperson here in Toronto Canada They refused a refund and now Im going through Paypals dispute process
Horrible Customer Service
Ive never received the packaged ordered hair over a week ago The system failed to give me consistent updates of where where my package is located
Do not use FloraQueen for any flower gifts for delivery to Denmark FloraQueen doesnt work with any Danish florist so the flowers are shipped with postal service from Germany The quality of the flowers are terrible the bouquets are ugly and the delivery service through the Danish Post Post Nord is useless It takes 56 days and the receiver me it was a birthday gift ordered from New Zealand must pick up the gift at the post office themselves
I have just read the reply from FloraQueen and it simply isnt true what you say I was in fact home on the day of the delivery but by using the Danish Postal service that only has certain delivery days  and not a courrier  the bouquet was not even delivered on the required day If you work with Danish florist it seems very odd that the flowers were sent from Germany On top I didnt even write in my review that this delivery was a second delivery as an apology from you after a complaint since the first order was supposed to arrive on my birthday in January This wasnt delivered but had to be picked up at the post office as well as it was the wrong bouquet and not the one ordered by my partner Not good enough FloraQueen You should refund the money as an apology
I didnt feel that the communcation was great after the order was placed The trucking company delivered part of the order and the remainder was Lost It took multiple emails by me to try and figure out where the final item was to complete my order and never did receive a definitive answer as to when it would deliver A few days later it just showed up
Once all items arrived the racking worked as expected
I used DHL as first time and my shipment returned to them from the customs and I have sent and informed them about the shipment
They replied to me this
Dear Customer
The reason you are receiving this Email is because your packaged was returned back to our warehouse
Reason of that being is because the items are restricted to enter the country

Once we have done so youll be able to see it in your USGOBUY account

Since then the package didnt retune to their warehouse and they wont answer the calls or the emails
And they always delay the shipments because the storms as their considerations
You will regret register on their website even if its free

I ordered flowers for my girlfriend to her work on valentines day I paid a extra 1500 to make sure they were delivered before 1100AM I was supposed to get a text confirmation telling me they were delivered 330 comes around and my girlfriend left work without flowers I look on the website to check order status and it still says out for delivery I paid over 12000 for these flowers and they werent even delivered on within the window or even the day I paid for them I ended up stopping at the store and picking up flowers on my way home so I wasnt empty handed on valentines day I tried calling customer service 3 times now each time I am on hold for over 30 minutes and give up because I have better things to do than sit on hold
The website now says that the flowers are out for delivery today the day after valentines day which is not what I ordered the whole point of getting flowers delivered for valentines day is that they are delivered on valentines day
Either way I am very unhappy with this service and have already put in a dispute with my credit card company for a full refund I did a little searching on the internet and it looks like there are a ton of other people that have had similar problems I will noht be doing business with them again
I bought tickets that were almost double the original price believing they were the only tickets still available Only to find on the night that tickets were still available at the original sales price at the gate to the venue We feel we were taken advantage of
Price Quote unclear with not enough  information regarding taxesfees and insurance costs  looks like reasonable cost be unknows drove me away
Ordered on a Wednesday night to get it on Friday it came the Saturday When filling out my delivery address I clearly typed where I lived including the eir code Which is unique to my address Waited all day Friday to then receive a text from the delivery company that my parcel was sent to the country depot When I called customer service no apology offered told Id have to wait until the Saturday Very bad CC You shouldnt offer a next day delivery service then not do it 
My son wanted a pair of trainers for his 14th birthdayI ordered them no problem at all This was on a Wednesday I was so happy and thought I was sorted On the Monday 5 days after ordering I received a phone call saying the website wasnt up to date and the item Id ordered and paid for wasnt actually available
I ordered two different pairs of work out pants and they are the worst pants I have ever worn They keep falling down They fit nicely if you are just standing around but try to move in them and they just ride down SO ANNOYING I had to stop 50 times on my run to hike them up higher and higher and Free 710 day shipping Why when you can get free 2 day shipping
the part came in and was broken We were not happy and we are still waiting for the new part
We ordered a bath chair commode for my bedridden mother on Wednesday 1228 We were assured they would rush the request to the warehouse and it would be shipped via FedEx on thursday maybe friday at the latest We were told we could expect it in 5 business days Thursday 15 at the latest There is no warehouse owned by CareProducts they order from wholesalers and did not know their wholesaler was closed over the holidays It now looks like the chair will not be delivered until 117 In the meantime my bedridden mother must have bedbaths rather than a shower and use a bedpan Our bad situation continues When I called them they were nice they gave me a 5 discount but it does not cover the discomfort and unhappiness I just wish they had been honest
On December 29 I ordered by phone the Reflect Mini BT Bluetooth Sports InEar Headphones
I was told that it would be 5010 I specifically told the guy I wanted these cordless Bluetooth headphones as I use them in my business  I have to be able to walk around while on the phone
He shipped me the wired JBL Reflect Mini InEar Headphones with InLine Mic instead  which I cant use
After I received them I looked online  trying to make sense of what theyd done  found this ad which I screencaptured  which I cant seem to post here
I found an ad for the wired headphones they erroneously sent  they were on sale for only 3955 So even though I didnt want these if I had wanted them  they were hosing me on the price at 5010
Nonetheless they sent me the wrong ones so I called  the guy who after much discussion and weaselly attempts to the contrary said hed give me a Return Authorization for a full refund  email me a label I also did a screenshot of it  the Labels tracking info which I couldnt copy here
I sent the product back promptly  on 1517
By the way I went over to my local FedEx location and spoke with a guy there who I always deal with He told me that FedEx picked up the package at the post office where I dropped it and delivered it to another post office in PA They have no way to track it beyond their dropoff I believe Ive done everything I could have in this case to comply with World Wide Stereos RMA requirements cant get back my money from these people They conveniently keep saying they havent received my returned product back yet Since they sent the label to me how is that my fault
Next stop Better Business Bureau Social Media then Amazon

I order a hoodie in navy with grey hoodie and red zipperI got a navy with navy hoodie green zipperand the gloves I ordered from my other account broken I sent an email to check if I can get what I ordered and as been 3 days and no answer So far no good if they change me that horrible hoodie for the one will change my rating
Right Ive been a PP customer for 4 years and in that time lost well over 100k  Im what they would call a good customer or what you would calla mug
Anyhow something very strange happened Sunday night just gone and it has lead to my coming to the conclusion I will never use PP again
Lots people write posts on here about losing moneyits not fair boohoo In short its your choice no one elses what happened to me however defies belief
Sunday I logged in on my phone and noticed that 50 had disappeared from my balance upon looking at my account history it showed as being transferrednothing else
Obviously I instantly called Customer service and raised the issue and was told that it had been transferred to the Poker sectionstrange as I never play poker and was actually laying MArio Kart on the Wii when this supposed transfer and gameplay took place
Now the cynics will think that I just lost 50 playing poker and Im a sore loser I lost 3000 online last week with PP Im not about to try and falsely claim 50 trust me
Anyhow I get sent a form and fill it out and return it it says a 48 hours turnaround
Fast forward 4 days and still nothing account still frozen money still missing no update other than Its with our security team
The weirdest thing of all no one knows my PP login information apart from me I only ever play on my Mac or iPhone my phone was in my pocket and my mac was locked in my empty house and Ive checked the history just in case of remote login and its clean
Whomever accessed my account did the transfer at 1916pm and then waited 45 minutes to start playing and then played for 20 mins before stopping and leaving a balance of 18USD
Even if they had won the money would have been credited back to my bank card or been withdrawn by my PP CashPlus card both of which were in my wallet
There was a balance of 400so why they only transferred 50 is again very strange
The conclusion is that PP have not stuck to their turnaround times and are offering terrible customer service I will be going elsewhere from now on
Review of mail forwarding company Shipito Seriously the absolute worst customer service of any company Ive ever had the displeasure of having to work with After they destroyed several of my packages last time I used them I vowed never to use them again However a few months later I again wanted something from the US so decided to give them another try Bought the item and had it shipped to my US address with Shipito However when I tried to login I was unable to do so Contacted customer service Was told someone would look into it and get back to me Weeks later and still waiting for a reply I simply cannot for the life of me understand why this company spends time and money trying to attract new customers whilst at the same time trying so hard to drive their existing customers away Absolutely Unbelievable Avoid this company like the plague
I would stay well away from this company they take the money then nothing happens My order never arrived you email them get no reply i tracked down a phone number to call them direct and it was a 350 a minute premium number i am glad i payed through pay pal as they soon get your payment back UPDATED REPLY TO THERE RESPONSE Same old company dribble no matter what they write on these complaints the facts are you took the money and the product never arrived on valentines day so any late delivery is a waste of time
rubbish service dildo wasnt big enough for me lol
After canceling my account 5 months ago over the phone today I found a charge on my cc from fabletics This is a card that has automatic monthly payments and since I had already CANCELED my account with fabletics I was under the impression that I would no longer be charged The rep I spoke with was only able to refund 4 out of the 5 charges leaving me with a 49 balance to use I do not care to purchase more from this company and now I have to call back to actually cancel because he said that if we canceled at the time of the refund it could complicate the process
I was not happy with the item I sent it back and never heard back or got my money back its been almost 1 month already
3 weeks later no contacts I was told it was a supplier issue
They create fake ads in order to attract more customers
Poor customer service it took them 4 days to reply to every email
After that torture they didnt want to return my 100 because it was 10 days after I paid And they have 7 days return policy
So I wasted 100
Do not repeat my mistake 
I ordered a duvet cover I then cancelled the order because it would take too long to get I was told via email that my paypal would be credited within a day or two A week later still no refund I messaged them and they said it had been credited to my account and I had to select withdraw in my account I tried to do that and there was no withdraw button Then it told me my email was not recognized in there system After about 20 minutes of navigating through their site I saw where I could submit a complaint to the supervisor I tried about 10 times and it kept telling me it cant submit the review Ive never seen such complicated customer service in my life Now Im just frustrated and angry
I like my money back
If I were to pursue this experience all over again I definitely would not use Quicken Loan After speaking with the initial sales associate or whatever his title would be I was sent a written extimate In that estimate Closing were shown approximately six thousand dollars Once I committed to going with Quicken writing the initial check to cover the appraisal the next paperwork I received now had my Closing Costs at nearly twelve thousand dollars double what the initial estimate was Based on the amount of time market conditions and effort already put in I chose to stick with Quicken a decision I regret based on the EXCESSIVE CLOSING COSTS Im absolutely NOT recommending Quicken to anyone I know

I have reported Dresslily to the California BBB I ordered Mermaid blankets for Christmas Presents and was assured they would arrive by Christmas They were not I asked for a refund but they went ahead and mailed 2 of the blankets I now have no use for They credited 2000 to my account and promised to refund 2999 for the other two mermaid blankets which they still havent done Now it says those two have been mailed as well They customer service lies does not respond and even stopped responding to the BBB If encourage anyone that has had a bad experience to contact the California BBB I am still hopeful Dress Lily will uphold their promise to refund my money for blankets I dont even have any use for anymore
I am deeply troubled that CC has been very negative about our policy We suffered from a very bad hail storm that caused damage to our roof downspouts skylite window trim etc An adjuster was sent and we were referred to a case worker for repairs She was unavailable most of the time Messages were left and not returned for several weeks Our contractor communicated with her trying to resolve the claim he too had trouble with communication The house was repaired and later that year I received a letter saying that our coverage was in question and that we could be cancelled Twenty months later 02172017 I receive another letter saying that CC has concerns about the claim and that I should take appropriate measures to prevent additional losses Im not sure what I can do to prevent hail storms
this website does not want to work I had to switch from my phone to my laptop because it would not work
billing and meter reading requests are aloe a bad joke
The product was a bottle of shampoo It arrived in a box approximately one meter by one meter filled with styrofoam I am very disappointed in this companies stance towards corporate responsibility and environmental awareness I will not purchase from here again so long as the packaging continues like this
Please advise where I can dispose of such packaging
I ordered an item November the 30th and on February the 2nd this item was not yet delivered
Im abroad since this date so I dont know if it has been delivered
Called twice now Left 3phone messages for Rich to call Just sad Did not get my purchase Just support your customers with finding there shipments and orders You suck
You sent the used clothes to me
I had to wash twice because of the grim smell of perfume
Youre the worst
Although I was using the linen sheets alone without another set in rotation they shredded in less than a year and a half Ive paid 40 for Target sheets that lasted longer than that Dont waste your money
Ordered some skylight blinds for dakstra windows blinds2go claim they make perfectly fitting blinds for the various dakstra window sizes In my case when they arrived the side channels were too long
Called up customer services and was told to force them in and that they are supposed to be tight This damaged the window frame
Spent a good chunk of the afternoon on the phone to their customer services Eventually after sending in photos I was told by a really rude guy called Alex that there wasnt a problem that he could see the damage being caused to my windows but otherwise it looks fine and I should just keep forcing the side channels in
At this stage I made a complaint and asked to be called back by a manager with Alex telling me im wasting my time and his supervisor will just tell me the same thing
At the end of the day the manager calls back and told me that from the photos it looks like im fitting them correctly and he doesnt know why they are too long or too tight His advice was to either force them in file them down or send them back I needed the blinds for that day so then spent the evening filing them down and getting them to fit myself
End result im left with one damaged skylight wasted my afternoon calling their customer services and a good hour in the evening filing down the side channels so they fit correctly For all of that time wasted and the damage caused to my window they offered me back my 795 delivery fee
I would avoid this company for skylight blinds If youre unlucky and they dont fit dont expect any help from their customer services  and certainly dont listen to their advice if they ask you to force anything in if this damages your windows youre on your own
In my address package you out in someone elses order and order form
in this day and age that is simply ridiculous
horrible advertising on page
contradictions of region free vs not being region free
Rude staff I will never buy anything from seller that use UPS again
This is unethical MY wife called 2 days ago and was Quote d AAA and MIlitary Rates You are charging 200 MORE TOTAL than the previously Quote d MIlitary price
Returns policy is a joke from Ireland to Germany to France
And sending out wrong parts
Our HP computer  PAVILLION EITE is unable to install HP printer c 4795 Troubleshooter says it does not have a driver for this application We recently bought a new router NETGEAR AC1750 and NETGEAR moden
Thats why youre getting one star
Sales people were good as were the installers but the furniture got damaged during shipping and has not yet been replaced had it for 3 weeks now
Quality Control in Packaging did not work up to an International Standard of OperationsISO My order had two missing remote controls for party lights and 4 remote control batteries for similar remote controls My several requests did not get any reply from customer service They are offering couple of US  to get good reviews It is not they way you get good reviews You need to do the good job to get them

My local wont lay me a price about a horse Extremely rude cashiers
no one bothered to contact us to tell us that the pproduct was not available
I can not access some of my important documents due to poor sync All of the files seems synced but you can not access them from iphone or Mac
Another problem is poor customer service Even though I am a paid customer who has a priority support it takes days to receive a response
I highly vote against using Dropbox
I was charge for extra insurance which I have NOT ordered
I was not asked about this I only got papers in Spanish which I do not speak When I pointed out the difference in amount the employee said it was a deposit and I would get it back I ordered the following insurance when I preordered Partial Damage Cover with excess CDW Third Party Liability Insurance  I paid with my SAS MasterCard which provide extra insurance with rental cars My reservation was on 12990  but I was charge 23485 
Respond to Goldcars answer
When you standing in Malaga airport and only get the papers on spanish and your employee then lies about ithe said the extra amount we paid was a deposid not insurance I will call it fraud
I havent signed anything in english about your super relax cover
As I told your employee we were covered by my credit card
I purchased 8 boxes of contacts I should have done better research your company was not the cheapest I spent over 400 I found them much cheaper at lenscom I called your company to inquire if you price match she initially said yes but when I told her how much they were she instantly said no She offered a 10 credit I could have saved almost 200 by going with lenscom going forward I will be purchasing my contacts elsewhere Your representative was rude I spent over 400 I can get better customer service somewhere else Because of this situation you have lost a loyal customer
Was enjoying muscle meals until portions were becoming smaller I decided to weigh a piece of steak which was supposed to be 200 grams It weighed just over 100 grams and was noticeably small Also noticed chipotlas getting unbelievably small
The sales person will have you there for minimum of 2 hours so you become tired and sign away your life agree to anything Cars are priced at at least double the bluebook value with over 20 percent interest If your car breaks down they will conveniently repair in shop and add the repair bill to your loan at the same interest rate My car had NO problems outside of routine maintenance until they started repairing my oxygen sensor and engine mounts They said the finance departmemt when I totaled my car that they would consider the loan satisfied if I financed another car Right before they sent me out in a second car that overheated under 120 miles I was informed that if I defaulted on the second loan Id be responsible for 2 car loans as my loan wasnt totally wiped out like the account rep promised This time is the first time I heard the word forbearance come out of their mouths A bunch of con and rip off artists is what Oak Motors is made of If you must purchase a car that you dont know the price of until signing the final paper work  take a mechanic with you and take it to AutoZone during test drive to put on diagnostic machine Single mothers beware Dont do it
I have a diagnosed connective tissue disorder and mentioned that I had tried everything for pain short of prayer It was a joke but then started questioning me about it I said I was atheist so it doesnt make sense for me and he started giving me a speech about how my thoughts are making me sick etc Totally inappropriate Also he seemed totally high and not focused on what I was saying
Not able to set up account because a phone has to be filled out but cannot select that field Support keeps referring me back to filling out the phone number 
I ordered my socks on 1232017 and still have not received them Very dissatisfied
Last year I didnt receive a new tax disc after paying for my renewal  when I complained I was rudely told that it had been sent to me and that it was not Boxymos responsibility to ensure that it is sent safely to me and that if I wanted a replacement it would cost me 30 euros to send another I had no choice but to pay the money out of my own pocket without any evidence that it had even been sent in the first place Also avoid this insurance company if you live in a rural area The GPS tracking that monitors your driving habits does not work properly in the country  I never had an issue when I lived in the city as the roads are notorious for wildly varying speed limits Therefore it is almost impossible to remain within the threshold and you just end up with a text every Friday telling you that youre a maniac and to drive carefully To top it off my policy was cancelled out of the blue 2 weeks before the renewal with no refund and the only explanation was that the Underwriters policy had changed and that they couldnt comment further I am squeaky clean with my drivers record so I couldnt understand why it was cancelled When I asked for more info I was told rudely again that it was not Boxymos policy to discuss matters with their Underwriters and that I still wasnt due any form of refund I then asked for my no claims bonus to be sent to me in the post  it was never received and ill hazard a guess that I will need to pay 30 euros for another phantom claims certificate Along with Vodafone this has to be the worst company I have ever had to deal with
I was just finding very confusing been email for 4 different people to complete my order

I was convinced I was making the right choice with going with their recommendation And now Ive been two days without power First Energy doesnt know what the hell theyre doing even though I have called them 6 times today I still dont have power
Bravofly acknowledged the tickets correctly to me but I later found out that they booked 1 month wrong at the airline This I did not know until I was going to take the flight So I had to buy new expensive tickets at the airport Now 4 months later I still havent recieved my money for the new ticket I had to buy I cant talk to anyone who can make a decision over the phone so I have to email customer service Their reaction time is always minimum 6 days Bravofly acknowledged that they made a mistake and that they will pay me but they just dont pay Nothing happens I cant recommend to use Bravofly
Ive booked and paied a flight to Virgin Australia through CheapOair The booking is confirmed by CheapOair This is an exact confirmation with an exact CheapOair boking Number and an exact airline confirmation number too I can not retreive my booking on the airlines website Virgin Australia neither by theier confirmation number nor by flight and travellers detailes It seems this booking has lost somewhere I can manage my booking on CheapOair website but neither here nor on theier confirmation it is not mentioned how many cabin and check in baggage are included or not included in the price Instead of an exact information they say that there are different policies on different flights and different ticket types so one must look it at the general rules of the airline The problem is that the confirmation does not show the type of the ticket and when I askt it from CheapOair they said a ticket type that was unknown by the airline
I just hope that at check in counter they will find my booking and I can carry the ususal baggages without any extra fee
All this would be much easier if I could manage my boking directly on the airlines website and CheapOair would show such important information on their confirmation like ticket type and what baggages included or not included in
I have booked air tickets from your website for me my wife and a 4 months old baby but only got denied boarding after waiting hours at the airport
Details you may find below
Booking number 865657699
Reason of boarding denial
1 airport cannot find our names in the passenger manifest
2 Shenzhen airlines counter informed us that our seats were cancelled on the same day after booking confirmed around midnight SGT
3 no available seats for upcoming flights therefore we cannot transfer
Inconvenience caused to us
1 we booked new tickets for the next day in a different city 170km away from Yangzhou airport
2 previous booked hotel in Shenzhen forfeited and booked new hotel in Nanjing
3 taxi fee from Yangzhou to Nanjing
4 carrying loads of luggage together with a four months baby waiting for hours and days in freezing weather full of frustration and exhaustion
I have contacted them numerous time and till now nothing heard from them
Fine I am gonna file a chargeback with my issuing bank
This company will use any opertunity to trick clients to pay expencive insurance when you pickup a car
Did not deliver on the right day
I definitely wouldnt shop with Interiors Online again I found the customer service to be poor and when I wanted to exchange my order I was told no I understand that it is part of their policy to do accept returns however I simply wanted to swap my order for a larger size even spending more money I was told it had to be returned exactly as it was delivered being the exact same box and all which I unfortunately did not have The person in which I was dealing with was very blunt and did not try to help us find a solution in the slightest
I WAS UNDERSTANDING AT FIRST BUT AFTER 4 PHONE CALLS AND 3 EMAILS  I HAVE HAD IT I DID NOT EVEN BUY A CARE FROM THESE IDIOTS BUT THEY KEEP CALLING AND CONGRATULATING ME ON MY PURCHASE I HAVE EXPLAINED AND EXPLAINED AND I AM STILL HOPING SOMEONE DOES SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SITUATION THIS IS REDICULOUS TO SAY THE LEAST WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE ARE RUNNING THIS COMPANY WOULDNT YOU THINK THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN EMBARRASSED ENOUGH TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS THE FIRST TIME THEY HAD KNOWLEDGE OF THIS MISTAKE HOW THE HELL DO YOU NOT KNOW WHO YOU SOLD A CAR TO I DO NOT EVEN LIVE IN THE SAME STATE DO NOT LET THESE PEOPLE GET YOUR INFO THIS COULD BE YOU WRITING THIS
When I made a return I lost 50 due to a restocking fee and paying for the shipping fee I didnt read this anywhere on the website so its very frustrating Never order off of this website unless you are POSITIVE you will like the dress and it will fit because the returns are a complete scam
I paid for vps and dont have acces
Ordered a book from Anybook Ltd only to get a email which I didnt see untill it was to late asking for 2 due to extra postage it was to late to pay and money was refunded So I re ordered the book which the price had gone up 2 which I expected due to postage however I then got the same e mail asking for another 2 postage so I cancelled the order and got the book from Amazon marketplace I wont use Anybook again
Trifty wanted to charge us insurance that was for a Lamborghini while we were driving a Jetta
We will not choose them again
I bought Elephone P9000 from coolicoolcom Within an year the phone frame started to bent which also causes the screen protrude away from frame Its clearly a build quality issue of the phone When contacted coolicool  they wanted me to pay for the repairing costreplacing screen They are purposefully avoiding to answer the main 2 problem 1 poor build quality causes the phone to bent 2 Manufacturing warranty so that I need to replace the phone They thing they act smart by avoiding from main issue Very poor customer service and they dont want to do anything after they sell the product to you simply wash their hands
Had to make bed as no sheets on and cat hairs on pillows
Due to fly from London to Lagos in April on an arik air flight booked through lastminutecom however Ive heard on the news the airline has gone bust and cancelled all international flights Ive rang customer services several times and keep getting false reassurance that the flight is confirmed Who do I believe I dont want to be turned away at the airport on the day
No shipping details provided not informed of shipping method or tracking
Finally located 4 weeks after payment through replying to their last email after buying same item from Officeworks which was delivered the very next day
No response to phone calls
Website possibly the most arcane and byzantine that I have ever encountered
Website continually would not recognise my email address as legitimate rendering it useless
A total experience never to be repeated advise others to be aware Ink Station and proceed only at their own risk
Called Edreams to verify information regarding flight and received the wrong information from representative After doing more research decided flight was what I needed booked it an noticed that I did not get to choose seats so I called back to customer service and was advised there was a charge just to have them select my seats after being on the call for 10 mins the representative told me I could select the seats myself by going through United airlines website so I did Then upon looking at my account I found that dreams charges 25 just for booking using there site Never againGo directly through the airlines directly the customer service reps here barley speak English and the communication skills are very poor
They say they are honest and all the good adjectives but what they dont say is they will increase your tariff after a month and that 7 does not include VAT charges I was a customer for last 6 months and was paying 1180month and saw their ad saying 7 questioned them about why they misleading according to what I was paying but was coming up will all excuses in the world like you they dont include VAT because it depends where you buying the credit from in every country VAT does not apply etc etc BE AWARE
There were NO repeat NO useful unpacking instructions for this oak origami Concoction It took two trained professionals almost 2 hours to decipher the instructions and put it together
Price was same as garages so made sense to have my four new tyres fitted at home Turned up on time  which was sadly was end of the good stuff The fitter sent can only be categorised as a clown Tried to tell me my car had been modified lowered  96 plate mgf 46k on the clock and 100 original and gave 101 reasons why he could not change the tyres All he had to do was ask me for my cars jack to enable to raise enough to allow him to get the trolley jack under the car Barely Rocket Science I received a call from Tyres on the drive and agreed to let them try again
Two fitters attended following day and fitted the four tyres
I am not angry  just very irritated and will not use again on my other vehicles
In response to your reply  you have simply skipped over the main issue The fitter you sent was clueless and his only value was pure entertainment to the neighbourhood  The Excellence Manager of this clown I would suggest is also failing I would really like some explanation as to the utter nonsense this guy was speaking and his inability to see the obvious solution staring him in the face Technical Managers  Technicians call them what you like fact is total incompetence ensures that such titles are worthless
Over 250 and not a lick of difference Cell reception is identical as before I had device installed Waste of money
Dangerous

co sent a wrong package and have not returned any corespondence to my requests
I decided to use this company based on the reviews offered here which paint a very rosey picture of blinds perfection With excitement and anticipation I ordered 3 blinds in January and waited to be overjoyed They arrived but one of them the Essence Cornsilk metal venetian blind 25mm was sadly the ugly duckling of the trio The website clearly showed this as a cream coloured blind and it appears when you search for beigenatural But when it arrived it was Green and the drawstrings were Pink Not anyones cup of Tea I contacted Blinds2go by phone who admitted that it was a bit odd and sent out a sample to compare and asked me to take photos for them to see The sample did match the blinds  because this was also greenSo I contacted Blinds2go again by polite email and mentioned all of the above and attached the photos The reply I got from Umar was very odd apparently I was annoyed never said that that the blind was too green for your liking its green and because I expressed frustration no I didnt I would just like a blind that isnt multi coloured but cream coloured such as it appears in the webpage Umar makes no mention of the pink drawstrings nor of the combination of pale green with pink that even Laurence Llewelyn Bowen would shy away from Finally Umar offers me a 25 discount a reorder whatever that means does that mean I have to order the blind again and will I get pink drawstrings or maybe blue green and purple all at once this time In conclusion of this sad tale I wlll be contacting blinds2go again thats if they dont care enough about their reputation to contact me first following this review
PS Re order with discount is the standard mantra of this company
This is the worst flower delivery experience everGranted I did not pay the extra for early delivery but to delivery flowers after 8pm is unacceptable
However I did pay for a large bouquet and this arrangement is not large Not only is it not large but it was not professionally arrange It was shoved down in the base and design like a spray the kind you would order for a funeral The flowers did not look fresh nor did they look like the picture on the website
No plant food was included No note card included  Also I ordered a happy birthday balloon and instead got a valentine heart balloon I am embarrassed that these were delivered to my mother for her birthday
And 4 customer service phone calls later I was offered to have the bad flowers picked up and new arrangements delivered They seem to have an attitude and annoyed that I was complaining Correct me if Im wrong but this is suppose to be a professional florist so why am I giving a do over  Frankly I just wanted a refund but after the drama i just cut My losses 
Just wont ever order from here againWish I had researched first because I would have saw the thousands and counting of complaints and over the years forthis business
Well First time using Home Living Style Can promise I will never shop there again I received notification that they cancelled my order and fully refunded my account When I asked why it was cancelled they accused me of knowing the price was wrong
This was the email reply that I received after confronting them on their business ethics and false accusations towards me Email from Danielle Kizz
First let me apologize it wasnt meant as an accusation The item you ordered is selling elsewhere for 23000 and up and you paid 12000

Its a shame they do business this way They obviously do not have competent workers that can adjust prices correctly and this is not the first time Home Style Living done this
They should really be proud of their business ethics
I got my name with a medical symbol the caduceus engraved You pay an additional 10 for this and the symbol came out horrible You cant even see what it is I would have sent it back but they dont allow you to if it was engraved which is ridiculous if the engraving came out with poor quality You cannot even tell what it is I should have went with something more solid like a star It says my first name caduceus then last name The symbol just looks like a random engravement To pay close to 200 for something just to find the engravement to come out so poorly maybe I should have purchased from one of the more expensive web sites The stethoscope itself is fine but again I spent this much in a stethoscope because I plan to have it for years now with very poor engraving And also know what you want before hand They do not let you return engraved items So this stethoscope works great but it is extremely heavy and bothers my neck so be mindful
I didnt appreciate the additional cost of 50c to pay with visa which was only disclosed at the final payment stage Also even though my payment included delivery the restaurant tried to make me lay again for delivery as they said their delivery fee was more than stated on the Marvin page This led to some embarrassment with the delivery driver and I now feel reluctant to order food from that restaurant again I will not use Marvin again nor will I recommend it
Bad experience on reedem cash points
Packed parts with clear wrap without box
The quality is not good at all My wig came without form 
I ordered 3 pair of glasses in a 500 strength All 3 of them arrived scratched so badly that I had to send them back Now Im irritated that I had to pay postage to return them As of yet I dont know if they will reimburse me for that postage Either way the fact that all of the glasses arrived scratched is very very bad
bought 2 pairs of sub zero speakers for home delivery 1 x 4  1 x 525 good price so i decided to pay the delivery charge shortly after i payed for them i had an email saying one was out of stock and would follow i received the first set no issue then the second set arrived the only issue was they had sent the same ones i had 2 pairs of the 4 tried to change them and gave up the will to live after over an hour on the chat will go to the shop and speak direct
I rent a car from Cairns the staff is terrible and they fraud me use the exist minor damage they took 3000 immediately from my card Please be careful to sign any contract with them and its very important to take a video of car when you take and return the car as evidence They are rubbish I am going to report to Fair community and maybe go to Small Claims Court I dont want to accept this unfairness
During the test drive I discovered there was no hood prop failing windshield wiper fluid and most importantly traces of white smoke from the engine When it was pointed out I was advised Id get a follow up to bring it in After purchasing the 07 Jeep Cherokee  the south side location I brought the vehicle back as the condition worsened Not because I ever received the follow up call The radiator has been replaced however it incurred a deductible in doing so Not having the money to cover it the lot now has the vehicle hostage Since the vehicle was delivered to me in this condition I shouldnt be responsible for the deductible Now this is hindering me and effecting my livelihood The lot seems to care more about 50 than the customer
Bought a pair of Giro Sentrie Techlace shoes
arrived without the insole adjusters
asked probikeit to send them please as they were missing
was told to take a photo and send it through of what thin air
contacted customer service team to send missing parts as soon as they can
I mean these were brand new shoes supposedly so how can it be missing
havent heard anything back yet very disappointed its such small part which should be in the mail straight away makes a difference to me though as I am not able to adjust the insoles as I would like
I booked a flight that was cancelled due to bad weather I was advised that I could use funds for a later flight When I attempted to use funds for a future flight restrictions were placed on the flights I could choose and they attempted to charge me a 250 rebooking feeI refused to pay the fee and they continue to keep my funds

I submitted a support request to this company in regards to my order after it was not delivered on the agreed upon date because of incorrect address The address was indeed correct and I requested a refund due to my partners Valentines Day being ruined by this error
I had no communication or offer of help I found that my request was closed without response because today I received a survey request on my experience with their support What support No one helped me No one checked in to assure me everything waswould be taken care of or to apologize Just a cold closed ticket and a slap to the face for wasting my time and money with them
I will never purchase from here again because they make it obvious they do not care about their customers
I bought a return ticket but after purchase was completed I noticed that one of the legs was replaced with another flight an impossible flight a flight that would have been left before my arrival After calling the customer support several times and hours of explaining the situation finally one of the personnel understood the problem and assured me that she will solve it However the next day I got an email from FlightHub that my booking was cancelled A waste of time 
So first i do the send in service and i get a call 8 days later telling me they cannot use my controller because its for the xbox one s thats understandable i get that so i upgrade to a prebuilt A couple weeks later my controller was still being painted So i emailed them and got a very sarcastic rude response another week goes by and my controller still is not ready i email them again they tell me that my controller will be shipped at noon on the day i email them a few more days go by and my controller still didnt ship they gave me some lame excuse that they had to patch the mod because of an update for infinite warfare they gave me the option to either leave it and send it or fix the mod i dont play infinite warfare so i didnt care yet they still did not send it finally i got a call a few days later telling me they were sending it finally i get the controller and its not even what i ordered i wanted a matte finish but received a gloss one they told me after i emailed them again that because i got a splatter on it that they had to put a gloss finish over it to stop it from coming off i wouldnt mind if i was informed prior but nope they dont care about the customers so in all i waited over a month to get my controller back and to get the controller i ordered the controller was NOT what i ordered and they could not care less that i am unhappy with their product Terrible service terrible company terrible controller Just buy the mod pack from walmart its better and has all the same features minus the custom controller that they will make wrong anyway
Excellent I would recommend you to anyone
Jomashop is not an authorized Citizen watch dealer Jomashops warranty does not cover water damage even though the watch model number jy803156l is rated to 20 bars or 660ft of water resistance I returned this watch and they will not issue a refund of 37300

This unit did not arrive as advertised Instead of a long and curly style that was uniform in length it had been cut to differing lengths After much tweaking there was little I could to to save it

Lastminutecom just charged me a credit card transaction when I paid by debit card I am ringing the customer service to get a refund of the transaction charge and no one is picking up Its now over 16 minutes on hold
I cant recommend them if they are impossible to get hold of Despite advertising 24 hr availability
Good value well made good service
I placed an order on 18122016 and stupidly another order on 1512017 Neither order has turned up Have had no response from newfrog so have applied for a refund via paypal Definately something fishy or very disorganised about their tracking  dispatch process
Not fresh green veg
Delivery included faulty item with security tag and no effort has been made to reimburse the customer or replace the item even after numerous requests Poor service
Recently purchased a shower caddy My husband attached to the wall with double sided tape provided Not even 24 hours later the caddy had fallen off the wall and broken Only soap solution like water would work in the dispensar
Ordered a pair a of frames that I wanted Persol PO2374V 513 Ordered in Dec of 2016 Used my FSA as payment Was told the frames were backordered could be 3  4 weeks ok I waited until mid January then Im told will most likely be a very long time IF they do get these frames in stock
Was told I could get a refund I used my FSA and that money would not have come back to my acct due to it being the new year Was told sorry you can order a different set of frames I dont want another set I wanted what I originally ordered
Meanwhile through this entire process your website shows that the frames I want are still in stock So you are still selling frames that you dont have to unsuspecting people
I have not chosen Energia In fact I recently left for a different supplier due to NO customer service as already conveyed to Energia
I bought and paid flight After a few days I got a notice the flight isnt available after all and my money will be returned The money was eventually returned but I had to get a lot more expensive last minute replacement ticket for my trip from another company No responsibility do not trust
I cannot review as I have not received my order Further it is a gift for my daughter who works standing up
This company has horrible customer care I just spent over 20 minutes on the phone with them trying to figure out how they obtained personal information on me that I did not give to them and listening to them tell me that they refused to remove my information from their records and refuse to confirm via email to me that the membership that they claim that i have with them was cancelled They have emailed me incessantly since I placed an order with them in December and today called me twice to my work phone I spoke to a supervisor who was worse than the agent
Item not delivered Only platitudes in response to my email enquiries and still no item or refund This may only be one seller but they give the entire site a bad name
I am from GREECE I bought from that site a phone MEIZU MX4 PRO which had problem with graphics which means the gpu had problem I communicate with them with e mailafter their request i sent videos to show that problem They told to sent it back to CHINA to fix the problem as i did Then they sent back to me but the problem in gpu remained They told to sent it back for second time and that happened and 3RD TIME They didnt do nothing they didnt fix the problem and they didnt sent me new phone because it was obviously that the phone is crearly malfunction Their behavior was unprofessional Dont buy anything from them They are amateurs
You send me a catalog and tell me I am preapproved for credit and when I place an order you tell me just the opposite and you want a down payment That is very misleading and I dont like it at all
So many of the recent reviews bear an uncanny resemblence to the experience that I just had with Liftopia Customer Service over their rather arbitrary rules that apply for a Drs note to validate an illness that prevented use of tickets on the intended day In my case I got the required note from our sons Pediatrician explaining that his stomach virus prevented us from going to Mt Sunapee on the day planned and using the Liftopia tickets that Id purchased for my wife and I for the Sunday of MLK wknd the kids tix were included in their ski school which we of course got a credit for future use for I was told that they couldnt help me as the Drs note met all of their requirements EXCEPT their deadline 10days after the ticket date by which it needs to be submitted to be considered for a refundcredit
I explained that after that weekend I was on an overseas business trip 8 hrs time difference so got into an endless game of phone tag with our pediatrician so it took 25 wks to get the signed note on letterhead The response that elicited was priceless if youd reached out to ask for an extension to the 10day deadline we might have considered that but since you didnt we really cant help you My multiple requests for an explanation on where the 10day deadline comes from went unanswered and it quickly became clear that Katie the Customer Service Supervisor my call was escalated to was getting tired of reading her script of talking points so the call just fizzled out
They must be in a real cash crunch these days and their desperation is by no means subtle  and it was really striking how comfortable they were sticking it to a good customer whos used them many times over the past few years Ive seen a lot of amateur decisions in my 20 yrs working in hospitality around the world but the call I had tonight was a new low
The only reason they get even 1 star was the pleasant call I had with Justin when I first called in on Jan 15th
I was disappointed in how few books this website actually purchased I spent SO long entering all of the numbers and then found that they would only accept a fraction of what I had And they were ALL really nice books I think that I would not use this company again based on that
I will say that they made the process of mailing in my books seamless and easy
Arrived at barcelona airport and the incapacitated guy at the desk unable to provide any serviceassistance gave me a car after paying deposit 1500E that was all scratched and with several bumps He told me to check the car in the dark and without assistance I had to cancel everything and deal with holiday autos for a refund
Worse experience Do not sacrifice quality for a few euros
Reply how it works it work wrongly Telling people to check your cars at night might be your profitable strategy AVOID AVOID
I was charged all the money before they told me to check the car Would it be wiser to do it the other way round
Please do not use
Bout a ten dollar card and when I tried to put it on it said invalid Im very disappointed and want my money back I paid 13 or would like it put into my account would be nice too Trying to rent a movie for my little one here
At first I was really excited about the features autoattendant smart forwarding rules free extensions free fax But then things werent working like they were supposed to dropped calls bad call quality calls not routing properly and small limits on fax size The company is very cool in concept but needs to improve the quality of their technology I hope they get it together
The Ecco site needs more information regarding size and width
Du dans mes attentes
I purchased a pair of expensive Roman Blinds from Blinds2go and the product I received was a different size to the accurate measurements I had provided leaving us with two useless illfitting blinds
Before contacting customer services I checked my order which was correct and then phoned to find out if a mistake had been made and to discuss the best way to rectify the situation
I was told by a very rude woman that they always take a certain amount off the measurements provided and as far as they are concerned the blinds were correct I was told that this is clearly on the website and that I obviously hadnt I read it properlyapparently the only thing she could do was offer me a discount a measly 10 off a replacement pair In essence buy another pair of blinds
Rubbish rubbish rubbish Why would I even consider spending any more money with this company if they cant get it right in the first place I told her this was not a satisfactory resolution for me and I would either want a replacement pair of blinds made to my original measurements or a full reimbursement because they are faulty  she wouldnt agree to either and now I am hundreds of pounds out of pocket
While on the call I checked what they actually state on the website a short phrase which wasnt that easy to find says that the company does indeed deduct some off the measurement to create a perfect fit This is completely laughable as it wasnt a perfect fit at all
What Blinds2go clearly dont know is how wide or narrow the window frames are so the blinds I received do not fit anywhere near perfectly and I have large strips of light coming in each sidethey do not create a nice dark room and look ridiculous because they are clearly too narrow
My final point to the women was that if my measurements were incorrect I would take full responsibility for this but as Blinds2go had taken it upon themselves to reduce the width creating a far from perfect fit they would need to rectify it She repeated all she could do was give a discount off a replacement pair
I am completely astonished by this apalling customer service and inability rectify an error which is theirs
Please do not give them your custom
Package was opened and Damaged
Staff is not very helpful
I sent 20 emails requesting a shipping label and it never came They kept promising it but to no avail I am now waiting for a refund almost a week Jury is still out
So i had two separate booking with last minute One for flights and the other for the hotel I rang up to change the time of the return flight everthing was resolved and i was told to expect an email with an alternate flight time which i could choose to accept if i wish Two minutes later i receive an email cancelling my hotel Less than a week before the holiday this took 4 days to resolve many phone calls and wasted time Eventually the original hotel deal was offered back to me but at a higher price Unbelievable will never use last minute again
First of all they take down reviews that are anything but positive
My GM MDI scanner took over 3 weeks to be shipped Nothing was happening on it until I emailed them and started posting where is my product on their review site When they finally acknowledged it they said it would have to wait another week because Chinese New Year was starting the next day did I mention I bought this on their Chinese New Year Sale
When I finally got it I cannot get any of the 3 computers in my house to recognize it I emailed them for support and they sent me video links for YouTube After trying to follow the videos closely and getting even further away from success I emailed them my setup log files They did not respond to the log files but they told me that the videos where for another product but would give me an idea of what needed to be done but I should really follow the instructions on the CD rom that came with the product
They never have commented on my logs
Lastly I thought that I might buy the Wifi card for it since the USB was giving me grief I was told that unlike the real MDIs the one I bought cannot be upgraded I said that it was not listed that way on the website but they said that their ad states GM MDI with USB Like that tells you that the WIFI cards have nothing to plug in to Every MDI has USB That is most likely the reason why the network jack shows no activity it is not hooked to anything
The product looks nice I just cannot get it to work and they cannot seem to help me

this company is a joke I look up for some recess trim and led all in one lights and came up with these rab lights the price was around 13 and so I was something is not rt here so I call in an speak to a rep and verify the price and they say no the price is correct So I said please send me an email with the order confirmation I told him I needed the lights by 1172017 which again was told it was correct and I should have them by that time shipment is coming from Tennessee Then last night Im like crap I have gotten them yet what going on I look and they canceled the order are you kidding me they canceled it because the pricing was not correct I called them and confirmed the pricing was on the line with them for 12 minutes so they could verify the pricing then call them and I get told people make mistakes Not in this situation I called you to verify the price told you I needed them by Tuesday and you cancel the order without even letting me know they say they sent me an email but Im sure it went to junk and why would I be looking for an email by them I verified it with them Now I dont have light and out thousands with workers there trying to put in lights today
I was shipped the wrong size lug nuts and will send back for credit
not happy with the service i bought a voucher which didnt work I then spoke to customer service who notified me i would get the voucher within 24 hours
without any further correspondence I received an email saying my entire order had be cancelled and i would be reimbursed I have not yet received my money back
The man was polite and nice no grumbles there But they couldnt fix it and yet the AA came along and did it in 20 minutes I was charged 25 call out for incompetance in my opinion I explained in detail the problem on the phone to the man and he said it would be no problem I will not be using this service again  costly mistake

It took an average of about ten times to access the website the browser continually displayed an error message and then once I was in I kept getting so far with my booking before the website displayed an error message and I had to restart
They take money for delivery and donot ask for signed delivery and thenot dont refund money instead asks you to jump through hoops its been more than a month and the customer service always says they will refund tomorrow and keep postponing it everyday
PER QUELLO CHE HO PAGATO MI ASPETTAVO UNA MIGLIORE QUALITA
Hey
I had no update regarding my recent order im extremely disappointed and have noticed that its not only me hence im writing to inform future customers to be careful
I booked my parcel through monkey parcel with dx it was booked in night for next morning waited till 3 oclock phoned them to asked when its going to be collected they said they have nothing on their system about that address but they were quick to withdrew money of my paypal and give their tracking number and they still never had it on their system now i asked for refund lets see what happens its going to take 3to5 days but in withdrawing it took less than a minute third class service
The items didnt fit We were not aware the customs were not included in the shipping fees Paid over 100 dollars in customs fees With the huge customs fees it wasnt worth returning and getting a new set We were informed we would have to pay duty on the new items as well So we will be forced to try and sell privately
Ive asked repeatedly to be taken off their email list yet they continue to spam me with emails Annoying
they havent told me how it is possible for new and genuine mobile battery can only last 12 a day refund process was smooth though quick response and offered full refund with postage

Scam site
I signed up to this site then spoke to a chat agent I was asking simple questions about what the play through amount was and max bet stake per spin but he was acting like he never knew what I meant  finally all I got was a link to the tcs after reading it seems to be that if you deposit using Skrill or PaySafeCard etc you need to play through your normal deposit 10 times  to take out real money  if that is not enough to put you off I sent my verification documents right away as I always do on sign up and got a message today saying Hi
Thank you for your email
For security reasons we can no longer accept scanned or online issued documents
Simply take a clear picture of them with your digital camerasmart phone and email them to us directly
Your proof of address must be a utility bill OR bank statement that was posted to your home address in the last three months Please note that we do not accept online statements
I have used the same documents to verify at every online casinos so it is nonsense and lucky for me I never deposited or got to the withdrawal stage but I imagine if you did take a picture they would come back and say the picture is not clear or readable if you do a review search on the site you will find it rife with complaints of people not getting withdrawals or demands for documents then accounts frozen including a 66 year old sick pensioner I would not trust this site at all and although I was not affected I am posting this to give you a heads up 
I was given wrong information about my order Didnt receive when promised When called to complain I was spoken to by a very rude rep Nothing was resolved so I closed my account was a VIP customer and nothing was offered to apologize for my disappointment Just rudeness Still very upset for my hostile treatment
kan niet slechter zooi
I placed an order on 101 ProBikekit advised a EST Delivery Date between 241  251 I contacted them in early Feb and advised them that I had not yet received delivery which was quite unusual as I had always received deliveries on or around the EST Deliver Date advised They advised that I had to wait 30 Days Today I received an item from Probikekit which I ordered 17 days after the now missing Order Thinking that this would confirm to Probikekit that this particular order had gone astraymissing especially when I had received an order I had placed 17 days after I made contact with them today to initiate proceedings Thinking that this would be enough proof that the delivery was lost and being only 1 day from the 30Days I would have thought that ProbIkeKit would have assumed the same and commenced with their investigations and maybe actually send another one in its place due to the fact that 29 days had passed
But no I have to wait another day as we would have to allow the full 30 days before we can look in to this How ridiculous The fact that I had received a delivery from them which I had ordered 17 days after the missing order is not enough proof that the parcel is missing
The last time I buy anything from these jokers Stay away
Dior processed my order for a face cream as a gift for my wifes birthday They were out of stock on the item but didnt tell me that Instead they gift wrapped and shipped only the freegift and i only found out as she was opening it They get 2 stars only because the phone guy handling the call was nice about refunding my money
we received the wrong part the person i spoke to originally said they were in stock and when we received them  they were the wrong ones when i called back the person told me they never had the original part i was looking for and ordered that i ordered the part i received i walked him through the web site where i found the part i was wanting and that is when i was told they never had this one in stock i asked him then why would someone tell me they were in stock when i inquired in the first place he then informed me all sales were final and hung up so our company has almost 40000 worth of product we do not need i do not recommend this company due to the lack of customer service
If you value your sanity DO NOT USE Flight Hub I have spent 4 days trying to rebook 2 airplane tickets The customer service has given me the run around consistently I called Air Canada and they confirmed the lack of service and knowledge by the Flight Hub employees It feels as if they are refusing to allow me to use the 105784 credit I have with them I have asked to speak to a supervisor 2 times and both times the person is not available After speaking with so many of the employees at Flight Hub I can guarantee you that the call center is not located in North America as it is difficult to understand every person I have spoken with Very POOR customer service
purchased tickets to Bruce Springsteen concert at Hunter Valley Australia They were selling for 150 Australian dollars was charged U K pounds total price 560 Did not receive an email to down load tickets after sending many emails and no response from Viagogo had to make 4 calls to U K and a total of 5 hours before finally getting them to email tickets that were received at 11 pm the night before travelling to the event Absolutely discussed with this company the experience left me financially worse off and very stressedWould never use them again
The experience was only a bit slow The hair is not the color advertised A T1b30 should be an offblack with the tips 30 This hair is not close to my hair color at the roots at all Its more of a 4 with slightly lighter tips The lighter hair is a lot more course by day 3 but ive made it work for now Im afraid to order a solid color bc the roots are not 1B
We reserved a TWO BEDROOM 2 BATH RUN OF HOUSE unit at Northstar and got a 1 12 bathroom unit  in other words just one shower Northstar management refused to fix that and says its Skicoms fault So I wrote to Skicom and got nothing but an automated response apparently indicating that my assigned travel agent there is out for a few days Skiing maybe
Redeeming Skicoms lift ticket vouchers at Northstar was an incredible hassle We actually went in to the ticket office late in the day before we wanted to start skiing to make sure that went OK The kid at the counter had to consult with a manager to figure out what to do and it took about half an hour At the gondola the next morning only one of our lift passes actually worked We had to dig up the reservation out of email on an iPhone and blow the first half hour of our skiing time getting it fixed
If you are headed for Northstar it seems the odds are pretty high that youll be treated badly if you book through Skicom I really really wish I hadnt done it
4 attempts to pick up a BBQ package
1 Initial purchase  where some items were unavailable
2 Confirmed by phone the rest was there reconfirmed in store this was the case Made to sit in the loading dock full sun on a 40 degree day only to be told pieces were still unavailable  that apparently my experience that day was the same as the shop assistants experience of picking up an iPhone when he waited for 10 minutes in an air conditioned shopping centre Told to come back on the weekend
3 Sunday 4pm went in as asked  told not available and that I should ring before I go to the store
Rung Monday at 930am to be told the remaining parts had arrived at the store in the Friday shipment  could I come that day
4 Finally got the remaining parts
Totally frustrating experience Will not shop at the Canberra BBG againg
I paid 90 for 23 day shipping It took over two weeks Apparently eGlobal did not choose priority handling for the Australian shipping so my package languished in Melbourne for over a week travelling as off peak mail Very unhappy about this waste of money
I never received the product nor a return email on the status of the product
No confirmation mail no reply to emails no place to cancel Absolute nothing worked Creditcard charged Tried everything to come in contact no tel nos Is this a real serious website for booking transfer from airport to hotel and back
Extremely difficult to pay and check out Site forgot my address after 7 years of business Could not access any coins from drop down menues which caused me to not be able to purchase any of the one dozen Australian silver i planed to buy this evening
Waited on the phone for ages and then needed to get a call back Website booking options need to be clearer Inc picture of accommodation types and guidelines with what to book
Due to the advertised statement claiming to deliver the next day IE on Valentines Day  this did not happen
The quality was just OK
This is one customer that will not return
Despite attempting to place the order in Berlin the order was shipped the next day from Greven near the Belgium border ca 400km away 
I paid 4095 in shipping cost in order to have the material the next day The delivery was delayed by a week but I was not provided any type of a refund
I tried to place my order online there was a problem with their web site had to call in to place my order and it cost me more money Was not real happy with that
Bought over the telephone very polite and helpful delivery well within the given time period Furniture itself very good for the price and we are very happy with that One little issue with faulty handles but new ones being sent so problem resolved easily All good to that point
Delivery was another experience on time but no call to say they would be with us soon no pleasantries in fact hardly a word spoken and couldnt work out if they were in a bad mood or just rude One item was skidded up the drive and then rolled several times the rest of the way when there were 2 delivery staff that could have easily carried it I caught it all on CCTV and sent footage but it doesnt seem to have been taken too seriously The furniture was luckily undamaged due to excellent packaging There was a fragile symbol luckily no glass to break otherwise could have been a different scenario It was taken to a room of choice where it was all left upside down despite clear which way up arrows
Maybe 2 stars is a bit harsh but my purchase of nearly 700 was disrespected
Conclusion great furniture and seller but probably best to collect in person Avoid courier until they get issues resolved
I have yet to receive any of the books I ordered
Honestly never had a bad experience with pro civic however their choices in shipping products through ontrac should be reviewed The 100 satisfaction and top service guarantee seemed otherwise after this last order I made Im thankful for finally receiving my order  but feel the delivery could have gone smoother
well it is impossible to give lower rating BEWARE of this company they try to make you to pay for the goods you have never received or received few weeks after paying instead of promised 3 days of delivery when you lost the hope to ever see anything They sent the invoice for paying for the good when they didnt deliver it they lie they sent replacement straight away when in fact again one week passes
All of that would not be the worst but they tried to intimidate me into paying via its aggressive customer service representative who wouldnt last a day in any decent company Germany is famous for being a customer service black hole and CLS Computer and its rude employees are not helping to change it JUST BEWARE AMAZONDE AFTER READING THEIR EMAILS TO ME TOLD THEM TO STOP CONTACTING ME IMMEDIATELY DIDNT HELP UNFORTUNATELY no more businesses with quasi companies like that why  they are hundreds of better companies who value honesty and its customers
I have not received my check yet and its been more than 5 days since shipped out
Horrible experience after paying for my order and assuming it was being processed I asked a couple of questions via email and without warning my order was canceled and refunded for no apparent reason I was very confused and asked what happened via email and was told that they did not want to do business with me and if I wrote them back any further I would be blacklisted I suppose for asking questions how dare I LOL Buyer beware It definitely was the most bizarre thing I had ever had happen to me after attempting to purchase something online I am sorry but people should be able to ask questions about what they are purchasing without being blacklisted Allinall extremely bizarre and unprofessional Honestly had never had a worse experience online
I placed an order on 122916 paid via PayPal  I have still not received merchandise or notification of shipping
Unfortunately the connection is poor whenever I call to Manila  Price is good but can not understand my parents and they cant hear me

Do Not ever buy anything from home zone Bed does not fit the king mattress I was told Thats the way its supposed to be BS
As an IT person I understand that design of websites is pertinent to a customers shopping experience
This site has bad links everywhere automatic filters dont remove items that are out of stock or out in a specific size instructions regarding updating billing info dont work and if youre lucky enough to be able to check out with one hour when trying to purchase a few sports bras  the items will be out of stock by the time you complete your transaction This is not the first third or even fifth time this has happened
I tried to have flowers delivered to my girlfriend in Hamburg on Valentines Day I got a strange email from Blume2000 late in the day telling me my girlfriend was actually in Denmark and they were going to destroy my flowers and charge me I think we would know where my girlfriend was I emailed them back almost immediately and still havent heard back days later Im really upset at not just the fact that the flowers werent delivered but the follow up service I entered my phone number during ordering The least they could have done is call to confirm where my girlfriend was before destroying the flowers I wont be ordering from Blume2000 again

You could have gone to Walmart or Home Depot and purchased replacement feet the next day Shame on you for not taking care of this
I am someone who works and customer relations and I cannot believe the service I have received
I have a trip booked to New Zealand in April with 6 people I booked the flight under my maiden name my passport was under my maiden name but unfortunately my passport got damaged and I was told to get a new one Because I started the process of legally changing my name I HAD to get my new passport in my married name I called New Zealand Air and sent them all my information  they said it was possible but I had to go through Flight Hub I have been on the phone with Flight Hub almost every day minimum 1 hour calls most of the time on hold and every day I am given an excuse or a change in story or a different reason why they cannot change my name blaming Air New Zealand blaming policy blaming me In all honesty  I didnt want to get a new passport but unfortunately I did Now I just need help to solve this issue but two weeks have passed the price of the flight keeps going up and I still have no idea if I will be going on this trip The customer service has been so rude they have brought me to tears more than once I just need to change my name on my ticket and I cant understand why this is so impossible especially when Air New Zealand had all the information and said yes they would do it They have told me they would call me back with information and never have I have to call every day and they are saying Air New Zealand isnt opened although I can call on the other line and they are there
I cannot believe a company operates this way I cannot believe customer service would treat someone this way and I cant believe I may not be going on a trip because of a lack of customer service  the exact reason they are there I will never ever use Flight Hub again  I will tell everyone and anyone about this experience and I cant believe I am being penalized because my name has been legally changed
Cant access the Hub account Otherwise ok
I booked through rentalcarscom and in my confirmation it clearly said that I will be refunded for any fuel left in the tank when I drop the car off Instead of being refunded it was the other way around I was charged an additional 50 for fuel Just terrible
UPDATE
I see you posted a reply but it doesnt make any sense You say I was refunded 51 but like I said in my original review I was CHARGED and additional 51
Last year I contacted Pelican Water Systems after moving to the north east Never having an experience with hard water I was at my wits end with the calcium and magnesium all over everything that water contacted
I studied the products and even dialoged with two different experts at Pelican about the problem prior to buying I chose to go with the salt free system and spent 213582
The system does nothing for the calcium and magnesium When I contacted the company the man I spoke with told me to buy a traditional water softener I could not believe this What it boils down to is I should not have wasted over two thousand dollars and I will never buy one of their systems again
Bad very poor
I dont accept the change for my tickets I need cancel my payment and get refund Ive already bought another ticket back to Helsinki I dont need any ticket anymore Please request for my refund Yesterday I called your company for 13minutes it costs me 5 e they told me they will help me ask refund Now you tell me the changed time was confirmed i am very angry

Ive Booked with them for years Called in and Had a Representative that Didnt communicate Properly The Wrong Flight was Selected when i asked for it to be customized After we Booked called in to get it fixed and I was Treated Horribly the customer services skills are Horrible
I BOOKED MY FLIGHTS  AFTER THAT I DISCOVER THE DATE Changed because something wrong in your system
Spent 3 hours on phone to get no were
I bought the VIP Photon Express Kit in Pavillions swords two weeks ago the tank was leaking so i brought it back the guy had a look at it and told me it was fixed when i got home the same thing happened again I live in Ashbounre comeath and dont drive so it means getting two buses in each time to get in looked at
I purchased a item almost a month I received a confirmation from Amiclub that the package has arrived by UPS I called UPS and was told that the package was delivered to the local postal office Its being 5 days now and the package havent delivered I tried calling customer with no answer I went by the local postal office and was told they never received any package from UPS in my name Now my package is nowhere to be found I need a full refund Do not buy from them Worst company to do business with Suck without a doubt
I booked by rentalcarscom The deal was great I waited nearly 3hours at Barcelona Airport to pick up my car At the office was only 1 and sometimes 2 people there and the queue of customers was long When I returned the car they charged me additional coast because I was only few minutes late I tried to call them but the office desk was unfriendly and I sent so many emails until I finally got the answer  everything was for nothing I will never ever rent a car there
The reciever was not at home The delivery guy left the package in front of the door in a crowded street and of course it was stollen I have sent an email to Euroflorist but never got an answer or refund
All the extras that I had requested when I rented the car through Argus were never sent to the rental office Therefore I find myself going to the mountains in February without winter tires snow chains and skirack The rental company Enterprise in Lyon have confirmed that they never have received the request and that I it had been requested they would have had all the equipment Really bad experience and Argus just says there is nothing they can do about it I feel really helpless
If they find another car from another rental office at a higher price I will have to pay the difference Not fair since I booked well in advance and now all cars are between 32400 above the price I booked at Their suggestion was that I cancelled my reservation and got another one Right

We paid 145 EUR for opodo trip insurance as an addon to our ticket price My daughter hit her head and required medical attention preventing us from taking the trip We had paid 3200 EUR for the flight The trip insurer asked for a more detailed invoice from opodo than what had been provided to us when we purchased the ticket They wanted a break down of the ticket price in terms of taxes The invoice provided by opodo listed 23 of the ticket price as airport tax and the insurance company claimed that they were not responsible for refunding airport tax even though this made up most of the ticket price They also refused to refund on the basis of serious injury even though we provided medical documentation of my daughters injury They insisted that we were only eligible for refund on the basis of unavoidable problem This left us with a refund offer of 800 EUR on a 3200 EUR ticket with 145 EUR of trip insurance
When signing up to Energia I was given information that was not correct and the monthly fee was grossly under what it should have been I have since had to agree to increase my monthly payments and extend my contract by 6 months to spread the additional cost
I have never felt compelled to write a bad review for any company however my experience was so infuriating and shocking I feel the need to warn others and possibly save them from this experience This is the first time I purchased from HOUZZ and I will never purchase anything from them again I spent more than 1700 for a 72 inch vanity and paid for the room of choice delivery WHAT A SCAM The delivery company came to my front door argued with me that it was just curb drop After calling their supervisor they confirmed that it was in fact a room of choice delivery Then the delivery men argue with me that they cant bring the vanity to my room of choice on the second floor because its too heavy and its only two of them there I asked why offer service that you cant provide His response I paid HOUZZ for the service and they are just subcontractors After about 25 minutes of discussion back and forth about how heavy it is the vanity was left in my entrance way I made several calls to HOUZZ and the delivery company but was just placed in voice mail I finally spoke to a HOUZZ customer service rep who said she would send the correct department an email explaining what has happened and said that I would get a call back I never did I then opened up the box to find the marble back splash broken into 4 pieces and the counter top cracked in 4 places with the back of the vanity split in 2 places I took 15 photos of the damage and sent an email that same day to HOUZZ asking for a call Waited Waited Waited Nothing I waited 2 days and then I called customer service and was transfer 3 times and then dumped into voice mail The only way I was able to speak to someone was to choose the automated option of making a purchase   HOUZZ takes your money a lot easier than it addresses their horrible service I was never able to speak to a manager Nor would the customer service rep ever tell me the name of any manager I finally was transferred to Allison a supervisor who offered NO satisfactory resolution NOT even an acknowledgement of the terrible service So I have a vanity in pieces in my entrance way I have to wait for a carrier to come an pick it up and then only then will I get my refund
The irony the came vanity was on sale with Wayfair for 200 cheaper but I purchased it through HOUZZ because they said they could get it delivered quicker

Prebooked a hire car from Goldcar rental through AutoEurope Paid an all inclusive price for the car including additional refundable excess insurance online before leaving the UK and arranged to pick up the car from Palma Mallorca Airport After queueing for over 90 minutes at the Goldcar desk but thats another story I handed over confirmation of booking to the Goldcar representative who then asked to swipe my credit card supposedly to cover any deficiency in fuel upon return of the car which I agreed to They hand you a PDA with a blank screen to sign and then superimpose your signature onto a digitally created agreement which they then put into a folder and hand to you I returned the car at the end of the hire period unmarked and with a full tank of fuel 4 weeks after my trip I received my credit card statement to find that Goldcar had deducted 23581 more than the actual cost of the car hire from my credit card for additional insurance which was neither discussed nor agreed to This is shocking and fraudulent behaviour and according to AutoEurope not an uncommon practice by Goldcar Following protracted correspondence with Goldcar Customer Services they maintain that Ive had the benefit of the insurance so will not reimburse me AutoEurope have purportedly investigated but quite frankly a complete waste of time
If you must use Goldcar for car hire QUESTION AND THOUROUGHLY CHECK WHAT YOU ARE SIGNING FOR BEFORE YOU WALK AWAY FROM THE DESK Goldcar have now had my money for 225 days
NOTE TO GOLDCAR  PLEASE DO NOT KEEP POSTING YOUR INANE COMMENTS YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICES DEPARTMENT HAS NOT PROVIDED A SATISFACTORY RESPONSE PLEASE JUST ANSWER THE FOLLOWING POINTS AS REQUESTED
1 GIVEN THAT YOU WERE AWARE THAT I HAD PURCHASED REFUNDABLE EXCESS INSURANCE AS PART OF MY DEAL WITH AUTOEUROPE WHY WERE THE TWO INSURANCE OPTIONS NOT MENTIONED AT THE TIME OF COLLECTING THE CAR YOU JUST DEBITED 23581 FROM MY CREDIT CARD WITHOUT EVEN ASKING OR DISCUSSING IT THIS IS EFFECTIVELY THEFT
2 WHY WOULD I LOGICALLY AGREE TO TAKE OUT THE OPTION OF YOUR SUPER RELAXED COVER WHEN I ALREADY HAD THE BENEFIT OF REFUNDABLE DEPOSIT COVER FROM AUTOEUROPE
You have my contact details should you wish to discuss however as I have previously stated I will keep posting this review until you refund my money in full

So me and a friend were looking for cheap low slot ark servers I cam across this one I went to order an ark server with 4 slots because the option was there and the price was at 575 cad so i went to place my order and said i needed an account so i was like ok made one and then went to place it again and it was grayed out screen with a pop up saying you need to charge your account with money ok so i get my friend to donate 3 and i charged 5 in total it was 8CAD when i went to order again it said minimum slot was 8 and that it now costed 14CAD I wanted my money back so i went to support They said

I will forward this ticket to the corresponding department to fullfill the

Id ask for your patience and understanding
The money was taken out of the account the next day A week later no money was refunded and i had to escalate the dispute on paypal They basically stole my money
I just recently called the Sparefoot Storage  requested a 24hour access storage location I was given a location  was Quote d 15 setup fee plus no need for insurance  no contract needed Well when we got there it WASNT a 24 hour access location the fee of 15 was only for 4 days we did need insurance and had to sign a contract Now how can the information given to me be so INCORRECT Do these companies not talk to each other as to what they are offering The good thing was that since we were told it was a 24hour access the agent provided us with that We ended having to pay a prorated rate
Changed my mind within 8 hours but they are adamant that there is no cooling off period
The reason for changing was that I found a cheaper deal elsewhere
Wont use these again due to the cancellation policy and they dont recognise the distance selling act
very slow service need faster delivery
The rep I spoke to was nice enough but I asked him at the start were there any additional charges like an installation fee He said he didnt know of any Well after 10 mins giving him all my info he says theres an 80 installation fee I said theres no reason I have my own modem and the house is already wired for it He then put me on hold for 10 mins and came back with another person on the line saying there wouldnt be a installation fee but I had to wait until Wednesday it was Friday to get my service turned on Well thats ridiculous in and of it self but then somehow my order was canceled I contacted the service provider to double check the connection date on Tuesday and I didnt have one The service provider rep not only put the order back in but it was on in a couple of hours without anyone coming out or installation fee In My Area wasted 5 days of me not having internet and in turn costed the service provider money On top of that once the order is placed In My Area cant help at all I will never use and will warn others not to use In My Area
transaction not as smooth as other online eye shopping
You are Quote d one amount online then when you go in to set up your account they charge you extra for the lock that is already a part of the storage unit And they tell you that you must have insurance on your unitWhile we were there it seemed like ALOT of people are frustrated with the late fees It is probably because they dont mail out an invoice each month or a text either You have to remember to pay each month yourself or else

First of all sorry for my english this is not my first langage My command was 3 tomato costums The delivery was really good and fast one day faster than first announced The problem is about the costums  compared to the picture showed on the website a well rounded red tomato the costums was rather like a whitered tomato The costum seams are not good The price about 50 euros is really too expensive for that So im a little bit dissapointed

I ordered flowers and a balloon CAD 8000 to surprise my daughter studying in Portland
Flowers arrived a day too late without balloon and delivered at the wrong door 
Surprise was gone she had to go and search for the bouquet herself
After complaining they promised to do a full refund What we received was an email saying refund was CAD 1500
We phoned back left our number but never received a call back
Flowers are very expensive and horrible service 
Site states unlock for free  Not free at all total scam
My online order sat for five days with no communication I had to check status online to discover they due to their internal policies werent going to honor my prescription and the order was dead Again no communication Wouldnt have been as big of a deal if this had been an order for say dog treats Phone reps only response was we sent you an email Sorry not good enough and no email came in Lens Discounters and 1800Contacts are competent try them

Web shop that sells shoes and does not offer a free return when every other shop does automatically discourages purchases This was my only purchase which I will return unless they change their policy
Its been 7 weeks since I placed my order from miniinthebox Still no package but the money has been paid
I tried making a purchase on Presidents Day As I was shopping I saw all of the Presidents Day Sale prices but my bag did not reflect this I removed several items as a result
Youve gone so far that its impossible to read reviews on your site without the app I dont want your app
The address on my package was wrong blame it on the computer the county number for the road was placed on it automatically so my package was returned  I had to trace the package make the call to Frames Direct to ask when they would be resentThis first time I was told I would have to call back on Wednesday and let them know my package address was wrong then they could change address and resendSo when I called back I was told they would be resent I requested tracking number still no notafacation of when my glasses would be returnedOn and on finally one month later I got the glassesI wish could have given a better opinion but poor customer service has no excuses
I honestly hate purolator For the umpteenth time I had to pick up a package at a location just because they wouldnt ring my bell 101 of the time I am home If I am paying for a delivery then it is because I want it delivered to my house Why do I have to stress myself to come over to a location again I could have easily gone to the mall to get it Today I saw the driver paste a note on the door without even trying to ring the bell Then he dashed back into his truck Here in Calgary you guys need to purge your staff and train new ones to work efficiently Im highly disgusted by this company
HAR IKKE FET MINE TING
I ordered flowers to be sent to my girlfriend who was in Barcelona for the week Even though I paid way too much for the flowers for valentines day I still paid extra for expedited shipping They never came on the 14th so I waited out the 15th because I understood they were really busy for the holiday On the 16th the order status claimed they were delivered which was false When I contacted customer service I received an email back in terrible english with multiple misspellings explaining how no one was home and the phone number I had given did not existwas inaccurate I then went on to double check the number and it was indeed the correct number ignoring the fact that my girlfriend was home all day After contacting them again they refused to give me a refund because of the order its already done their grammar not mine My girlfriend is no longer in Barcelona and now has no valentines day gift This company is beyond unacceptable and very unprofessional
UPDATE Their agent offered me a 10 discount code for my next order so I paid 90 for 10 off my next order which I wont be using
Very unsatisfied
Car that I bought on Feb 10th had to be towed the very same day and I still have not received a loaner car to get back and forth to work it has been very inconvenient feel as if I am getting the run around so far I am not very happy with my experience

I have not had a very positive experience with this service I signed up for the weekly rate for Premium Membership about a week ago and really have not seen nor experienced much added value from this service I have not received any job alerts based on my profile like most other job boardsmost of which are free and no responses from the multitude of applications I submitted So when I went into the site to downgrade today 8 days later I am shocked to find out that they renewed me for another month rather than just for another week like I was lead to believe This is VERY MISLEADING so please beware There is no phone support which is a bit concerning to begin with So the only way to try to resolve this problem is through a generic support email address I am not optimistic and may have to file a dispute through my credit card Proceed with caution
I did receive a response the same day following my initial review above They indicated that they would provide a courtesy refund based on the misunderstanding of their policy I have since verified that the refund was posted back into my account
Placed orders for 3 items and chose to pay expedited shipping on all 3 A couple of days later after order had been placed sellers for 2 of the items wanted additional shipping since the items were oversize Correct shipping prices should be Quote d up front
Like everyone else i didnt received my order
They didnt even answer on facebook or via email support
Great idea but no customer service and the card takes forever The old app had a better layout than the new one Not than any have worked completely
I have just redeemed physical gold and silver and on the transaction you are charged 45 for delivery on each transaction and 05 grams of gold from account
I was then charged by ups at my door at 930 am without any notification receipt or invoice Or any explanation 10844p I then call ups who had to investigate Apparently its the shipping company they use from the united states called d g w in dallas but I paid for gold and silver from my uk vault So that is obviously just a pricing myth I will not be using gold money or be an affiliate until they rectify this mistake and refund my money But doubt that as I would be relunctant to receive a response from the non existent customer service They only hold your money why should they contact your promptly Also depositing can also be a tedious wait Once again its only your money I ordered gold and silver just to see how the system works and to be honest i do not have much confidence in bitgold GoldMoney Your better off ordering your own physical silver and gold Or use app for rate of cash then when it goes up withdraw and buy physical or bitcoins
DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE
They are cons I have waited since 4th Feb for my item it still hasnt arrived Ive informed that I have moved so I wont receive my item
They refuse to call me by my name or even Miss I am simply customer
They have lied to me saying they have ceased shipping due to the move and then said my product arrived in the UK Yesterday YESTERDAY when my item was meant to be here almost a month ago now
Am now filling with county court after requesting a full refund up to 10 times they are refusing to do so and just fobbing it off to avoid paying me back as it costs more for them to ship back  NOT MY PROBLEM
Two for 24 should never be anything more than 24 You charged me 2498 thieves idiots no wonder Amazon will one day run you into the ground and force you to close

Whilst the show was terrific who knew Ticketmaster would let buyers onsell their tickets at outrageous prices I thought that was scalping We paid 240 for crappy 85 seats
did not receive all the books i ordered
So many reasons  not enough space
Placed an order  was to have shipped in 4 days but never heard anything about shipping after 2 weeks Upon inquiring was told the shoe was backordered till March
Surprise  it shipped in Feb Great But then ONE MONTH LATER  I still hadnt received anything So back to their order page Finally found some obscure page saying the order was returned due to customs What they didnt understand US customs before they shipped the shoes
Oh and to top it off they want to give me a credit on their website so I can order something else ARE YOU KIDDING ME
Now I see they gave me a credit of 800 of the 3900 they charged for shoes that I will NEVER get
And please do not reply to this review LightInTheBox  there is nothing you can say or your worthless customer service can do to make this up to me or the kid that was getting the shoes
The Worst
Sold a package at the door by a rep Completely false to get me to sign up When I rang energia enquiry a few weeks later and told them I hadnt got the offer I was promised They told me oh that offer doesnt apply to you And wouldnt give me the offer I think its such bad form and I still ragging about it Next time he calls il be ready for him What you sign up for is what you should get  And my electricity bill are still the same price I wondering now did I get the cheap rate that he promised Probably not Im a new customer and I will certainly no recommending the to anyone
Bad purchase couldnt open  had to take computer in for repairs to uninstall  remove Should have never bought  told never to trust site

Have since contacted Customs who told me if the package was in BioSecurity that the Courier would have been given notice and they can provide that notice
Now Courier nor PBK will contact me
I am told them I want a refund including the government fees as they have obviously failed to supply the products
I am also going to lodge a PayPal complaint
PBK is the worst company I am spreading the word through my cycling community and Facebook and providing alternative companies for other cyclists to use
When I ordered an item off the website it took almost a week to even be shipped out and isnt supposed to arrive for a month Not sure whats going on there with that but not to happy about it Products seem cool but who knows I havent received it yet and its been 2 weeks
Im a buyer from chrono24  maybe 5 watches per month   I have experience with almost all trusted seller of chrono24 in Europe You can ask me about each of them if you have any questions about them
The owner of this account has lied too many times to me Usually he starts a very friendly  and send you every day some offers by Whatsapp  After you pay it to buy a watch  he ingore his duty and dont send you any watches and usually he will send you after 12 month your money back  But I think recently he doesnt send money back too  Below is my experience
1 one time I paid for a rolex datejust 16233 with saphireglass He didnt send me the watch on time and after 25 days  he send me a rolex datejust 16013 with plexiglass And told me sorry I didnt check the reference number  And start to send me more offer by Whatsaap with really low prices 
2 the second time  I saw in Chrono24 a rolex yachtmaster 16623 with 6450 and I paid it directly to his account but he didnt send the watch and after 16 days he sent back my money 
3 my last experience is  I sent 2375 for a rolex gold band 30 day ago but he didnt send the band until now and it seems he doesnt want to send back my money 
Please be careful This man is a lier and fraud and spam 
Dont trust to this trusted seller 
Even he doesnt have a real shop and its address is a fake address There are a lot of seller in chrono24 like this 
Chrono24 want his benefits not buyer happiness And put every person as a seller or trusted seller 
If I want to write my bad experience with every seller in chrono24 then I should write a book 
During paying for airtickets online some technical issues occured not on my side and payment failed But money has been deducted from my Visa I was trying reach customer support managed to receive response day after I had to buy tickets again but price has increased by 87 EUR
Seems very unfair that due to some technically issues I had to pay this increased amount
ProBikeKon can apologies and be sorry as much as they like  ProBikeKon can claim the product isnt counterfeit or faulty  ProBikeKon can pretend to help me out and accept the goods back 
However the fact still remains I am the consumer that has bought and paid for non genuine not as described product and what ever solution ProbikeKon NOW offer only after posting this review
I as the consumer will still be without the goods and it will cost me money to return the goods for the privilege of what ProBikeKon call a solution  How does that work At this stage all I can suggest to perspective purchases is please be very careful of ProBikeKon If anything changes I will only be to happy to post the outcome
My experience with ProBikeKon would have to be the worst I have ever encountered with any online store  I believe that the product is counterfeit  Fake  Not the real genuine product  With Fake products out of Asia comes the sizing problem that goes along with the cheap product everything is two sizes to small The embroidery badges and logos are already falling off and the product is so small I cant even wear it I am a size Small to Medium frame I ordered a Large It is the equivalent size to an Extra Small  I would need to order an XXLarge in this fake product to fit On top of this I have contacted ProBikeKon several times to discuss an outcome and they have not had the decency to responded  No communication at all to try and resolve the problem I will never use them again with that kind of follow up support or should I say lack of follow up support Buyers beware 
Phenibut hcl did absolutely nothing for me even at 4 times the dose
Purchased A rimless pair of Silhouette glasses Prescription was fine however the drill mounts were not in the same place on each lens So one lens sat higher on the face than the other I have no idea how it could leave the factory like that unless some cross eyed tech assembled them
We were very excited about getting our koozies for our wedding They were expected to come in on the 24th when I received a call on the 23rd from them saying that the Neoprene is out of stock and to look at the photo she sent me The photo was clearly done one cheap foam and she was trying to pass it off as a nicer quality product When I brought that up along with the defects on some of the lettering she changed her story to that the imprint wouldnt stick to the neoprene not that they were out and that I would have to change the design to only have 1 color When i spoke with a supervisor she tried saying production mispoke and refused to help us out When you spend 400 on koozies for your wedding you want them to be quality and not something you can pick up at the bar The supervisor refused to help us and would not let us use 2 colors and that we had to stick to one Customer service definitely lacks with this company DO NOT USE THEM
Travelopod has very poor customer service I made payment for four tickets and has not received tickets Called many times and they are not giving reply in a good way I called many times and they put on hold and disconnecting the phone
My story seems similar to others here After my delivery did not show up in its allotted time I called Marley Spoon I could not get through I left a message on their voicemail I was in a bind with going to work vs food sitting and spoiling in the sun so I wrote them an email and waited as long as I could before heading to work That was Monday It is now Wednesday Our deivery was dropped to a house around the corner on a completely different street and spoiled in the sun Such a waste if they told me it had been delivered I might have searched for it a bit more I have heard nothing from Marley spoon accept a notification that I have been billed another 55 Still waiting and look forward to eventually getting my money back
Stuffed me over big time and then changed me 400 in fees Very rude unhelpful staff Still an ongoing issue with them after 4 weeks
Delivery was longer than a month way too slow I was not even notified about the delay I needed to make an inquiry and ask what is going on to be informed about the delay That is not satisfactory of an online retailer
I would avoid using FloraQueen as I just had my first and last experience with them I ordered 12 deluxe red roses for my girlfriend in Australia so ended up paying 144 which you would expect some amazing roses however the roses were small and looked nothing like on the website the teddy also purchased was damaged when delivered and to top it all off was delivered after office closing hours in which time my girlfriend had finished work I sent numerous questions and had no replies theres no contact number to ring the whole experience was a complete disaster
Everyone is polite and professional except the African American Lady that is the manager She is rude disrespectful very unprofessional
I ordered a couple of items I guess the pony express horse was tired Delivery super slow No help from customer support
My item was sent to wrong address got sent out another item with next day delivery and that not arrived either
The glasses we ordered were so huge they are completely unwearable no amount of adjusting will fix how big they are despite the fact that they are listed with the same sizes except the arm length which we needed a bit longer anyway as a pair that does fit perfectly They are also reported to be a Medium fit frame there is NO WAY these are a medium My husband has a large head according to every optician weve ever talked to and these are HUGE on him They wont even stay on his face They also arrived very dirty and slightly bent This is my fist time ordering from this company and I was shocked and disappointed to read the return policy of NO REFUND on lenses AND a 20 restocking fee on the frame Ive ordered from 2 other online companies before both of whom refunded 100 of my order when needed So on a 208 order I would only receive a refund of 100 When I contacted the company to voice my feelings I was basically told too bad that is the policy Will never order from here again If I cant trust the sizing I have to at least trust the company to make me whole when I am dissatisfied with the product I dont know how they can claim to have a 100 satisfaction guarantee with such awful return policies
Lens Quality very poor not as per expected and high price rate
Terriblefalse advertising
Agent signed us up using wrong address despite my pointing this out to him He insisted the eircode was enough This created catch 22 like situation where nothing could be delivered Had to cancel original contract and start over Never informed us connection to the house would be our cost 800 Have set up appointment for this week but just received a new confirmation for what Ive signed up for which differs from original Nothing has gone right so far
Was offered thebuy 3 get 3 free Was still charged at checkout Called cust service and they did give the money back I got my first box and it contained the wrong candy Called to cancel and I got the annoyingwell will you stay on for this Instead of just letting me cancel I can go but candy a lot cheaper elsewhere
Your web site is horrible to maneuver  everything I wanted you didnt have in my size  in most instance no size available None of the clothes as shown in your commercials were available for purchase  so dont show them Just signing in was horrible  I tried 5 times then went back to your email and got in that way All in All a VERY BAD EXPERIENCE Probably will never return and certainly would not recommend You seem to have some good products so youd better straighten up your act
Very bad customer service pleased order not delivered in time even when you placing order week ahead and instead of make some correction blaming DHL
On my understanding the company should make sure that order deliveredin time
Not happy and Im not recommende this company the wars company with i had to deal
Replying to your you can not guarantee delivery its lay there is no guarantee delivery day
Due to a train crash on our route we were taken back to a previous station and left to find or own way to Brussels No one was helpful and the route suggested to us was an extra 2 hours out of the way Apparently that was the only alternate route given to everyone else because each train departing on that route was packed full of masses of people which didnt feel safe at all and we missed the next two trains because of the overflow of people trying to squish themselves onto a tiny train We spent 6 hours at the Liege train station trying to figure out how to get to our destination No one was apologetic about this and we received no offer for any sort of refund
I reserved a storage unit I packed a car to the top in a rush to get there in time
I showed up No one was around Nobody answered the phone
Nobody told me that the office was NOWHERE near the storage unit
I am highly UNSATISFIED
I went to another storage unti With a gentleman that helped me in the last 5 minutes of his day When he had no time He let me put stuff in and leave it for the night No papers Trusting me
THAT felt good
I do not recomend this storeage unti to anyone unless they want to be ignored
I booked a room after 1 minutes I realized I made a mistake with the month
I contacted Amoma immediately and explained the situation They told me the problem would be solved in 24 h The day after I got an email where I was told the problem would be managed in 30 business days after the period I would be on holiday It seems they havent direct contacts with hotels It works like Chinese boxes and none from customer services cant help you The hotel manager told me they would cancel for free my booking but even this was not sufficient to get back my money I sent everything to The Swiss Ombudsmen office in order to avoid that other people can be caught in this trap
CUSTOMER SERVICE IS UNUSEFUL THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO DEFINE IT BETTER NOT TO BUY THERE
AMOMA 446 pm 15th Feb 2017 modified after your feedback
Already contacted you 10 times without results Its the same to talk to a wall
Ive been wanting to try Fabletics and decided to try after I saw that becoming a VIP member included an Intro Price discount on your first order This is a total lie Everything online will be marked at 50 off the VIP discount but you will not get that price at checkout I am annoyed to say the least What is the point of enrolling in the VIP club if Im not able to get the introductory prices to try items
Horrible quality for the insane price they charge for a hoodie 65 dollars and everything is stamped on not embroydered Will never use this website again
ORDER  2024652168967113
Was welcomed with open arms but couldnt have car I was looking at retrieved from yard with notice not much bargaining as was shut down quite quickly even paying by cash promised things through the sale but received little couldnt even tint the whole car let alone floor mats cars plated 2016 which entitles 4yr 60000km fixed price service but during sale was told its 2017 hence 3yr 45000km without explanation then after sales team has a lot to be desired basically they got there sales and was rudely shown the door leaving feeling ripped off although I love my new car not due to my experience in buying it though very ordinary how about considering the customers needs and wishes instead of thinking  wont recommend motorama
The people are nice and have great service
Buy cartridge from here if you want to pay like 70 cents per page All the other reviews are fake
I purchased iMazing about a year and a half ago It now NO LONGER is supported on my iPhone BUT I havent changed phones I still have the exact phone but since the update with the iOS now IT IS USELESS Customer support will do NOTHING about it Except to tell me to BUY IT AGAIN Thats ridiculous Who knows if itll happen again soon Do we just keep paying every year a new iOS comes out Once a loyal customer that would rave about this product to everyone I cant believe this
There was a dead bug in my hair

stop ripping consumers off
no one responded to my question two days later still waiting
Since the confirmation that theyd taken my money the only communication from Euroflorist has been this request to give them a rating They didnt deliver the flowers They didnt explain why they didnt deliver They didnt acknowledge or respond to the emails I sent to them about this
They dont follow their guidelines or what they say online about shipping and delivery It has taken over 20 days for them to process my order and ship my item It should have been here 4 days ago and they just shipped it
Had new gift cards I wasnt going to use bought on here mailed them in but never received my check for them
I ordered an item on January 30 2017 After they confirmed my order it was stated I would receive a confirmation email regarding the shipment within 2 days After 2 days of NOT receiving one I emailed customer service for them to tell me their system had been down and it would be shipped out that day STILL NO EMAIL So I called and she told me that their was miscommunication and it was not shipped out yet and that it would be that day STILL NO EMAIL So FINALLY a day later I received the email and customer service telling me they would over night the package LIE It took 10 days to get here 10 Today February 16 it says it was delivered and it has not been I have been scammed and do not trust this company and want my money back
Doesnt get any worse than not delivering on Valentines day
I used a kiosk to submit my phone for repair on a Saturday at 2pm which went well I submitted the repair request to have the broken glassscreen repaired I received an email confirming my payment and scheduled pickup time by 1pm on Sunday Later that afternoon I received a call stating the screen repair would be an additional 50 because I mistakenly selected iPhone 6 not iPhone 6s I approved the repairs over the phone Sunday 1pm came and went the phone still was not fixed in fact the phone was not completed and ready for pickup until after 1pm on Monday When I turned on the phone the fingerprint login no longer worked So we called the customer service department manager she called back and informed me that the phone was damaged internally and the cable that controls the fingerprint was damaged and could not be repaired This was Not explained at all during the repair service and Not mentioned until I called to complain I feel like Foxpaw was intentionally deceptive so they would not lose the sale The customer service manager did finally agree to refund the additional 50 charge
Unhappy Customer
Order number 0081748
I attempted to include my logo but its too hard to do You need to be a computer geek to figure out  wasted
Incredibly over priced for the condition they were in not as described
I never received a certificate of completion and Ive been waiting for a month 
The following email that I sent TomTop after receiving my order just within time limit   Now for the Bad news 
Clearly they are sending out Faulty goods that cost more in postage to return from UK than the original cost
Of the order and are relying on people not bothering because they say its the buyers responsibility to pay return cost

Hi Regarding the above order that I received I am very disapointed that it is not working
To be more specific the cameravideo is not working it is not showing a picture from the camera
on the app Videocopter the alert message is that it is  not connected to the video board  or wrong wifi
I have tried 3 Phones and 1 Tablet Obviously the cameras circuit board is at Fault
I believe that I have had a USED FAULTY Item sent when I opened the package I found the Box Damaged
on the bottem   Please Refere to Attached photo  and when I opened the box to assemble the Copter
the Camera was attached to the Copter and not in a White box as it should have beensmall Box missing 
Please look at attached photoes for details of order and box condition with outer packaging 
If this cannot be rectified I will be wanting a complete refund 
I look forward to your reply as soon as possible
Regards
Mike Allanson
The following reply and my response as follows

Hi Friend
In this case we advise to return back to us for checking and repairing
But customers need to cover return shipping cost
Pls inform us so to provide RMA
Regards
Taylor
My response as follows 
Hello Taylor
Thank you for your quick response  But as I pointed out in my email the item that I paid for that was dispatched by yourselves
was clearly faulty and not fit for purpose therefore I am Not responsible for the cost of returning the goods please read the following text 
Returning faulty goods bought online
The Consumer Contracts Regulations are in addition to your other legal rights
So if your goods are faulty and dont do what theyre supposed to or dont match the description given you have the same rights under the Consumer Rights Act as you have when buying face to face
 Any terms and conditions that say you must cover the cost of returning an item Do Not apply where the goods being returned are faulty 
Please take note of the last line  Because the cost of shipping back to China would more than double the original cost of the Copter that I paid for
However A solution may be available to us both may I make a suggestion that
Due to the fact that the problem is with the Camera and its WiFi circuit I would like to suggest that you ship to me a New and Working Camera
This will be a cheaper and less expensive option as it is only a small item and should rectify the problem
I look forward to your reply at your convenience 
Regards

As of today  Friday the 10th of February 2017 I have not had a response and Im not holding my breath after reading so much negativity
Of this alleged Company 
I could not find a dress in a 4xl even tho you have it in your size chart Plus sizes Not so much Very disappointed
We just bought a couch and love seat a month after we had it one of the cushions on the love seat under the fabric is bunching up I contacted American Freight on 1128 and they said send pics and they will send it to the manufacturer I called every week checking on status here we are into February still no answer when I call American to check they either dont call back or tell me still nothing from the manufacturer So I want my money back for the whole set I am done messing with this company the couch I had before the one I bought from American Freight i had for 12 years and it still looked brand new the only reason why i got rid of it is because we moved and our living room was too big for it I am very displeased with American Freight all together their customer service is also crap
I have had to exchange the same order 4 times I ordered an XS and kept receiving XXS Incredibly inconvenient as it has been a month since i placed my first order and i still do not have the leggings i ordered and now they are out of stock
For a company that claims they specialize in Norway they didnt organize our trip well We flew into Oslo on Dec 23rd and stayed in Oslo until the 26th Oslo was completely closed Christmas Eve and Christmas Day They should have recommended that we fly directly to Tromso as the tours there all run over the holiday Then we went to kirkeness to stay at the snow hotel and go king crab fishing They scheduled our king crab fishing the evening we arrived however upon arrival we were told that included with the cost of our room in the snow hotel was a gourmet meal that we would miss because of the tour We asked if we could reschedule our tour for the next morning being that the flights they scheduled for us were not until 830 pm and we had nothing scheduled but it was fully booked So we missed the dinner and spent the entire next day hanging around the lounge in the hotel We wanted to stay in a snow room at the hotel but no one explained to us that they kick you out of the room at 7 am We probably would have opted to not stay there had we known that fact The trip was sadly poorly organized to maximize our time there There must be a tour company that knows Norway better then them
I recently ordered a few frames and tried to be self sufficient by placing my order online I couldnt figure out the site and ultimately picked up the phone This was just as irritating
Ive been framing for over 25 yrs I cut my own mats I understand how to measure a piece of artwork for get the frame measurement
Long story short one frame came a random 12 x 24 instead of a standard size 20 x 24 frame  which I pointed out to the agent as being a standard size Nothing complicated
It was explained to me that the order was read back at the end of the call making it ultimately my errornot theirs
I use this company because its economical and efficient I cant afford restock fees and return shipping charges I dont have time to mess around trying to navigate their website I feel that I cant afford to not find a different framing company to buy my frames from
Disappointed

Had booked a ticket for my parents and they had said that it was charged in splits but it was split in thrice  no overcharge though but 2 charges of 1150 clearly state the airlines name but remaining 207 says charged by Travelopod inc I suspect that they are charging as a commision Even though I agree that I had accepted for 1250X2 due to availability circumstances 207 is what if they had taken a commision then its really bad Not booking through any agents from the next time
Numerous issues with a recent order 1 Did not received a confirmation email Had to check my credit card statement to confirm the transaction was completed 2 Order was out of stock and backordered Did not receive any notification of this After waiting 2 weeks and not receiving any info I initiated contact with Dyers via their Chat feature Company rep informed me that the item wasnt expected to be shipped for another 24 weeks 3 My credit card was charged immediately when I placed the order Whenever this occur with ANY order the purchase WAS NOT CHARGED until shipped 4 In any other purchase that I have made through any other merchandiser I have always been given the option to wait for availability or to cancel In the past I have made a few other purchases from Dyers and I was completely satisfied Unfortunately this transaction was very disappointing and will make me think twice before making a purchase
Very difficult to speak to someone Have posted call back request but I am in work and I do not hear from them again Messaging service has similar issues

I ordered and paid for two premiership football tickets for my fellas birthday over 3 weeks ago The tickets arrived only hours before the game leaving us with a panic to get there in time and having to cancel our hotel for the previous night Even though they were guaranteed 48 hours before
Then we get to the stadium and our tickets DONT WORK They are from a tout and we were refused entry after spending 170 on them We then had to buy new tickets at great expense to get into the game
Have ticketbis replied to my emails Of course not Will I get my money refunded I doubt it
The worst thing the ticket office at the football club said that ticketbis are well known for selling these shady tickets How are they able to get away with this
Disgraceful
I would never recommend anyone Zero value for your money and time
No I wouldnt use your service nor would every refer anyone you simply dont keep promises I was given so many false promises regarding the transfer I would have appreciated if I were given a right information Even though the processing was delayed I would have been happy to have realistic and honest response However 7 times from 7 different people I was given false statements and different delivery dates Which in itself shows the flaw and dishonesty to clients time and shows zero respect to clients trust
you have your product name printed on my pouch
Im supposed to advertise for my product not for your website
Ridiculous went to kinsale store for click  collect and was told to go to little island depot Why is this option available if i cannot collect from store of choice I should have been sent direct depot
Product itself is good Instructions to assemble needs to be clear to save time for those doing it the first time Instructions that came with the product had complicated pictures with little to no description I called support and they sent me instructions that were too wordy and without clear pictures
My suggestion would be to break instructions into several steps with clear pictures and descriptions

On January 30 2017 I placed an online order for a television set from Best Buy Canada The purchase was sent by Purolator tracking number 330964321153 It was the first time anyone sent me anything by Purolator
On February 07 Purolators website promised delivery of the package that day At 251 pm the website announced Delayed in transit and that they will make another attempt the next day It is important to note that I received a FedEx delivery that day Purolator cannot site inclement weather as an excuse
On February 08 Purolators website said the parcel was on the delivery track and that it was on its way At 239 pm the website declared Delayed in transit and that they will make another attempt the next day February 08 was a beautiful day
On February 09 today the website once again said Delayed in transit and that they will make another attempt the next day Does this begin to sound like the movie The Groundhog Day Incidentally February 09 was a mild and sunny day in Calgary with no snowfall in sight
In summary Purolator is a third world company operating in the first world and I dont know why an established business like Best Buy would deal with this carrier
I ordered a pair of Altra Lone Peak 30 Polartec shoes in mid December using my PayPal account as a Christmas gift and was insured they would arrive in time for the big day Well that did not happen When i realized the shoes would not arrive in time I attempted to cancel my order I was told by the customer service rep that since they drop ship directly from the manufacturer they would not be able to cancel the order Because I knew all about the pair shoes I did not need to read the details and the description of the shoes Nowhere on the main order screen did it say they were drop shipped from Altra when I brought this to the customer service reps attention she agreed that this was almost bait and switch Roadrunner Sports needs to clearly label on the main order screen that the products that are drop shipped are indeed drop ship and not directly from themselves Thank God for Altra as I contacted them immediately and they ensured that a pair of shoes would arrive in time However this did cost me an additional pair of shoes as a separate order directly from them When I received the pair of shoes from Road Runner Sports I decided to exchange them Using their return policy I sent the shoes out Friday December 30th When I discovered that Roadrunner had receive them and had had them for a few days I again called customer service It was then I was told I would not be getting an exchange pair of shoes because I had used PayPal and that I would be getting a credit Again no where on the immediate page does it state that if you use a PayPal account and need to do an exchange they would not on an exchange they would only credit up Paypal account Even as I talk to the customer service representative I offered to pay the difference which I believe was about 10 to have the shoes exchanged and they would not be able to do that Long story short as of January 24th I still have not received my credit Their website and customer service informs me it can take up to 14 business days to do this credit This seems quite farfetched as when I paid for the merchandise it was immediately deducted from my credit card I do not give poor ratings two companies unless they deserve it and in this situation this company deserves this one star rating The customer service Representatives that I talk to were very indifferent to my situation and offered me absolutely no alternative Do yourself a favor and never order shoes from this company At least in this situation my ordering experience through Ultra directly was incredibly favorable Theyre customer service went above and beyond when I contacted them just three days before Christmas I had the shoes on Christmas Eve and they provided a pair of compression socks as compensation That was a 40 set of socks And they matched roadrunners price Roadrunner Sports will never received my business again and I will do everything I can to discourage anyone from ordering from them

Once were at the airline checkin we were informed thar the tickets were canceled
After requesting for more information at the airline help desk at the airport we were informed that Opodo requested the cancelation
We are still waiting to understand the reason and how can this be possible
I think many of the reviews for Ooma arent legitimate The call quality is actually soso with lots of international problems
The customer service is terrible and sales will call you everyday for the rest of your life

I had an issue with Vacation Rental Pros last Sept 2016 and it still hasnt been settled  Numerous calls emails and even a hand written letter Not impressed
DO NOT TRUST THIS SITE Sent 2 cards in for payment and a week and a half later I received an email stating they were received and payment was posted to my PayPal account Great thanks However when I checked my PayPal account there was no balance no activity from CK Contacted customer service twice asking to verify the PayPal email address they used because I never actually received payment I have not heard back from them either time Working on my next step to get my money or cards back with absolutely NO assistance from Card Kangaroo I should have known better lesson learned DO NOT TRUST THIS SITE
UPDATEIt took 2 emails and a bad review to get someone to respond to my questionexcellent customer service I will note however that the phone call DID answer my question and I was finally able to work out the problem with PayPal
I have to send back the parcel as ecco mixed up the articles and sent me another model and size Looks like there is chaos in the delivery department of ecco

I shipped a puppy with Shane from Citizen Shipper Shane was highly recommended to us by the management after the first two drivers contracted with failed to show for pickup I was sending a puppy from Ohio to Arizona Shane seemed to be very responsible and caring NOT instead of taking the puppy to its destination he took the pup to his home Every day we tried contacting him and finally after 13 days we had to get the police involved Citizen Shipper did try to talk to him and offered to send someone for the pup but Shane refused and demanded full payment for a pup he did not deliver and threatened to either keep the pup or sell it Good thing the pup was micro chipped and registered Only after police were involved did Shane take the pup to its destination I dont really fault Citizen Shipper but they do need to be more thorough with their hiring practices Be very careful shipping pets of any kind and never send an unregistered and microchipped pet I will never use these folks again as I had a bad experience with not one but three drivers And be very wary of Shane its not safe to ship even a pet rock with him

I ordered my prescription medication online from Ontario to Edmonton I order this medication frequently on a monthly basis Since beginning this treatment and having medication delivered the company that I go through chooses to use Purolator as their delivery option Every single time I choose one day delivery and it ends up taking Purolator 3 to 5 business days from leaving the facility in Ontario to make it to Edmonton One time Purolator lost my package delivered it to the wrong address and refused to take responsibility for the package leaving me out of 200 It didnt matter who I spoke to about the incident nobody seem to care and I was left without my prescription and out 200 Every time I call Purolator and speak to a customer service representative all I get in return is attitude poor service and frustration It doesnt matter who I speak to you I feel undervalued as a customer and unappreciated I have asked my provider if there is another delivery company that I could use and unfortunately the only one that they choose to use is Purolator despite my continuous calls of complaint about Purolator Because of Purolator I will be switching producers and its unfortunate that I must change my means of medication and they must lose a customer based on the actions and service of a wellknown and reputable company such as Purolator It is ridiculous and uncalled for If I had an option to give them less than one star I totally would Shame on you Purolator

Terrible customer service experience Ordered a gift for my in laws that live in NY on my credit card Im from Toronto They charged me and sent me the confirmation 3 days later they cancel my order without even confirming with me After they took my money
Tried calling them asked when they cancelled they said something about fraudulent activity and how they can cancel any orders they want No apologies no nothing In fact their reps were very rude and didnt care at all I lost money on the exchange rate and my time trying to uncancel the order Didnt get my gift in time for my in laws either Huge dissapointment and probably the worst customer service experience

Not much documentation is available for some of the products
The Joystick for the Pan Tilt Zoom has no manual with it all There are lots of user defined buttons and no way to figure out how to use them
The DVR is good when it comes to an on line manual Tech support was very willing to tell me over the phone how to run the equipment not much help if you have a problem at 3 AM Good quality on the hardware but I would rate the post support F

Through your add on instagram I tried to use my phone to order the items and was not able to The site told me multiple times that there were fields that were not filled in correctly though when I went on my laptop I was able to order without a problem
I placed this order on 112816 It was delivered on 1917 Thats over 7 weeks from order to receipt of order All contact for status updates were initiated by me I felt like I was imposing on the customer service department every time I wanted to get an order update Sometimes the customer service person was downright rude If I was selling a product that I couldnt deliver in a reasonable amount of time yet I charged for the product from day oneI would make damn sure I updated the customer and went above and beyond to make things right 7 weeks Come on
Horrible experience first off let me say this when a customer is trying to purchase something online there should be a way you can talk to a live customer service representative not some automated bs With that being said I purchased 2 items assuming they were the right parts for my vechicle since I typed them in on their search engine Turns out both parts were wrong So on top of me paying high  shipping they telling me through email that if I return the items it would be deducted from what I paid bs Had spoken with someone before I confirmed my purchase none of this wouldve never happened Oh btw the website wouldnt even let me use my 10 coupon Im telling every person thinking about using them think twice Rip offs
I have made a few purchases with Pure Formulas in part because of promotions they promised They never paid referral credits and dont respond to questions about it

Cars are over priced dont get cheaper on extended rentals customer service arent very in depth all in all would just rather go to a bigger name hire company
I was so happy when I found such a good price for shipping to Europe I paid about 120 for 30 lbs package It was delivered very quickly which was not my priority at all and then there was bad news  a recipient had to pay 200 euros additionally I was put in a very delicate situation because of that and was extremely disappointed that I was not notified that taxescustom fees would be that much money If I was provided the correct information from the beginning I would simply not use this service at all a representative didnt offer any acceptable solution but just kept apologizing which obviously didnt change anything in the situation I overpaid where I wanted to save money Of course I wont be using this company again
I got a response from ParcelMonkey stating that all additional fees were not their responsibility they warned me about upcoming fees so they cant be blamed
And again I am providing an honest customer feedback instead of stating how smart you are that you warned me please take this review into consideration do your research about upcoming fees for customers and let customers know about how much of their hard earned money they will need to pay more
Difficult to give meter readings
Email to give a reading arrives the day before a bill is issued
I ordered a coat from this company I checked the size chart very carefully and ordered a small When it arrived it was way too big  much bigger than it should be if it would follow the size chart
The worst part is I sent the item back and they promised me I would get the money back  for the transport also
I have not yet recieved the money They keep telling me to contact them via Paypal and I did  but still no money
This is my worst experience with online shopping so far
I keep receiving adverts from this company Bader at my home in Luxembourg and one day on 3 January I decided to order 3 small items from them just to see how it went After a week I had still received nothing so I emailed them to ask when my order would be arriving I was told it normally takes ten days to Luxembourg 10 days I am next door to Germany not in Australia
After ten days the package finally arrived and I was very excited to open it untilI discovered something was wrong Two of the items I had ordered were in the package but another item was missing as was the Geschenk present they had promised me on the front of their advert Instead of a lovely black swimsuit Badeanzug I had ordered I found a huge white bra about ten sizes bigger than my size which I had not ordered at all
I did the correct thing and IMMEDIATELY wrote them an email in English  my written German is not good enough to explain the situation in detail telling them exactly what I had found in the package even giving them the brand name and code number of the item sent to me by mistake I never actually received a reply to that email So thinking that maybe they didnt understand English two days later 16th January I called their Customer Service centre where I found a lady who spoke perfect French So I told her in French of the problem and asked her to please send me the swimsuit as soon as possible as I needed it to go on holiday She agreed to send it immediately but asked me to return to her by post the white bra which had been sent to me by mistake she did not apologise for their mistake however I am a very busy working person but I did what she asked  on 17th January I went to the post office after having bought a large envelope inserted the white bra in the envelope with a letter in French  AGAIN explaining the situation  and stuck the Bader return sticker on the package I patiently waited ANOTHER TEN DAYS and nothing arrived So again I sent emails to complain and said this time I am tired of waiting and would just like my money back immediately But I was so irritated that I decided to call them the following day too and spoke to the same Frenchspeaking lady asking her why she had not sent me the swimsuit which I had paid for online by credit card 3 weeks earlier She told me she had not sent it because it was not in stock at the time but it had miraculously just arrived and she had just posted it yesterday after receiving my email asking for my money back of course I do not believe her She could have emailed me immediately to tell me that it was no longer in stock but she didnt She just left me waiting for the postman to arrive every single day for another 10 days I think she probably just forgot Or they were waiting to receive that horrible white bra back from me first Their internal mailing and administrative procedures appear to be so slow that a snail would move more quickly from Luxembourg to Germany and viceversa It must simply be an excuse to hold on to my money for longer However it is certainly no way to treat customers Dear Bader if a customer informs you of a mistake as soon as heshe receives a package from you you should believe them and try to make amends not make the customer wait forever and keep them uninformed about the status of their order If a customer tells you that something was missing from a package because of the fault of somebody working for YOUR companyand that she would like to have that article immediately you should a apologise for the mistake and b send the article IMMEDIATELY with a small gift to apologise for the mistake That is how you do business and keep customers This was my first time with this company and it will definitely be the last I have never had such awful customer service in my life I often order from websites in England and never have any problems there They are always very efficient It is a pity because there are some very interesting things in the catalogue but I just dont trust you any more And Im still waiting for my money back
Bought a ticket from Bravofly and got no receipt automatically When I call their customer service I am told that it takes 14 days for them to see the receipt I call arter 14 days and receipt will then be emailed to me no receipt comes and then ring after 3 more days of each other Technical problems are blamed on each time I still occupy received a receipt It is so terribly bad service I have never been seen anything like this before Like I said I have still not received an receiptinvoce
You would expect any florist with an ounce of sense wouldnt leave flowers on a front porch in 35 degree weather All I got when I complained was an apology and an email stating we are committed to quality and service For the  I spent I expected better service Do not order from this florist
I found out a few days before the original ship date that I was given had been changed by almost a month with no notification or email I now have less than a week to find a dress  for a coronation ball that I was meeting my New husband College friends and fraternity Brothers for the first time  I had to send 7 emails before anyone responded back to me I do not recommend this company or their business practices for any event that is important to you This experience has left me highly disappointed  frustrated and sad I never write reviews but found it important to do so because I trusted this company with an important event that I should not have 
Im very upset and worried about my shipment and the unjustified reasons for delay My parcel  U20170110725829 is delayed for 4 days now under status paid and still not delivered to DHL for shipment Customer service is not available at all during the mentioned working timeonline chat is not available there is no way that I can get someone to give me any justification or update of the status of my shipment
Im really very very upset
Although I have been using their service multiple time for the last year with no problems but when I faced this problem because of whatever reason I discovered that there is no way of getting a normal customer service communication
I ordered refills and waited weeks with no notice of shipment nor delay or out of stock notice I emailed and they acknowledged no communication and advised me of being out of stock on the refills and referred me to the parker refill options Since I am really hung up on Visconti refills I was going to wait a little longer I was billed on my credit card and decided to opt for the fisher space pen refills just to get this transaction completed I asked to be notified if they are able to get the Visconti refills in the future I did receive the fisher refills very promptly but expressed that I can get them at the local office supply store and dont need to buy them online
I do think had I not contacted them I may still be waiting almost three weeks I advised that their website reflect out of stock items so they dont disappoint others I will see if they ever notify me of the arrival of Visconti refills
Had to return these boots 2 times so far hopefully the 3rd try is the charm Not a good 1st impression as this was my first order

How many people experienced this with Envato 
You buy something which is not working they investigate as they said you send screenshots and login info to check the product is not working 
What they do  NOTHING 
Ok  Its over 2 months now i paid to Enavato something not working and today what i have  no product no money refund 
Can i say Envato has no professional attittude 
Can i say Envato is dishonest 
Judge by yourself and avoid this unprofessional company 
Never received my order and company stop responding to my email complaints Never got refund for the order niI never received
Honestly every time I try to get something other than BLACK its out of stock The VIP rewards program is VERY confusing and cannot figure out exactly how it works despite spending a half hour looking for a button on two occasions
This online store is the worst Ive ever shopped at It takes 3 business days for them to ship a 10 order One order I had with them got delivered by the mailman in my front door and got stolen and they had me dealt with the post office by myself and no offer of support what so ever Would not recommend this online store with anyone  unless you got enemy
Your booking interface put me back to start three times or gave me higher rates than I intended to book
All items are no longer available a month later I received this message Money is left for next buying 
but I want my money back I do not have a good experience And hope they will still be honest Lets not take months to pay back the money in my account A moment and speak to an ombuds But know  Never again 
I ordered tickets over 1200euro they were lost in the process and no action was taken in time for me to retrieve the tickets for the game

Ordered flowers for Valentines Day added a very nice love card and an exclusive vase to make it perfect for my girlfriend for an additional 18 euros When I saw what she received I got really upset She got a cheap vase and a printed piece of a paper in the envelope The worst was yet to come Contacted support and told the what was going on Then a guy calls from Spain to my girlfriend being being very rude asking about if what she got and so on He didnt even bother to call me I ordered not her I send another message to the support and didnt hear anything from them Got a email today saying my ticket is closed and they are not going to do anything about it Im very disappointed at this company and would never recommend anyone to hire them when they treat their costumers like this 
I just went to place an order and changed my mind as soon as I put in my credit card info Instead of proceeding to the next screen or clicking submit I then deleted out my credit card info and the item from my cart which then showed that my cart was empty I then received an order confirmation email I did a live chat with the company right away and they state that they cant cancel my order and I dont know how to checkout and I had to have clicked on submit I definitely did not this means they save your credit card info Beware if you even key in your credit card  the order will get recognized and submitted Very sketchy practices and unhelpful and rude service
I booked a flight with Flighthub to Hawaii My original flight was changed without anyone contacting me from Flighthub or the airline which would have made it impossible for me to catch my connecting flight also booked through Flighthub with the same airline I only noticed because I went to book another flight and saw the mix up Flighthub told me this was the airlines mistake Fine
The day before I was to leave I went to checkin on my flight and could not do so The airline said that when I rebooked my flight the travel agency never reissued my ticket so I would have to call Flighthub and get them to reissue the ticket and then I could checkin
When I called Flighthub the customer service rep told me just to go and checkin at the airport 3 hours before my flight When I insisted that the problem be figured out now she disappeared from the phone line without saying anything then after a long wait she comes back and says she can get me a flight on a different day with no explanation as to why I could no longer be on the original flight After pushing this further and having her disappear on me a couple more times I told her I wanted a refund and I would book the flight myself She then tells me the refund will be for 520 When I asked where that amount came from she disappeared again and then came back and said ok Im ready to issue the refund for 520 not answering my question I pushed further and asked to speak to a manager but was told she was the only one there Finally she explained that the seat assignment fee and cancellation insurance is nonrefundable This is fine but it took me asking several times to get an answer Its been over a week and I still dont have the refund in my account
I then went on and booked myself the exact same flight to Hawaii that I was supposed to be on except with a 2 hour layover in San Fran instead of a 55 hour one
I am never booking through Flighthub again I have used them in the past and things have been fine but clearly their customer service is lacking
Update called because it has been almost two weeks with no refund and was told it would take 68 WEEKS to process When I asked for something in writing like an email to confirm the refund was coming they refused DONT BUY THROUGH FLIGHTHUB
The reviews are so bad for goldcar I did not pick up the car I had paid and booked in Lanzarote I took the hit on the money I paid and booked with another company So glad I did My booking was none refundable not sure why but tried to get it refunded with no success Thinking I will go through visa to reclaim my money as it all seems dodgy and fraudulent

I bought what I considered to be both a lock and a chain The product was displayed as providing both a lock and a chain and I thought it represented good value I paid the money and the parcel duly arrived only to contain a chain I complained that they had advertised both a lock and a chain They pointed me to another page advertising just a lock with a price of over 8000 I consider the product to have been mis sold and am currently pursuing this company with UK Trading Standards Ive attached the advert so anyone can make their own minds up Even the Oxford card on the advert states Chain and lock After my latest email about this Im being told that if I want to return the chain I will have to pay for any delivery costs Not a good way to treat a previously loyal customer I will never use this company again and will do my very best to let as many people know as possible about the way they do business DISGRACE

The wine and cheese hamper was as described and dispatched within a reasonable time but the courier Star Track attempted unsuccessfully to deliver and didnt leave a card so it went to the post office It sat there until
after venting my spleen in a phone call to them that they must have gone back and left a card and it was eventually picked up by the recipient By then both cheeses had expired THIS IS NOT WHAT I WANTED
Never again 
I had nothing but trouble trying to complete this transaction My cards was declined a number of times and when I spoke with my bank they said that DH Gate never submitted a request for payment and that there was something wrong with their system This went on for over a week with numerous cards Finally I got it worked out on my own but trying to talk to someone other than their computer was also a challenge I love the vendors hate the system I am going to have to find another way to do my business I think
Not so great coverage calls were broken up
I ordered three items three weeks ago and so far only one item has been delivered I have received no information on the status of my other purchases
Mat board was creased on one side Dont know if it was shipped damaged

Apple had dominated the BusinessPersonal tech consumer market since the 1980s with the launch of Apple1 Since then it had gained popularity  but with the arrival of Windows by Microsoft and IBMs along with Compaq HP Dell and other players in the market it had some where lost its shine But with the launch of iPhone it came in the market like a shining Sun of early morning that glows everything around it But I think Apple Inc wasnt able to continue with the innovation thirst of the techies all over the world and has lost its ground in front of Chinese makers and also from some competitors like Google Inc
On opening box with first impression of the selfie drone was cheap as to be expected for the price I paid and fortunately the drone would not switch on it would not charge and could not get a reply from Tomtop
I managed to progress through the midpoint of the course but I was brought back to the very beginning of the course because I failed the voice authentication process When I called customer service for technical support neither one of the employees who answered the call were helpful They both claimed that they were not able to assist me which is a lie It was so upsetting because I spent my Saturday afternoon managing through this course and just because the system randomly could not validate my voice through the voice tester I had to return to the very beginning of the program which does not make any sense I paid for this course thinking that it would be more convenient than going to an actual classroombased class but this course particularly I Drive Safely online course has been a headache and a waste of time and money I would not recommend this companys course to anyone The customer support team could have been way more helpful on this experience than the little that they did or did not do
The promised 24 hour response to the Customer Service is now many days overdue
The item was supposed to be night vision low light vision It is not easy to see through it even in daylight and the labeling clearly states that it is a plain monocular telescope
My total lack of trust will remain and result in adverse discussions about the firm and clearly there will be no future purchases unless some rapid action is taken with appropriate compensation for the inconvenience
I am not optimistic
I ordered a part with 2nd day air shipping If it had shipped that day or the next I would have gotten it on time When it didnt arrive by the day I needed it I called Transcat The person who took my call was very polite and helpful and assured me it would be shipping the following Monday When it still hadnt arrived three days later I called again Again a pleasant enough experience and the rep had to look into it and called me back which he actually did They said they had just gotten the part in that day and it would be shipping later that day I called the next day and they said that they had just shipped it out that morning not the day before as I was told When it finally arrived it was almost three weeks later than when I needed it Despite the polite representatives I was given a runaround time and time again and wound up with an angry customer
Wo ist der Rest
I tried twice to order something and it wouldnt update my credit card information and now the item is gone Not good customer service when I called the first time
Will never buy from Wiggle again and will tell my friends to boycott as well
Items not delivered and even after two lodgement of complaints and even online chat with a customer service representative still have no outcome No response provided
Went in to buy stuff they had in stock I spent nearly 4000 in the store minus delivery separate charges when i asked about pick up they told me it will be all ready for pick up next day I rented a u haul for the day of pick up only to find out some of the stuff i bought the day before was sold to another customer when i asked when would the other items be available they lied to me and said the next day they have another delivery of stock coming in they also told me they would deliver it to my home for free just for having a bad experience with my purchase 2 weeks went by and still missing my items well worth 700  Finally i got tired of being lied to and called in to speak to a manager which told me they still dont have my items furious i calmly told manager to refund me for the items  As i waited on hold he came back to tell me the computer was marking the inventory wrong and they had it all along really This sounded fishy to me all of my items suddenly turn up when i demanded a refund watch out with this store not to mention they are pricey and didnt even make a attempt to offer me compensation for my trouble NEVER buyin here again Made 2 trips total of 180 min from home and a total of 175 in uhaul rentals all HQ had to say was we will look into it to make sure this doesnt happen in the future
My foundation came broken and no help at all
Never inspect the car with the customer before hand over to him
Always argue when the customer returns the car
Me and my 3 friends found Bravofly on Momondo We look for tickets to Sri Lanka The price were DKK 5200 But we got charges DKK 5500 each when the payment went through
And why do you have to be charged money to call the servicecenter hvem you call them in their opening hours
They promised 14 day delivery I ordered books on vacation After a month they still had not arrived Went back home and got an email asking how much I liked the books I spoke to their customer service twice and each time was told the order was cancelled Today well over a month after the order was submitted I got an email asking how I liked the book
Expect orders to take a very long time forever
I place an order on the 1st January which stated it would be delivered within 24 working days I hadnt received the product by the 11th January so I decided to cancel the order I was told a refund would take 35 working days yet I still have received no refund and I have had to open a PayPal claim
They cannot provide me with the products I ordered and also cant seem to process a refund Customer services are terrible no help at all in helping me get my problem resolved
Avoid this company
I have ordered converse  the delivery was going to take next working day if you order before 7 oclock but it has came 2 days after also i have ordered size 5 and when the shoes arrived they were to big and they have fit a size 6 and a half very disappointed
This service is appalling it drops out frequently and I have not been satisfied since it was installed
Bad terrible ans useless wepportal

Paid for overnight shipping an attempted delivery was made no knock no nothing
So now because the truck is going to be late getting back to the depot i have to wait to pick the package up on Monday
Fantastic service
Not to mention the two initial women i got on the phone at their customer service department need some training lets put it that way
I paid the 7 for expedited shipping After it hadnt shown up by the latest date estimated I had to email the seller which then prompted them to ship it out I finally received it a week later
I recently ordered a p40 Tiger Shark and a pt109 pt boat plastic models both came broken it also took two weeks to get here Its not worth it to send them back Ill go back to getting my models from my local hobby stores I will never order from here again
I ordered a dozen roses a small box of chocolates and a balloon for my girlfriend who is a teacher at a school for blind children this past Valentines day I also ordered a 16 piece box of chocolate for her students not wanting to leave them out my girlfriend received some flowers the day after without the vase that was to be included and without the chocolates I ordered for the her students I tried many times to make contact an no one will return my inquirys
these people should be ashamed or at the minimum be embarrassed but after reading other reviews I see it is their normal way of doing business I will never recommend these incompetent people to anyone I wouldnt trust them to deliver a single blade of grass our loved ones or special occasions are too important to be trusted to these lowlife thieves
RON
Whats the point of having rubber mats without a rim to stop water draining off Customer services totally unhelpful  I have to pay return postage and they will deduct 5 from the refund
Why is My order is always feg 
I wanted to use my AARP membership for a discount but your site billed my credit card immediately upon my online reservation
No email to let me know that there was going to be a delay in delivery Finally received item after 2 months which I had to choose another colour as originally one wasnt available
When I came to your store in Colony the table had a ticket that said 54900 Has the wood gone exotic or extinct
Majority of mens items are low stock or not available
received yesterday my bike from starbikelivorno  specialized sworks epic the saddle had a big crack and cannot be used starbike blocked me on messenger after the claim value of saddle is 27900 eur so want to warn people to do business with this company
i bought a vape from them and it did not charge and also was told i need to wait a week to see if they will approve refundreordering or send another unit so now i have a broken unit that i emailed pictures of when i first opened box and they still told me to wait for approval
I havent received it yet They said that it would take 57 business days and its been two weeks Hopefully I get it soon And if its as amazing as the picture Ill be able to do an accurate review
I had arrived at work this morning before the message arrived with the delivery time of my parcel It was after 930  giving me a delivery slot if 1147  1247  I rang my husband at home and he was waiting for the delivery  This is a large Victorian house he was upstairs at the time when there was a ring on the bell By the time he got to the front door  there was a non delivery slip pushed through the letter box The driver could not have waited  I have re scheduled the delivery for tomorrow and will place a note on the door asking the driver to ring and knock and wait 
Got my KW88 3 days ago but it was faulty Watch started up and turned off in about 10mins Thereafter cannot charge and turn back on again
Filed a ticket Ticket number 79201E3D5801475386E65112467C00CC 
No updates till now Whats the point of fast delivery but when item is faulty reply doesnt come as fast
Very disappointed looking at the dead US110 watch now everyday waiting for an answer from DX
Every chat with Claudia from Customer Service will give you the same reply wait for a few more days Ive seen people here waited for a month and still no reply
So could I get a answer for my faulty purchase please Thank you
Otherwise I think I might filed a dispute with paypal and cancel the order
Used in Barcelona Paid 10 per day for satnav that did not work and did nothing when we returned it A con with petrol and extra charge on card when we returned
never ever use again

Based on my recent experience with Galaxy Medical Alert Systems I will never again use their products or services
I contacted Galaxy when it was time to return a monitoring system that I thought had come from them After a pleasant conversation with Chris and after he said he checked our name in his files he advised me to do so
I sent it by express post with a tracking  for 2185 The next day Roy left me a message saying he had received a package sent in error by me because it contained another companys product
Puzzled I called and spoke with Chris who confirmed that he had made a mistake when he told me to send it to them He said this kind of thing has happened before because there are a number of companies with similar names and products I agreed and reminded him that that was why I had phoned him in the first place In this case Chris said that when he checked our name he mistakenly confused it with another customer and would return the unit to me
A week later I received a call from Roy asking why I had not followed up on the voice message he had left me and advising that he still had the unit I said that I had indeed followed up spoken with Chris and had been wondering why it had not yet been returned to me To my surprise Roy said he would send it back COD I said that I was certain that sending it back COD was not what Chris had planned to do given the mistake was his Roy argued that I had returned the unit to their company in error I agreed that I had done so but only because Chris had directed me to Roy said he would check with Chris and call me back The next day instead of receiving a phone call the unit arrived at my door at the cost of 1688 COD
I was stunned In the course of moving my father into longterm care I was in contact with numerous health and support services banks cable and telephone companies etc Each and every individual I spoke with treated me with courtesy and care An emotionally difficult task was made a little lighter and I was grateful for this Every interaction was professional and efficientuntil I had the misfortune of contacting Galaxy Medical Alert Systems Their poor customer service and extensive miscommunication is unacceptable Now 5318 later the unit is on its way to the correct location
I purchased Reline It denture reliner and was sent 4 powders and 1 liquid so I called the maker of this and was told it should have had 2 powders and 2 liquids so the company sent me a new kit free of charge which was nice but I had to wait another week for it to arrive
Sono dei ladri schifosi Diffidate e NON COMPRATE MAI DA LORO
Jamais livre le bouquet
It says it was on the truck for delivery at 820am Its currently 308pm and still waiting for my package This company is such a joke
The online experience was fine but when we got there to pick up our car they did not have one available and told us wed have to wait at least 15 hours and it was already 1100 pm and we had a 3 hour drive ahead of us We ended up going to a different place to rent and didnt get as good of a price because we did it in person instead of online
The parts I received had dirty grease on them had obviously been opened and stapled closed again These were USED parts and not labeled as such I filled out a return which it appears they expect me to do at my expense Really That is NOT acceptable
Does not make sense why the intro prices are shown but then in the cart they are double the price I would have purchased why more items but due to the misleading prices I did not purchase everything I wanted
No manufacture date shown on tyres
 I thought that was illegal in Australia
Manufacture dates MUST be stamped shown on Types
Poor communication  service from fitment centre
Goodyear tyres  Hasnt helped fuel economy 
Traction not as good as tyres they replaced Thats NOT GOOD
The sideboard is advertised as handmade and has you thinking some old world craftsman has slaved over it for weeks just for you In reality there is a big made in China sticker on the back of it  Ive never had so many emails and phone calls in my life to discuss the delivery of anything They company insisted that I could arrange a date that was convient for me Not true at all The delivery company makes 2 deliveries a month in this direction and insisted on delivering this long awaited sideboard Christmas Eve I had over 30 people coming to my house that day and said that will not work Well then youll have to be put on hold and wait until it is convenient for us to deliver to you during our twice a month delivery Which then became January The piece was paid for and ordered in October mind you I was told the delivery men were to bring the piece in and set it where I wanted and unwrap it They came in dumped it and left It took my husband and I to unbox and unwrap the item together Then we found the made in China sticker My husband was upset I had spent nearly 600 on this item that was obviously not the quality I had expected Needless to say I will not be ordering from this company again Live and learn
Ive paid 133 euros for a ticket between Liverpool and Tottenham They told me they shipping the tickets to my house but Im really worry because there are a lot of comments of bad experiences They tell me I have restrict view What does it mean Thanks
The lifetime warranty is of little value The cord lock on one of our blinds failed and because they no longer deal with the company that made the blinds SN refuses to repair it Their warranty policy is to give you 100 of the original cost of the blind if you replace the entire thing through them So basically youre stuck paying whatever overage they want to charge you for the new blind To make matters worse there are two blinds in this room So if I still want them to match I have to replace the 2nd one as well For the 2nd one I was offered half of the original price Again Id be stuck paying whatever they choose to charge over what I originally paid These were expensive blinds
I located the exact same cord lock on Amazon for 17 So my choices are to spend hundreds of dollars to replace the blinds using the SN warranty or 17 and fix it myself Not much of a choice and not much of a warranty
Remember people pay for this facility
Points of concern are as follows
1 Dirty showers 
2 broken  faulty machines  weeks 
3 Saff members who have a seriously negative arritude 
4 staff who have zero interest in communication with members while in gym to advise 
Awful people out of country even charges per agent awful service books u a flight u dont even want then takes days to remove JUST DONT DO IT
I do a lot of traveling and I have booked with different on line agencies and non but Flighthub was the worst I have been searching for tickets to Rome for some time and signed up for travel alerts Seeing that the price wasnt going down and afraid that it might go up I finally booked Five minutes after completing the on line booking I received an email from them offering a trip to Rome for 200 less and leaving one day after what I originally planned which is fine with me So I called them to see if it could be changed and they said I would have to cancel and rebook and it would cost me 250 How ridiculous Other agencies will show other departure dates close to the one you enter to give you the best deal BEFORE YOU BOOK RIP OFF Terrible customer service and rude personnelb
The ink on black cartridges is not dark enough It seems light black I plan no to order from them anymore
Flowers delivered a day after valentines day this is absolutely terrible Ill likely look for another company from now on
My experience with these people was a nightmare
I placed a order on 20161216
Note Their site only allow you to place an order if the item is in stock
Nearly one month after they sent me an email saying that 3 items in my order was not in stock offering me to either get a refund or wait undetemently for a restock
This website does NOT comply to its promises They play with your money for a month and then tell you they do not have the product
Dont waste your time and money buying from them
Very bad
Apple really needs to get with the program and utilize their NCF capabilities for smart tags and other NFC supported devices So many things out there using this tech I hate not being able to connect with them This might be the reason I choose Android next update
Customer service was terrible
Communication was terrible
Product knowledge was terrible
So many bad experiences
Once booked two flights with them had a confirmation message from them saying had booked two But only one flight was actually booked with the airline
Spent over two hours on hold trying to sort it out Nothing fixed Promised fifty dollar voucher in recompense never came
Sold me a sensor for the gas sniffer I wanted instead of the actual sniffer They used the image an model number of the actual unit Would not issue refund
Product did not reseal once opened Luckily I had competitiors empty container to transfer the contents to
Product is gritty if only mixed via hand shaker
Little disappointed overall
Totally misleading to state on catalog 25 off when using promo code FOOTWEAR17 when it is only 15 off The price parity with RR storefront in Amazon is achieved by stating MSRP at 10 above when on RRs website So they take 10 off when you add to cart and then second shoe gets 15 in addition Terrible customer service when calling to get corrected pricing
Since you doubled your rate on us we doubled our lack of interest in buying from you
If you go back to status quo we may decide to double our effort to buy more air time Lets see who losses Dont forget that there are alternatives relative to ways of communications Thanks
I ordered a duvet cover which was at the top of my price range but was bitterly dispointed when I had to pay an additional 22 for VAT and an administration fee to the UK courier before they would deliver the item I could find no mention of this on the fine art America website
So be warned  if your order comes from outside the EU and the total cost including PP exceeds 15 you WILL be charged VAT plus an administration fee Customer service were of little help and seemed unaware of UK taxation laws
The plaque and engraving were good However the lucite cover for the scorecard was difficult to remove One screw holding the cover onto the plaque could not be removed causing me to crack the corner of the cover and placing the scorecard in without centering it I seriously debated demanding a replacement but will consider another plaque company if I ever have another hole in one
Despite paying extra on a Thursday to have my card shipped to me overnight there was an unexplained delay from FedEx The card did not arrived prior to my airline departure on the following Monday morning As a consequence I will not be able to use the card for another 90 days thus the title for the review because I could have probably walked across the country in less time that it is going to take for me to simply activate the card Bottom line is if have not even had an opportunity to use the service Im giving it a 1 star rating now as I suspect there will be some sort of issue and some money lost by me as I will be delaying the activation of the service for some time Sorry a one star rating it is On the other hand if this AUTOMATED service has the smarts to send me another opportunity to rate the OneSim in the next 6 months Id be happy to add comments that are less skewed
no confirming email  ended up booking twice and then cancelling one  total confusion
Downloaded the app as prompted but every time I click on the link sent with my voucher code it takes me back to the Google play store to redownload the app
We prebooked a vehicle and advised our flight was landing at 815am it was 830am but thought to put earlier to make sure the vehicle was there When we arrived after 830am we were advised that they had to find another SUV to give us as the one that we had booked had been given to someone else We had arrived to go directly to a funeral and needed the vehicle to be ready straight away Not acceptable service to give the prebooked vehicle to someone else Whats the point of prebooking
Used this website once
Paid 20835 for a pair of shoes a week later a fraudulent transaction of the same amount is withdrawn from my account
Had to follow it up with PayPal fraud control team not a happy customer
Do not use this website
Clicked on a Google Ad when looking for 2 tickets to a gig that had just gone on sale not sold out Saw the horrendous booking fees of about 40 per ticket too late Couldnt cancel the booking Would have saved 80 on Ticketmaster Funny enough the tickets I was finally sent were purchased via Ticketmaster My mistake to fall for it but still misleading and scammy Never again If I had burnt 80 at least it would have been warm for a second or two
PS If I had sold them for the retail price on viagogo I would have made an even bigger loss because of fees again
Used pack and send to deliver and they passed it onto TNT  Did not deliver on Tuesday did not leave a card Said they tried delivery but they didnt Same wednesday Today I waited all day for delivery but they didnt deliver WHAT is going on
Dont ever use this travel agent 
We are a group of 13 travellers booking the same trip but with differrent travel agents the airline decides to cancel return flight 3 months after booking so now we have no return flight Bravofly offers refund or rebooking to different day we are only going 2 days and hotel is booked too and cant be changed We all choose refund but unlikely some of the other travel agents Bravofly charges a handling fee of 20euro to refund the money a cancel I did not ask for or at least I had no other alternative as they didnt even offer to book a seat on a different airline Most other friends is directed to the airnine itself for refund by their travel agent but Bravofly didnt offer that and only far into the refund correspondance its to be known that they dont offer the full refund yes I have read terms and Cond but you cant charge a fee for something I didnt ask to cancel Its like I go into the supermarket and buy milk the milk costs 10dkr I get to the registry and pay 10dkr but before I leave the store they stop me and say hey btw that milk is not for sale after all but we take 2dkr to take it back so you only get 8dkr for not buying your milk In WHAT country and which LAW allows you to do that And I dont give a flying F about what you write in TC you can write anything you want but the law says otherwise 
Story is not over yet I then ask for refund they tell me I can get it minus the fee I say no I dont accept that I wish to cancel refund and talk directly to the airline I get an OK back Then the following days I get 2 seperate emails stating that my refund is accepted and money on the way back to my account I write back again and say I wish to cancel but this time it says we cantTC bla bla bla
This is no longer a money issue its a matter of principle and I will take it all the way to get it back if I have to
Airline I talked to send back money a week ago yet bravofly claims it takes time to get back now after a week I got it back still missing my 20 euro
Did I mention NEVER TO USE BRAVOFLY
Called twice to inquire about backordered reel both times that it was due in tomorrow The calls were two weeks apart On my third call I cancelled the reel Shortly within hours received an email that the item was not available and that the suppliermanufactured had no date for availability
I will never ship with Parcel Monkey again I was looking for a middleman for EMS and unfortunately came across Parcel Monkey through the Google search Here is the list of my experiences 1 printed label has very small font and not adjusted for US paper format 2 pickup by courier was poorly arranged and turned out to be simply FedEx ground 3 after a courier pickup I have not received a single clear confirmation message that my envelope left Newarks hub and still have not received it until this day  a day of delivery I was just getting gibberish apologies from different customer service people located in Philippines or some other distant places 4 Weird tracking system of Parcel Monkey was showing dates from 1970s  I was told that this is a system generated info what an unprofessional comment 5 for one whole midweek day  both Parcel Monkey tracking and Live chat were down and not working Also their work hours are very limited
Lesson learned better pay a bot more money for reputable service than save and be worried and left without service
I would rate 1 start but because my parcel was finally delivered I am reluctantly giving this company 2 stars
Ive just received my photo calendar and Im really disappointed with the quality Ive used Snapfish quite a few times in the past for photo prints and photo books and have always been really impressed with the end product so I expected the calendar to be the same However the print quality is very poor the photos are grainy and dark and the text on the calendar dates arent crisp or sharp and instead it looks like its been done on a poor quality printer Im so disappointed with this Weve had photo calendars before from other companies and theyve been brilliant in comparison this calendar is awful and Ive been put off using Snapfish in the future
I began my request in August Good contact good information very knowledgeable and considerate agent Che Oh The paper work was signed and notarized in a week Everything they requested of me was provided I took the training the following week Four weeks later not a word I called Che and she got right on it She made sure the appraiser was sent late September
Going into October Im told that my credit report is not good The credit report was 3 years old and totally inaccurate Within days I faxed the documentation to refute the credit report Everything was a go
Enter Matt Matt is either very incompetent or extremely overworked Now were in November He tells me that all of the previous documentation I provided is now too old and he needs more current check stubs retirement papers etc Faxed the next day Matt calls again to say that he needs a certified copy of my daughters death certificate Che arranged for this document to be provided to the notary
Now were in late November The notary comes out and I sign all of the documents and provide her with the certified certificate Che says I should receive my money by December 1st December 15th not a word I call again for status Matt calls to say that he cannot verify my employment  where did he think the check stubs were coming from I provided my employers phone number
I finally received my money on Dec 22nd The amount was for 2700 What happened to my 3900 I called Che no answer I called Matt got voicemail  left a message I emailed Jason Bresnock He responded that he was on vacation As of today Feb 6 2017 I have not heard from either one of these people Im too frustrated to pursue the matter any further at this time Needless to say I am not happy with AAG I would not refer anyone to AAG I would never use AAG again
Scam  should not withdrawal funding monthly even if you have opportunity to stop withdrawals Why set up that way Similar models on weight loss pills Only difference you get monthly pills vs eventual clothing shipments which could be monthly due to monthly credit card charges
Absolutely not recommended Quality really poor and terrible
Two weeks 3 oneway emails 2 onestar feedbacks  few tears later after all the hope has gone I am going to refund my valentines present Only valentine present
So thank you very much for your noservice Hope I get those 300 back
So upset
Website and Online booking procedures were easy to navigate
Entered Feb17SAVE25 still only given 10 VIP  If you are not honoring advertised discount you need to CANCEL THIS ORDER
I ordered my stuff over a week ago and still havent received them With no follow up I wont be useing this company again
I never received my order because of your carrier
What a shitty organisation it is They shouldnt be operating on the booking market in the first place as they simply do not understand what makes this business special
Not fit for purpose dont trust them
Unprofessional customer service
Cant believe they still excist in 21 century
Bad service
Ive made an order on November 25 2016 almost 3 months ago and it havent arrived yet and according to the tracking number the item is still on transport to the country of destination on this status since 3122016
Evey time when I contact the customer service they just says they apologize and that they will check it with the carrier and it supposed to take 1015 days and after this time when I contact them again they says the same thing
Because of thie bad service I definitely not recommend to buy from tradeinn
beware when you use their service when package lost  they doesnt help you al all they dont claim for you they dont give you authorization to claim with courier either all i ask is a paper of authorization so that i can claim with fedex myself
i used shipito service more than 5 years since they start business they used to be good but now  i suspect they stole customer products
i suggest everyone dont ever use their sevice who used it now  please change company
I would have liked to buy quite a few pair of high waisted leggings but there was only 1 design in my sizereally not cool Especially since youre having a sale for presidents day there is very little to buy I found that to be the same in the salar capri leggings also I would also like to shop for pants based on compression and I have to check each style to find that there are only a couple offered in high compression How about some full length built in bra tanks as well Not everyone wants to bare their midriff
I got the Quote and sent the book properly and then got an email that I have not sent the exact book so I am not able to receive the money as Quote d 850 and I should get only 130 I have never seen the book they were claimed to be sent by myself Also they said I have to give 399 shipping fee I want to get back the book ITS A FRAUD WEBSITE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME
The site lagged and stuck many times and on many occasion I had to reenter info that I had inserted Bad experience especially compared for example to Eurostars seamless one
dads that were full set were returned saying a disk s missing when all disks where there No idea what people dont pay close attention Sold to the competition
We joined the goldcar queue at 1705 7 customers in front of us nice  sunny outside We actually got to the desk at 1910 really ignorant staff then sent us on a hunt on our own to find the car 60 meters away from the airport office Its now dark outside looking for it in a dark compound Once we found the car we noticed SUBSTANTIALLY more damage on the car than the damage form showed we noted about 40 other dents  scratches So we had to go back in but of course easier said than done as there was a massive queue To cut a really long story short DONT USE GOLDCAR unless you enjoy hassle  queuing
There were 4 members off staff  i remember how one of them just left the office for her break carrying a banana smirking at us as she left seeing how frustrated we all were
We still havent received the 1051 they debited from our credit card because we refused their extortionate insurance The damage on the car was all really old so it seems they debit customers but dont bother repairing the damage Some of the damage was rusty it was so old
Did not disclosure requirement to pay the DHL express delivery person to be given the 1st package after arriving in China The second package has been held by DHL express office in China with risk of being confiscated Attempts to resolve have lead to over 50 emails over the past 34 weeks multiple documentation with risk of breach of confidential documentation with no confirmed information on extra costs to store and duty fees for a personal second hand items  not commercial So far it can be at least twice as much as the cost of sending and value of items This is because the original representative at pack and send did not correctly complete description of items or provide disclosuredeclaration and too vague that ended up being flagged to China leading to a delay until correctdetailedadditional information is provided which I am having to spend time more money and drama in doing while in China Please note that China is a communist country that speak very limited English Australia Post has posted packages with no issues at all
Our rental had RATS the cable and internet didnt work for the whole week Late we found out they werent even supposed to rent it to us I would NOT recommend this company

My first time using this site because I received a coupon code I thought I would give it a try Ordered a medium sweatshirt which is what I always wear Checked their size chart and yes it said I should order a medium Received my sweatshirt and its more like an small or even xsmall I wanted to exchange it  so I could get it for the same price and nope they wouldnt budge I was told I would have to not only return and repurchase for full price but I would also need to pay the 550 shipping We have a large family of sports fans and we will NOT be using them again Terrible first experience I wish I would have read all the reviews first
I booked a hotel in Houston prior to a cruise and asked for a hotel with a shuttle to and from the airport The hotel did not  and never did have according to the hotel staff provide a shuttle service The cost was 4800 each way by taxi because the hotel was down town AMOMA states they are a third party and not responsible for hotel services even if this was a requirement during the booking process
The total bill on the hotel receipt was 9200 US and my visa was billed 20100 Canadian For those who dont know the exchange rates this is a difference of approx 50  65 US
I am now working with the Better Business Bureau to solve this discrepancy with AMOMACom
Stay clear of this site
I ride to respond to the AMOMA web site as requested by the response to my first post and the web site is an Error  they cant even get that right
I just want to buy having an account is uselessannoying for me
Response
That is my second issue then I dont want your website to keep my credit card information
The worst Courier company I have ever had the misfortune to deal with Access Points that refuse delivery Then they change the address to my home address Although it should be obvious that noone is there otherwise why would I have chosen an access point Changed to work address at my request Nobody changed the label on the package so they attempted delivery to home again Guess what Noone home Package has now been sent to another hub Noidea if I am ever going to get the damned thing
We ordered tickets the money has been taken from our account There is no valid phone number to call in the US Our Ticket has been cancelled Very FRUSTRATED
I ordered a part on Friday received an email on Friday from Oscaro saying my order had been processed Its now Tuesday and my part still hasnt shipped I did a live chat with Dominique who said she will keep an eye out for a tracking number when the supplier ships it They wont change the shipping to next day I had to choose that when I placed the order First time ordering from Oscaro and it definitely will be the last Nothing worse then poor customer service Ill go back to ordering from the other online parts stores that value their customers
I havent reveive my order
Ive had a positive experience in the past However I was quite displeased that nearly 2 weeks had gone by and my order was not processed I was proactive in emailing my prescription with order number attached immediately after placing my order Less than an hour later I received a message that appeared to be automated requesting the prescription that was already sent I assumed that the email hadnt been checked This was frustrating because of the delay and the order still would not have been processed if I had not uploaded it online
I am updating my review because I cannot reply to the response from opticontacts Their response was definitely not personalized and my complaint obviously wasnt read I emailed the prescription but it was never uploaded by opticontacts Ive uploaded the prescription yet my order still isnt processed The lack of incompetence is frustrating If you have a system with multiple means of receiving prescriptions why isnt the order processed Why didnt the customer service rep replying to the response not respond with comprehension or resolution The response I should have received was  we are truly sorry for the delay in processing your order however it has been processed and shipping will be expedited I was able to retrieve the email that you sent referencing the order number and I was also able to retrieve the prescription that you uploaded online and Im truly sorry that you are displeased and it has taken so long Im definitely going to send it again considering the contacts are paid for and I cant get reimbursed without receipt
For the past 34 months it is a pain to view the retail because it takes to long to load the pictures and then to open up an item The shopping cart keeps changing the number of items and I almost feel like giving up
TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE
TOTAL INCOMPETENT IDIOTS WORKING THERE
IF YOU WANT ANYTHING DONE IN A TIMELY MANNER NEVER USE THESE MORONS
TERRIBLE PRODUCTS

I replaced my older MacBook pro in 2012 with a new MacBook pro because the screen had developed several vertical lines of varying colors
The new laptop refused to show movies that my old laptop showed over an lcd projector apparently the computer protects the copyright of the movie That means its working for someone other than myself When the hard drive crashed they offered to upgrade to the latest operating system I was agreeable and had the drive replaced and upgraded Even though bootcamp made a partition for a windows installation the windows system will not go on line It worked fine on my old MacBook pro I have downloaded three different sets of drivers and adapters changed from 32 to 64 bit installations But it will not go on line Apple refuses to work with the windows system I must turn to another source than apple for help Im considering just buying a windows laptop two programs I use as a teacher require windows
I could not recharge today when I needed most
Love the pricing just wish they would actually have sizes and colors available Always low or out of stock Mens sizes especially hard to get anything in the right size Considering cancelling the membership as I have been charged every month even though I have signed on and declined the monthly choice every month
Not cool when they do not uphold the agreement that as long as you log on and SKIP your monthly selections you will not be charged need to step it up on their end
Ok heres my timeline Ordered frames on Jan 2nd billing and shipping didnt match up ok so I fixed it by Jan 4th Order started processing and billed on Jan 6th By Jan 10th still processing so I decide to change the size of the frames Jan 11th Order Cancelled due to no stock in that size ok no problem Website stated refund issued immediately and should be posted to my account within 3 business days ok great Jan 13th still no refund contacted customer service via email because I like everything in writing Was told by rep to wait 1 to 5 business days fine Well its Jan 23rd now and still no refund Sent them another email Jan 21st and no response Sent them another email directly from website today and will wait for response By end of this week if I have not received my refund I will be contacting my credit card company to report them for fraud This has been a terrible experience with GoOptic if you want to risk it then its up to you but by the looks of it a lot of people are unhappy with their serviceThey are not accredited with BBB yet have a 1 star rating with BBB hhhmmm interesting Their low prices are not worth this headache go elsewhere pay a little extra and actually get what you pay for with good service
UPDATE Refund received Paid in US so when I received the refund it wasnt actually the full amount since the US  rate had changed Anyway this was a terrible experience and Im just glad its over
I was charged for VIP status on a bra The bra was 49 change but it was shown as 29 change I only agreed to buy that bra as shown at the 29 price As far as 1999 for the cosmetic bag I thought that was a gift with purchase I dont even really need that So why do I have to pay 20 extra for a bra that was not part of my choice for this monthI already opted out for Feb but I wanted just the 29  shipping bra that I chose tonight If this is being counted as my Feb VIP choice cancel
Are we not allowed to buy a la carte items marked down for VIP members when we did not want the outfit chosen for us for 49 As a VIP member is everything we buy 49 I did not see this earlier
After moving countries My mum kindly got my boyfriend an I a gift voucher She did it through AllGifts and we received an email saying she had bought us a fifty euro tesco voucher which was so sweet It was an email which had attached a PDF which looked exactly like a gift card Said it was a gift card So I went to tesco to try and use it and was told while trying to pay that the voucher code just looked like gibbledegook to the clerks The AllGifts email was a gift card to use on their website in order to buy a tesco gift cardWhich would then be delivered in ten working days So misleading Led to an extremely embarrassing situation It is a hassle and a half to even work out the website and while they say it is possible to order it to collect there was no option for me to do that with the tescos gift card Im just hoping that mine turns up now Not a great experience
Wait until you are a longtime high spending customer The refusals to replace products that arrive damaged no refunds and no discounts for incorrect products that often arrive over a week after you order them 1 to 2 day shipping begin to accrue once you are a loyal customer and Chewycom believes you no longer need the high quality customer service they lavish on you when you are new to their company
I wash my hands of this company after too many instances of poor treatment towards established customers versus the courting phase they lavish on new customers I was averaging approximately 10000 a year I was spending at Chewycom Not anymore
I still havent recovered from asking them to please remove a review they allowed a customer to post on a dog ramp that read it was Good for LOSERS dogs I was curtly told by Chewy that they wont censor any reviews even if they contain crude remarks towards the handicap population I explained I was looking at that dog ramp for a friend of mine that was a disabled military veteran that lost his leg during combat He has a service dog a German Shepherd and Id appreciate it if they could remove the review some sick person left calling people like my friend a LOSER Nope I know they censor their reviews because it takes 1 to 2 days of review after you submit one And Ive never noticed a review utilizing obscene language being posted
Allowing a post that calls my disabled veteran friend a loser for needing a ramp for his dog set a tone for me with this company and now after so many bad customer service experiences after being a loyal highspending client Im disgusted with them
Rip off site Dresses look nothing like photos on here I ordered a dress totally different from pic  return policy you have to pay for shipping and handling again and also the door delivery  wen u wrote a review on fb they blocked me
I was with eUKHost for quite a few years up until a virus was uploaded to my site Their tech team disabled my site and instructed me to remove the infected files  I am completely ok with how this was carried out
However I was not fine when their indian team were rude and condescending when I told them they had not given me access to my files so that I could remove them It took a few days of back and forth with them eventually fixing their issue no apology from them just a rude ok we fixed it  now do what we told you first
Companies really need to stop delegating tech support to india It never works and never provides a good experience
I placed an order requiring samples I returned the samples to have embroidered and orderd about 10 more I placed a deposit on order There are a few transactions going on making it a little hard to keep track of so I dont blame Triple Crown for what I think is an overcharge but I contacted them over a week ago and they havent gotten back
The car was great reliable and well serviced The pick up at the airport went smoothly the team at Christchurch welcoming and patient with all my questions
Returning the car at Auckland was also reasonably quick with few formalities
Thanks Omega
Irresponsible baards Canceling flights after over 10 days from reservation sucks
I booked hotels and other flights
I dont care if it was error or joke you were offering product and you should be responsible to provide it Should be cancelled within 4872 hrs not 10days
Watch this company everyone  they are not reliable
Chrome Rims on a 2011 hhr were covered with corrosion i was also given the run around from day 1 about people to talk to  numbers to call still the problem hasnt been resolved the first car wash a grey substance came off the rims showing even more corrosion all over the rims no Im not happy about my experience why would drivetime expect you to pay 30000 for a 2011 car with corrosion on all the rims  treat the matter as nothing
I WAS MISLEAD AND DID NOT GET MY CERTIFICATE IN TIME THEN WHEN I CALLED AND ASKED FOR HELP NO ONE CARED THE SERVER KEPT CRASHING WHICH CAUSED ME GRIEF A TOTAL DISASTER
I have ordered a bouquet of red roses for my girlfriend for Valentines
I had expected the flowers to be delivered in the morning to my girlfriends office However the flowers had not been delivered as expected
There is no tracking service online and I had to wait on the customer service line for over 20 mins to speak to a customer representative who informed me the delivery would be made at 4pm However the flowers were only delivered at 8pm to my girlfriends office which of course my girlfriend was no longer there to receive the flowers
I would at least expect the florist shop to contact myself or my girlfriend both of our details were provided when ordering to arrange for a delivery to a different address when the delivery was expected to be late
I believe the quality of the service is significantly below what I would expect as a professional service

I was passed back and fourth between sales and service apparently no one wanted to give me a Quote  Multiple times email Quote s were not readable I was told by one agent that it was too confusing and he wanted another person to handle the insurance for a house I am buying It took days was a frustrating experience When our insurance renews we will explore other companies for our house auto and umbrella policies Agents clearly need more training I spoke to 8 agents some multiple timesOne agentMary was able to send a readable document and Steven gave some helpful information
I have ordered flowers for my girlfriend to be delivered at her adress in Sevilla Unfortunately she was called to take herself the flowers from the delivering company I am not satisfied at all also by the reaction of the company as their only response on the customer service on whatsapp whas the flowers were delivered Taking everything into consideration I will fill complaint to the european authorities for consumer protection because this behaviour cannot stay like this incomplete services unsatisfactory dialogue with the client no apologies or explanation
I have been a Shipito customer for almost 4 years now using their services on and off over this time But after they mishandled one of my package whatever good words I had to say about them has gone down the drain After consolidating one of my packages and depositing money in my account to ship this package nothing happens This package had goods worth 400 USD I logged onto my account only to find a support ticket for a Missing Package they never bothered to email me to let me know that my package was missing and I was waiting around for it for nothing TWO MONTHS have passed of back and forth conversations with their customer service team who keep advising me they will contact such and such person for them to get back to me THEY NEVER DO Now they are holding my money that I paid for the deposit on the shipment despite putting in two requests to have that refunded weeks ago The package is missing presumably stolen and despite them listing photos in my account of the consolidated package they are requesting that I prove to them what was in fact in that package No refund on my shipping deposit and no compensation for a lost package No communication going around in circles every time which ends up nowhere They have scammed me of almost 500 US dollars and refuse to do anything about it STAY AWAY Do NOT open an account with these guys they are frauds and would do anything to keep your money or to avoid accountability for their errors I have contacted my bank and got all my shipito transactions as listed as fraudulent so I can receive at the very least some compensation for my wasted time money and effort
The most shocking and inhumane customer service I have ever experienced Absolutely disgraceful business ethics All LM staff I dealt with are dismissive and dishonest
The 2 redspot personnel were taking too long attending each customers I got a voucer of 10 rebate and free gps but the lady did not offer one despite my reminder however the earlier customer was given a wifi dongle for use
I got the hair but I did not get the acessories that was on the order
My daughter got ro Tampa to pick up the car I rented for her from Budget I entered her age of 22 the price was 21800 for the week until she got there and then she was told 70000 Sorry very happy when shes almost in tears
I was looking for a solution to having a US phone number while I was in the US and data while I am traveling in the Caribbean Somehow I spent about 150 USD and ran out of data and phone credit in about three days while in Miami TMobil offers unlimited data text and calls for 95 per month Data and text work internationally calls are 20 per minute while out of country I just got back to the Caribbean  seems to be working so far
The flowers were supposed to be delivered on Valentines Day It is now a day after Valentines Day and the flowers have still not been delivered I am not happy with that
Oh my goodness it was delivered after hours and to top it off the bouquet looked nothing like the picture I was appalled and embarrassedI tried to contact customer service and of course no reply so I will be disputing this a 40 arrangement that looked like weeds from the backyard
I ordered my contacts but they did not arrive in time promised Which was very important Now I am out of the country and do not have my contacts and currently have to figure out how to get them shipped to Central America without being charged a huge import tax Not to mention its not cheap to ship items here Not satisfied this situation has turned into a super inconvenient and expensive experience
An edit to your response Your company took a full 7 days to even process my order
Had my laptop shipped to manufacturer to fix a software issue they fixed it and sent it back through purolator and it returned with a hole punched through the shipping box and my screen broken Purolator denied my claim as I sent it at senders risk
Absolutely terrible customer service
Avoid this company at any cost Unless you want to pay twice for same They stolen my money I paid 140 for my booking when I get to the rental desk lady said sorry your flight was delayed and now you have to pay another 19335 or we cancel your booking completely When I get back after holiday try get the refund and now after two months waiting they keep telling me now Ive asked for an upgrade and they not gonna refund my money This is just discussting practice how they treat their customers Im going to court with my case Who letting them doing business Bunch of thieves
There are some good sitters on this site Unfortunately if you end up with a bad one Rover assume no responsibility or assistance at all They do have a socalled insurance protection but just like any insurance plan they deny all claims to save money The guarantee is merely a scam so good luck with this I am not going to use it anymore and will trust a chain franchise like Camp Bow Wow or Petsmart instead At least the staff there are more reliable and are held responsible for their actions
ps Thank you for the response As always your company provided many empty apologies via email without any true action or compensation Refusing to issue any refund compensation issue disciplinary actions or even provide assistance working with an insurance company all the way in Southfield MI who refused to review any evidence I would like to present from NY and rejected any claim submitted You have kind words to wish my pets well but I dont trust your service or guarantee anymore Even Uber take responsibilities about their drivers and have disciplinary actions against their drivers whereas your sitters are still practicing with 5star reviews despite complaints and reports of negligence For refusing to take any action towards your negligent sitters it is your negligence also
DHGate the worst company ever a bunch of Chinese crooks
For a 15 year I have been fighting for my money back order  1574215211 from May 2015
On May 32015 I ordered a pair of shoes because they had sent me a wrong size too big I have sent them back Never received another pair or money refund
These people do not have any reputation I am not the only customer fighting for money back they truly deserve to be out of business

I had worked extremely hard doing surveys reviews creating content and so on But suddenly they told me my account was closed and All My Points Forfeited Effectively I lost 400 600 and there is no appeals process the decision is final They said I took two out of hundreds surveys too fast plus after two surveys they detected what they call fraud but they provide zero evidence or proof They keep the 400 from my hard work and I end up with zero I am on panel base cint swagbucks ipoll crowdology  many other survey sites and this has never happened so clearly I am innocent and they have stolen my hard earned wages Awful In addition they never warned me the first time they saw a socalled problem No warning or advice for a hard working employee just a sudden being thrown out And other members will probably be worried about me due to suddenly disappearing This company is terrible other members have also told about imaginary fake profiles winning the prize draws which is fraudulent also Very bad company dont waste your time
Update Tolunas reply to my review below said they were sorry and I should email them so they can help So I did and my email was ignored So their reply below was just another PR stunt to try and make it look like they arent as bad as my review states
I had ordered a pair of Oakley Servos recently because they were cheaper than retail and seemed legitimate I ordered them on 114 and my healthcare HSA Visa card had quickly been charged for them A few days later I received an email stating that my transaction was high risk and that i would need to provide pictures of my ID and the payment card i used I complied and even contacted phone support to provide my address for confirmation I was then informed that my order was confirmed and I could expect my glasses to be processed and shipped as soon as they were done
A few days later I contacted chat support to check on my order status Per the chat line i was informed that my order had been reflagged by the payment provider Now Please understand the HSA Visa card I used had already been charged and the payment posted so it was apparent that the transaction had already gone through After repeated attempts to get the chat agent to understand that I had already confirmed my order previously over the phone she apologized and stated that they could take PayPal and reprocess my payment Unfortunately HSA cards dont use PayPal and I was hesitant to provide even more private information to a company I knew nothing about so I declined
I called the toll free number on the SmartBuyGlassescom website immediately after my confrontation with the chat agent I was told on the phone that my order was being made and that it would be shipped out on Thursday 124 Feeling reassured I assumed the matter was resolved and my glasses would be arriving shortly
Early this morning I received another email from the company stating that my order had indeed been reflagged and that I would need to pay via PayPal At this point I am at the end of my rope with this company and will be pursuing a payment dispute with my HSA card provider if I do not get a proper resolution
MI OPINION ES DE TODAS LAS MALAS TELEFONICAS  LA PEOR
I was going to buy more from the company but when trying to use the 35 gift promotion I couldnt get it to work I instead said forget it and just bought the 2 pairs of capris Your loss
They would not give tracking info and now about 55 days after my order was placed I still have not received anything Am currently disputing through PayPal
BUYER BEWARE
Bad advertising
Glasses arrived quickly but were missing parts and therefore not fit for purpose They didnt seem new Customer service was quick to respond but there was some confusion re the refund process Finally got a refund after the glasses were out of stock Very dissapointed as I just wanted the glasses which were originally sent is a new condition which is what I paid for
I will never use rental pros again Worst experience Ive ever had Place was so dirty washer and dryer broken kitchen was so dated and dirty the mattresses had to be 20 plus years old Please never use rental pros
This company keeps raising the prices for the service it provides Pretty soon another company with a better or comparable services will come along and give a economic break to the people who can not afford to keep paying such a hardship  Lllama Colombia just gives excuses whenever they want to increase their prices
Other than the coop from support Margaret  Darrell this experience has been a total nightmare I ordered from medmartonlinecom a voyager ceiling lift on January 13 webpage showed in stock so we expected delivery to be within 7 to 10 business days Subsequently lift not in stock Available January 31 2017 Support team found another compatible lift for our track system upon delivery the lift was damaged and not trustworthy for our needs so had to be returned Now we are in wait for the next compatible lift which we have been told will be shipped today no word on thatas parents of a child in need of total need care daily I am only going to comment now how frustrating this has been
i have booked a couple of flights two months ago for me and my sisters  one of my sisters lea eid didnt receive her visa yet  i called to postpone her flight and was given an extremely unacceptable offer wich is twice the amount of the first flight i booked so i have to decline it  after that i tried to reach them because i have fullflex wich entitles me for 90 cash back but no1 would answer  i have been paying 610 euros on each unsuccessfull call without talking to any1   i have 3 more days before the flight and i will keep trying to reach them but i have already paid a fortune on unsuccessfull phone calls wich is absurd   the rules say that they cant give me a fullflex refund unless its 48hours prior  so i guess they are postponing me until my refund is no longer valid and charging me on the way  i wont stop until i get my 90 refund back 
Waiting one monthstill no sign of it for a twin stroller Ordered and paid for online on 4th Jan Made several calls to the customer service dept Each time being told they would chase it up and call back Apparently this item was dispatched from warehouse on 3 occasions but Ive yet to receive it Baby due very soon Shocking terrible service took my money on day of booking 4th Jan and as of 4th Feb no product or explanation received
Quality control is obviously not a priority One of the supports was drilled at an angle resulting in a screw hole aligned to the edge THis piece has to be replaced Customer service is some what helpful but parts fulfillment is slow I like the rack case but I spent days trying to figure out how to properly mount everything to fit my existing rack rails After five attempts I figured out a method that would allow me to close the front door with the back door mounted and using my existing slides This configuration unfortunately does not work with the three shelves or the middle support brackets shipped with the cabinet They are very shallow compared to the depth of the cabinet Assembly has been a very frustrating and time consuming experience This is not my first rack installation but I hope it is my last Update I did receive my replacement brackets and they sent an extra one for some reason
bookit is fraudulentthe false advertise I searched for resorts where kids stay free and bookit still tried to include the cost in taxes For instance I needed 2 rooms both with 2 adults and 1 kid One child is 1 and the other is 11 years old I received a Quote for a free child  room with the oneyearold and I had to pay for the 11yearold  that is fine with me The price Quote I received for the room with the 1 year old had almost 400 dollars in taxes and fees  equivalent to the cost of 1 extra person in the room and 12 of the over all price The second reservation for the same exact room and dates had taxes for only forty dollars What a scam when i called customer service for an explanation no one could help i have screen shots of both Quote s made at the same exact time
horrible website not even feedback no solution
they didnt even contact

Totally scalped with misleading sales techniques No satisfaction from complaints into policies which protect professional scalpers If I could give a minus review I Would
Good j received my orders n refunds if need be
The money and and dates didnt match
Not the flowers I ordered and not even half the roses on the picture
Edit I had a phone conversation with a lady who said theyd look into it and contact me This hasnt happened yet so the response below is totally irrelevant
The funniest thing was she said prices can go up during Valentines day Then why dont you just have higher prices on your website instead of delivering a quarter of the flowers on the picture and not even the same flowers
I guess the period around Valentines day is no period to order flowers from Euroflorist from I have no experience with other periods If I get a solution from Euroflorist Ill report that here too For now everyone be careful
I paid all the money  but they told me two months later they did not book what i want the hotel they asked me to change the hotel or refund
after passing the final test one still need to download and print out an affidavit take it to a local notary public to have ones identity verified and fax it to somewhere bad product no response from online customer support

Unorganized and many vague questions Improper sentence structure that made some questions and teaching methods
cumbersome
Sold 4 tickets through Ticketmaster Resale which is suppose to be reliable and safe  let me tell you its not Over two weeks after selling my tickets I still did not receive any money I finally called and was given the run around  the staff on the phone were very confused They told me excuses as to why I did not receive the money then later in the conversation would admit that they were wrong and confused I had to request to talk to the manager before I got any clarity but I still have not received any money and I am not holding my breath
Good if you buying something and deal complete without issues
If any problems with purchase then you will talk with wall send an question to ebay and get standard answer  please read FAQ or contact seller or resolve problem on paypal They no care about buyer they care only to receive fees and charges
If private seller and sell something then feescharges over high You loose more then get
Everything work for only for paying feescharges to ebay and no care about buyers and sellers
so much time wasted this past 2 weeks Too much to explain and I have wasted enough time sorting out various issues Ive had
I booked a flight from Santiago de Chile  Sao Paulo  Paris and return from Madrid to Santiago de Chile with LAN Airlines I received my etickets from FlightNetwork but when I tried to check the booking confirmation into LAN Airlines website the booking looks incomplete It only shows from Madrid to Santiago de Chile only the return way I contacted them by chat but they arent helper at all They asked me to call by phone to try to fix that The booking looks good into FlightNetworkcom but not into LAN Airlines I hope that they can solve that or what can I do They dont return money Be careful if you deal with this company This was my first and last time dealing with them
I ordered a prom dress with custom measurements The dress came quickly and when I took it out of the package I immediately noticed how cheaply it was made and how it looked absolutely nothing like the picture I ordered a dress of obvious plus size measurements and the arm holes for the dress looked like they were made for a small child to fit into Ive been contacting them for almost a week trying to get a refund and Ive gotten no where Never order from this place
I would give them the worst review because the minute I placed a large order they emailed me a coupon Buy 3 get 1 FREE with FREE shipping When I called to asked if they would apply the coupon to my order with the FREE shipping she said NO and the lady was really rude on top of it What bad business people Never again

The car was not full of petrol when I picked it up and I had to paid for it  I told the guys from the service desk but I didnt have a answer  I think that is not fair and Im not going to rent a car here never again
The product quality is excellent but hard to find products available in my size due to being out of stock 
Keep shopping for better quality and better channels
After 1 month of waiting for refund of cancelled orders

I paid for a 30 dark red roses bouquet they deliver 15 dark red roses bouquet 
Ordered a 50 Argos voucher and got two 25 vouchers instead Obviously cant use the two vouchers at once so now Ill have to add money to the vouchers to buy what I want
Dont offer 50 vouchers if you dont have them in stock
How can it be so hard to provide invoices This is extremely annoying and time consuming
They gave me a Quote for a storage and when I got to the storage the storage place looked at me like I was smoking crack They said oh was it from Sparefoot
Salesman looked up original price for us on a chair and told us the highest it was listed was in the 300s and the price tag said was 739 Los Angeles is suing stores for this practice right now
We hired a car with winterisation package then got to Geneva and asked to add an additional driver At this point we were told we needed snow chains or 4 wheel drive and offered an upgrade to an automatic car with GPS
The car we were given was manual and the GPS didnt work which meant we got stuck in traffic in Geneva for 1 12h hours When we complained at the Budget desk we were told we should have come back which would have added another 1 12h to our journey They then said in the 10 minutes it took us to get from the car to the helpdesk that they had tested the GPD and all was well When we complained again we were told by the desk manager to send an email
Done that and offered 10 off my next booking Not particularly helpful customer services and massive con A winter package includes what you need for winter already Seriously unimpressed by customer services and no where on website where you can leave honest feedback How convenient
Did not get my purchase and no way to track delivery
Bessere Titel whlen
I sent a mobile recharge to a Nigerian account my account was debited of course the recipient did not receive the credit  2500 worth The money sounds small but its so disgusting that after 2 days no one has responded to my emails there is no customer service phone number for me to call and Im thinking  THIS IS THE LAST TIME I EVER TRANSACT WITH THIS COMPANY Its just disgusting rude and u acceptable Was supposed to be a surprise birthday gift for my sister
We had to cancel our flight due to the death of my wifes mother The very purpose of this trip was to visit her This flight is still 1 month ahead and they still charge me 250 per ticket Compassion seems to be a strange word to this company
Sometimes there is no clarity in voice on other side of phone call while making phone calls to India using phone India calling card Sometimes there is background noise while making phone call to India using phone India calling card Sometimes calls can not be completed for some reason when I call to India using phone India calling card as I hear some one saying authentication failed Please improve your service
I am spending more money now than I did with my last supplier customer service not very nice It cost me 50euro to cancel my contact with the other supplier and it would cost me a lot more with these I would not be recommending them to anyone
I Ordered an in stock item that stated it would ship that day After several days my order hadnt arrived so sent them an email No response so eventually found their phone number as the one listed on their website was out of service
Enquired where my order was and was told they are due in soon The person hung up on me when I pointed out that they were still showing as being in stock on their website
I called back an got through to a different representative who told me that they may not be getting them back at all
The product was still in stock several weeks later too
Eventually received a refund but was severely cheesed off at being lied to and the time wasted chasing up this order NEVER AGAIN
Still waiting on order Very slow
For the price I paid they were good quality but when contacting customer service with inquireshelp they are very rude I felt not important and when asking for help they arent very knowledgeable This will not be my go to choice in eye wear
I paid over 20 for 2 day shipping I was told it would be delivered on Sunday I still have not received my order two days after the guaranteed delivery date I will never purchase anything from them again and I recommend others dont either With the issues caused waiting for this part to arrive delaying the project another two days It would have been cheaper for me to purchase a new framing nailer
When will the resale proceeds be sent to my credit card
Great tickets but the fees are ridiculous Each ticket was 134 no problem but the transaction fees were nearly half that for what Regular FedEx delivery so why the astronomical fees This service sucks
I ordered springs for my door and they sent the wrong ones Trying to stand behind their no refund clause on springs I agree with other reviewers and think this is a scam company The springs they sent are weak garbage compared to the ones that I am trying to replace
BEWARE
I am posting this complaint on as many complaint sights I can find I should have checked the complaints on this company and I would have purchased else where
Great customer service too I ordered them wrong Sorry  how about just admit that the wrong ones were sent and give me my money back I sent you the photos to show you what I wanted and ordered If YOUR system got it WRONG than correct it If not I call it a SCAM Send out crap and stick the customer with it
These are knock offs of original springs
There are enough companies to order garage door parts from  just read all the reviews to make the right decision  I wished I did
And those positive reviews  match them up to the names of people who work there 
Customer Service A See how they handle sending wrong items below
The item arrived in a broken box I email 2x for full refund and how to obtain a prepaid method of shipping Dress is hanging unused no comm from PromGirl  so they must not care
I love the item but like so many other small furniture items that require assembly at home the items was not protected at the corners enough Since the item took a long time to arrive and it wasnt all that expensive I am not going to take up more time effort to return it knowing that a replacement has the same risk of damage Its unfortunate
The items listed on the site are NOT in stock For example the carhartt items you order are then ordered from carhartt by Triple Crown obviously to save on inventory overhead but they should be clear about this when you order You wait for shipping twice once from the manufacturer to Triple Crown then from Triple Crown to you The item was also out of stock at the manufacturer I was never informed of this until a month passed and I asked what the hold up was for ONE sweatshirt with a one line embroider If you are in a hurry better call to be sure
The site said order would ship in 2 to 5 days and a tracking  would be emailed to me On the 5th day had to contact them to find out me order hadnt been shipped On the 12th day still hadnt received a tracking  If it wasnt for the fact they had the best price for what I wanted I would have more then upset with this purchase
See above the terrible experience with more than 10 characters
For several months after I moved into my new house the electricity meter wasnt working I paid the bills as they came in but eventually noticed that the meter readings were all the same I reported that and they installed a new meter in November Then I got a bill for 440 for the period when the meter was faulty an estimate based on consumption from November onwards higher usage than in summer I protested that NovemberDecember consumption would be higher than in summer and reminded them that it was I that pointed out the faulty meter They denied this I am now moving to another company
I am so disappointed by the service I received from Bravofly I have booked my flight in my maiden surname by mistake My passport is in my married surname When I tried to phone Bravofly to change the name on my booking to my married surname at a cost of EUR610 I was advised that I would receive an email with the costs to change the name within 24 hours as they dont know I phoned again the next day at a further cost of EUR610 only to be told that I would receive the information via phone within 7 days Still nothing I phoned again 7 days later at a further cost of EUR610 only to be told that the airline has not yet responded and I should phone back again in another 7 days time Apparently because my flights are only for May 2017 the airline is in no rush to assist me But if I phone the airline directly they will be able to assist IMMEDIATELY However they demand that I work through Bravofly This whole experience has left me angry and frustrated How many times do I have to phone at a cost of EUR610 per call before this issue is resolved Taking money for NOTHING looks like FRAUD to me I am about to report this company on every website and every platform and with every authority out there until I get the results I am entitled to
I love my Apple products but have recently just had the worst experience with customer support and communication that I have had in a long time I called last week and they tested the battery on my iPad and said I needed a new battery Made an appointment to drive an hour and a half to get the battery replaced only to find out they didnt replace a battery they gave you a whole new iPad which of course they did not have in stock because they did not communicate to the store the situation So today I get an email that the replacement part is in stock and to come back to the store Spent 45 min just trying to get another reservation and hopefully when I go next week on my hour and a half jaunt that they will get this taken care of Not one time did anybody explain that your iPad needed to be fully backed up because youre just going to get a new one and its up to you to get everything set up again Just basic details that they should communicate
I have ordered and sent so much money Beware when you return something they give store credit that you cannot use on sale shoes OR they charge you to return for a credit Also they dont tell you that you cant have multiple accounts but they will cancel you quickly if you do
I received an email after this review We always encourage members to only keep one account open to better manage their account however they do not say this anywhere when you sign up AND they have canceled ALL of my accounts So all the money I have spent and they do not even allow me to have one account open and did not warn of this in advance
When you have an operator who is difficult to understand ask for another
Very bad customer service Customer service stuff is very lazy and un knowledgeable Could not even found anything for exchange They are do not care if they loose customers Plus look at their Yelp is a disaster Would not recommend them
I ordered hats with patches sewn on Detail was okay but its just embroidered right on the hat not a patch Anyway those looked okay Tried to do the same thing with beanies The beanie order didnt go through had to make a bunch of calls back and forth to get the second half of the order weeks later The patches sewn onto the beanies had no border at all no merrowing or anything close to it just cut out pieces of fabric and it looked like crap I asked for a credit on my next order for half of the cost of the beanies and they wouldnt budge an inch This is essentially false advertising Also product is made to order in China so they dont offer a very fast service Wont be using them again
I recently shopped for a Superbowl flag and chose this vendor because they claimed that they had it I even chose expedited shipping so that I could receive it the week before the game On the Tuesday before the game they called me and said the flag would ship two days AFTER the Superbowl I could have chose other vendors and paid a little more for a guaranteed flag by the Superbowl Fortunately the company allowed me to cancel my order But with no other options as it was too late to get one elsewhere I am still without a flag Hence two stars instead of one
Incidentally I saw a response by AmericanFlagscom to a customer complaining that their flag didnt arrive in a timely manner The response by the company claimed that technically they were within their guaranteed expedited shipping window even though it took them many days to process and ship the order I find this an unacceptable copout to a customer who is legitimately dissatisfied with the companys timeliness Im disgusted and wont shop at this vendor ever again
I ordered Valentines day flowers to be sent to my wife while she was at work I specifically ordered the flowers to be delivered in the morning
In the end the flowers were not delivered
Just a worthless service there is no point in delivering Valentines day flowers the next day
I placed and order on January 18 2016 I took measurement before placing this order and then even went up a size on the order My order was for two swim suits one arrive the other never did Their sized are way off the suit I did receive was about 12 the size I expected there is no way I could wear it I have tried to contact them and I can not get any response I will never order any thing from them again This is my last ditch effort to be heard by Zulily
I am very displeased with your redundant service I thought this was supposed to be a discrete process but instead of being discrete you sent me 9 emails regarding this purchase  several text messages and then when my package arrived the front label had a sender  stating the package was from Actiza Pharmaceutical 
With all of this you might as well have put a picture of a hard penis on the package as well
I feel you violated my privacy  4 people saw this package before I did and there were many questions regarding its contents
I will never order from you again  you violated my privacy and caused me very difficult situations

60 of the Belgian population speaks FlemishDutch Why does this site assume French in its communication with me At least it could offer two or maybe three languages when communicating in multi language countries
Order a pair of slipper socks which arrived damaged Had to wait days for DHL to come and collect ship back and then get a replacement pair During all of this I chased a number of times but no one answers or responds to emails  a complete lack of communication
New pair eventually arrived  wrong colour They expected me to wait in again for DHL ship back and then they would send a new pair I explained that this was unacceptable After much arguing and debate they promised to send a new pair first  I was told that would be done one day  it was not I was told it would be done the next day  it was not I was then told the item was out of stock  so  basically lied to and fobbed off
In the end I demanded a refund and kept the item I must say however this is by far the worst experience I have had with an online retailer A total lack of customer service a complete absence of common sense no communication whatsoever and very much a dont really care attitude
A complete disappointment I would strongly suggest that you think incredibly carefully before you buy anything from this company
every time i picked a style or color it was out
why keep showing commercials if you dont have enough stock
very disappointed
Digitalland charged me 8366 Dkk start january 2017
They still havent delievered and after I wanted reimbursement they now withold 1521 Dkk
Not acceptable and I demand full reimbursement for a nondeal
I have to say I was pretty disappointed with my first ever order from Muscle Meals Direct
I ordered the 12 meal option and chose every meal individually However I received meals i didnt order
Another big disappointed was that the actual label on the container was not consistent with the meal inside on a couple of occasions
The meat meals I ordered like kangaroo mince and beef balls were absolutely disgusting and inedible I had one bite and threw them in the bin They were so dry and had a terrible smell and taste
I went to your website because I was told in an email that you had put 3500 in my account When placing order I was not given the chance to review and see the 35 credited to my account How shady is this Cancel my order
Also when I navigated through the website I thought I clicked on progressive lenses but somehow ended up with bifocals I think I needed assistance or a review of order before having completed it When I contacted the rep you would have thought I had offended her personally by her response
Title sums it up Rep would not take repeated now for answer I am cancelling asap Waste of both or time and company money to conduct business this way
1st class transaction all round Cannot be beaten on exchange rates Will definately use again and tell family and friends

Hi there
Ihave used Flugladen through Momondo search engine at particular point of time 6 months before my flight I had many options for same or lower price I have chosen Flugladen as there were only 1 stop ovor and good connection from Vienna to Jakarta through Amann Our flight had changed several times at the last time you have change the flight destination to Kuala Lumpur  which is even different state I could not get anyone on your phone number for 2 days and you replied after 4 days on my emai The feedback is very slow given the fact that sometime you need to reach the agency just hours before your flight At the end we manage to change it back to Jakarta however we will not book with Flugladen anymore Sorry Piece of advice  Pls work on your call center and do not change your flights 5 times over time
The part I needed was very easy to find on their site The cost was right in line and I received the part in just a few days They can not be beat
I placed an order a week ago and has yet to recieve a confirmation email or anything I cannot track my order nor view what i have purchased Tried calling the customer service number listed multiple times but after about 20 minutes the phone disconnects Soo i tried emailing them and i did get a response but i was told my order is still being processed Still processing really And lets not forget about the order number they sent me that when i tpye it in it says wrong order number Something seems fishy Soo now its 125 and I have received some of my items however something was back oreder whatever that means so now how do I track that item This is getting ridiculous
I am writing this comment from Germany First of all it is strange that
this Company got a very Reputation in different Foren The best Ratings are based in China or Asia where the stuff is produced
I ordered a Suite  before I have to explain that my meaussurements were
taken by a tailor  meains accurate  I got a Suite which was far a way from what I was expecting Any Suite bought in a shop would fit better
Sent a complaint Got as answer Please shoot photos and send to us I did it Than they offered me either to send the Suite to Spain  on my expenses and get a new one  or send  30 and get a new one
Funny was the question can you please send us the meassurements which are wrong What a joke the Suite is wrong Than they told me to produce a new Suite based on the photos I have sent
This Company is cheating The Quality is sh the Service is sh
I am taking an attorney and will complaint at Paypal as well
DO NOT BUY
Waste of money Basically they just cut your picture very badly and slap it on a white background Picture looks horrible  I really hope the passport office accepts When I went to pick it up I also had to pay us the printing fee at CVS What did I pay this company for You are better off to go to your local store and get a passport picture taken Probably looks better in cost a lot less Plus faster

Since the end of 2016 my husband and I have been working with Damien Maynard to try to add an additional home to our policy and change the existing home on our policy to a rental wanting to do this all at once Damien has been minimally or non responsive to questions and phone calls that would allow us to complete this policy change and switch our current home to California Casualty This is incredibly frustrating and very unlike my past experiences with this company
1st  You charge for a poduct unavailable you should update your files and dont let the customer ordering and pay a product that you dont have in stock
2d You inform me that the product was unavailable and ask me what I would like in exchange Very good  The problem is that you didnt care about what I choosed for the same value You just decided yourself what I will get in exchange Very fair from you  Thank you very much

Easy to book on line but my 125 all inclusive economy car for three days ended up costing me 31001 They couldnt goner this reservation and couldnt tell me why My credit card was charged immediately and this was all done at the Avis rental counter the Minneapolis airport Regrets anger and off are just a few inappropriate words were used Also never again
Phoned to enquire to cancel automatic roll over off No one told me you could do this online Staff very unhelpful and rude
When you make a booking its not instantly confirmed Flights has 24hrs to confirm it meaning you can lose the flight youve booked and the new price has gone up I also made a reservation and was charged a fee for choosing my window preference
Useless company do not use I was given a tracking number expected delivery  nothing came on expected date I looked at tracking on line it read  could not access road will deliver next day second day same thing as before same comment On the morning of the 3rd day I rang for an explanation and was told due to the nature of my road a small van was needed indeed my package would be with me and delivered by a small van that day An hour later i checked tracking guess what Could not access road will deliver next day Rang them again very sorry opened a customer complaint file for me and guaranteed it would be with me the following day on a small van by 12 So day 4 driver rang me to tell me he could not access the road as he was in an 8 ton truck would i meet him in town NO Rang TNT again incandescent with rage as driver also told me he had not tried to deliver that week so far and there were no small vans in my area anyway Shouted and swore again at TNT was told they would go to great lengths to get my parcel off the big truck and get a small van to deliver it by 5pm 5 minutes after this a small TNT van arrived and delivered my parcel no knowledge of earlier truck or any communication with depot or complaints So my parcel wasnt even on the drivers truck who rang Do not use this company they are liars and totally incompetent I can only assume every time they said they were ringing the depot to sort out my problem they had me on hold while they had a laugh and a cigarette Wasted 4 days and endless money on phone calls to them had to have a plumber hanging about waiting for the parcel to finish a job and cancelled a day out with my daughter for her birthday to wait in for them I do Live on a narrow road but I have never had anybody else have a problem with delivery or consistently lie at every opportunity Unprofessional and deceitful not to mention appalling service
I will happily post this review on any website I can find and advise my friends and work colleagues never to use TNT
I placed my order on January 102017 still says its been processed I contacted them and they said to either order something in stockWhich the items I ordered says they are in stock daily or wait til feb 25th when they expect to have them back in stock to be shipped I dont think i will be receiving anythingGuess you can only trust fashionmia for an overseas company Months are just crazy to wait for anything to even be order L1701101812242218
So far so good hope all continues to go this way Glenn Karper
wrong Game of thrones books sent law book not deliverd and not reimbursed for since last year
I think the security hold time and the processing time is way to long to hold the donations The whole reason for signing up for the fundraiser was to help a family in need during the loss of a loved one It has been 10 days and the family has still not been able to access funds they were needing to apply towards funeral cost I think the 72 hour security hold should be it and then they should let the beneficiary have immediate access to the donations 10 days after a donation and the status is still showing pending after the donations were suppose to be cashed out is just crazy Next time I may consider other fundraising options to help a family in need because in a critical time of need 2 weeks to wait on funds is not appropriate in my eyes Especially if the contributors had just given cash or even sent it by mail it would have been available sooner then using give a gift
I am hoping for a favourable replacement by the company however at this point unhappy as my printer will not recognise the cartridge As with many printers one colour unhappy and there is no printing happening at all Makes it very hard to do my work

I ordered two dresses One my actual dress size and the other one size larger Hoping that depending on which dress I liked that I would know which size to get However neither dress fit At all Not even close They were about 46 sizes too small When I went to return them I had the option to ship it myself or pay 8 taken from my refund to ship it back Then I the option to get 100 store credit or take 10 off of purchase price for a restocking fee Obviously I wont be purchasing from them again so I took the 10 off of each item for restocking because I didnt want a store credit
Now I have no dress am out 8 in return shipping and 10 from each dress in restocking This totals about 30 I am grossly disappointed The only reason I didnt give one star is because the dresses were cute
I will not order again and do not recommend Prom Girl to anyone

i ordered parts only to not have them ship when expected
when i tried to cancel the order they would not let me
than when they finally did ship they only sent part of the order and said they could not fulfill the complete order
the parts they sent did me no good with out the the other parts
after filing a complaint with paypal and my credit card company they want me to pay shipping to return the parts
be very careful dealing with this company
this is after ordering parts many times from them
I bought a 50 Game code from this company The code they delivered had already been used They charged me 56 including fees initially Had to call them and was met with some guy in a home office with the worst phone connection ever He spent 10 minutes trying to convince me to let him replace the code after I had repeatedly told him that I wanted a refund Finally he honored their guarantee and refunded my purchase through PayPal I would NOT TRUST THIS SITE This was my last experience with this group 110 Would NOT recommend
Probably one of the worst customer service encounters I have ever had No make that the worst Ive complained three times directly by email numerous times on the live chat and there is still no solution to the fact they sent me wool from different dye lots Avoid them like the plague On top of my order having an error the delivery was atrocious both times I bought stuff  awful delivery both in Ireland and UK And the reason for my second order was because the amount of wool suggested for my size project was incorrect
Do not touch with a barge pole Its just a circle of unhelpfulness there
I spoke with a lady on the telephone regarding the return of an item that arrived damaged She was rude and unhelpful She even cut me off while I was talking I ordered a total of 6 pairs of shoes from them I will definitely find a different place to spend my money in the future
I purchased a Trade Tested greenhouse in good faith it would be a product that would be worthy of the 1000 I paid It was not and is basically a load of Chinese rubbish The instructions are misleading the structure is flimsy at best and totally inadequate for what its purpose is  it will blow over with a bit of wind The pieces do not fit it is badly designed and constructed the instructions are useless and the fixings totally inadequate I will need to weld angle iron to the frame to have any hope it will stand up outside Trade Tested are basically a bad company to deal with Firstly from the start i had problems dealing with them  a piece was missing and it took multiple phone calls emails and an enormous amount of my time waiting to get through to customer service to try to resolve the matter and get them to send through the vital missing piece to only find the warranty had expired and because I had opened the box I couldnt send the unit back to get a refund BEWARE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY THEY ARE selling inferior products and there will be no recourse to get your money back A bitter lesson learned Basically a load of rubbish that will have to go to the dump
Dont order from this company I never received my order and neither did most people that have ordered from them

I did a ton of research before going with White Jacobs I really felt like they would be able to do like they assured me they would I worked with Doug Taylor and he told me my credit file was nothing out of the ordinary and we should have no problems getting great results It took some time but he was able to get some things removed I was able to purchase a car but soon after  several of the deleted collections reappeared on my reports to drop my scores even lower than they were when I hired them I left a review on the BBB asking for a refund or partial and was told it was my fault for having high credit card balances My CCs are paid off and have been for 2 months My scores are still in the mid 400s Its embarrassing Lack of communication from Doug became very frustrating towards the end I had to message them on Facebook to have him return my calls or emails I know people have had great results with them For whatever reason my deletions have reappeared and they wont help after 6 months I offered to continue paying as long as it takes At this point  they should refund my money Ive been pretty quiet hoping for someone to reach out and do the right thing but this is the first of many reviews White Jacobs  do the right thing My credit is complete and utter garbage They will only respond with how they were able to get many deletions but dont address it when they reappear and drop your scores even further than before Sad
Next day delivery didnt get for 3 days
I received countless errors when trying to order my merchandise online Made it very inconvenient
Hidden fees  I ended up paying double
Ive made up a budget to get a hotel so they seem to fit my price range After I booked the hotel room they insert all kinds of hidden fees When i did the booking i already payed 30 more in fees than the advertised price
I got to the hotel and i was pushed to pay even more fees What do they provide for all these fees I ended up paying double than my budget I just want to know the price per night before i book anything and before i get to the hotel If Im looking to get a 60 room and i end up paying 120 is a huge difference Thats not my price range This is Unacceptable Such liars

So far our experience with American Freight has not been good we bought a couch  love seat and it was delivered damaged they said they would replace it they brought another one out with the same problem Its been over a month and still no replacement I think we are getting the stall tactic and run around
A very clear proposal by a saler about using energia to pay less electricity wasnt true at all
Now I pay more than before and that only can make me feel dissapointed of this conpany
You will get a fair deal but sometimes the people you deal with do not know how to respect those who they come in contact with Very easy process minus the appraisers own personal comments about how the car was treated over its life span which was not needed nor appreciated We know the car was not in good shape and thats why it was taken to you so dont give people a lecture about driving like a 17 year old teen Just way to blunt and disrespectful
Ive used Pure Formulas for a little over 3 years For the first 18 months I received my products at a good price and had no problem with the automated delivery
After the initial period however the automated delivery just stopped It showed up on my account but the products never shipped I called to inquire and was assured the products were shipping the next day But they ever did My card on file was also not charged Last week about a year and a half after auto delivery vanished I logged back into the account and cancelled the auto ship The account still read my next shipment was scheduled for over a year ago
When I cancelled the autoship I made a new purchase just a onetime purchase Today after 7 days and the order not being shipped it was an estimated delivery of 57 days I called to inquire After a long wait for a person at customer service I was told that they could not order an expedited replacement until a total of 7 business days had passed Since I ordered on a Friday and inquired on a Friday they could not take action until the following Wednesday 11 days after ordering If I did not receive the unshipped order by Wednesday I was welcome to call back for a replacement And no there was no way to automate shipping the order but the customer service rep offered to put a sticky note on her computer to check the account and if I had not received the unshipped order in 2 additional business days from Friday today to Wednesday next week she would call me
So no I wont be placing any more orders with Pure Formulas Too many problems with their supply chainshipping and order process Much easier to order elsewhere
Dont go in this house An ignoble smell when you enter the house disgusting cooking impossible to cook really a very bad experience
I recently saw some flights from London to South Africa on last minutecom approx 2400 for family of 4 and started chatting to an online adviser who offered to call me if I wanted to proceed with the booking When he did we spent about 3040 minutes on the phone he took all my credit card details names dates of birth passport numbers for the whole family ran through the flight details very carefully etc and I assumed that the deal was done and the tickets were in the bag Later that night I got a text telling me to check my email and when I did my heart sank Not only was it from Bravo Fly who I had read horror stories about previously I hadnt realised they own the Last Minute group but it just said something along the lines of due to a technical error your booking request has been cancelled No explanation no attempt to try again no offer of alternative flights etc So bizarre And to say that it was just a booking request not an actual booking Why would they not try to sort out the problem I think the flights which admittedly were a good price maybe too good to be true were never actually available at that price  but I still dont understand why they would waste my and their time over something that didnt exist Just relieved that I hadnt immediately booked connecting flights car hire etc after booking Beware booking flights with this company
Google inset came and are not remotely close to the prescription I gave them

I purchased a 40 bouquet of flowers  orange and pink gerberas premium dark pink roses and green chrysanthemums for my mothers birthday the flowers arrived after the allotted time of before 1400 hrs and my mother called me to let me know I asked if she liked them and she said she wasnt impressed as Id picked a fabulous looking bouquet I was shocked She sent me a photo of the flowers and they were completely different to the ones I ordered and were quite frankly not worth 5  1 gerbera some tiny pale pink roses carnations and lots of other battered poor quality random unidentifiable flowers and leaves Floraqueen refuse to give me a refund and say the flowers are of comparable quality I know flowers may vary but to deliver a completely different arrangement bulked out with carnations and bits of greenery is unbelievable

When I received my order it was damaged I unboxed my easy vape 5 digital and set it up according to instructions I found on youtube The heating element did not heat up and glow red I inspected the unit to find a hairline Crack in the heating element I called Vape Nation immediately to report it and get a solution I was told that I would have to ship it back it would be inspected and either repaired or replaced I was told that it would take about 2 days for a shipping label to be emailed to me then when It arrives at Vape Nation it could be a couple of weeks before they could send another or the repaired item I have still not gotten an email with a shipping label and have an item that is useless to me I am very disappointed in the service from Vape Nation I feel like I am now out the money I spent have a useless product  have been disregarded in any attempt to make this right

We booked three nights in a hostel through hostelworld yesterday and today found out they overcharge by over 80 euros This is unacceptable Also when we were booking we thought we may need to cancel due to potential date changes and we read that Cancellations and changes of your booking are free of charge up to 48 hours prior to arrival which led us to believe cancellation was possible We tried to cancel after finding how much wed overpaid but were told then that our deposit was nonrefundable Rip off do not book with hostel world
Because of a small mistake they ruined a supposedly nice Valentine gift
but because simply they are stupid and rude and they care only about their money they dealt with it so unprofessionally
you have to wait for an email to know if the vehicle is even availible they should know that when they display it on the website now we have bought our flight tickets so if its not availible we are in deep sh fingers crossed

Will never purchase an item from them that needs to be delivered I was told that the delivery was an additional charge which is fine
70 for a delivery 6 miles away is ridiculous but I was aware of that I was not aware until 10 mins prior to delivery the notice I received that I needed cash Of course this fee does not include assembly and they forgot the metal frame To tell me I need to be home and have cash in 10 mins is ridiculous
Once i placed i had to contact customer service only way to get your order but anyway once i was in game the person trading me the gold said i had to give him my phone number among other personal details before he would trade me I told customer support about the situation they said to ignore the gamer and that there was some sort of issue and to try again later I put in a paypal dispute even with screenshots i had needless to say i didnt get my money back I even contacted them on facebook and was meet up with a rude person that was no help at all I would stay away from this site id try your luck elsewhere to be safe
Good low fares Recommended for sure
FlightHub worst website to book Airline tickets on NO after sales servicesNever going to book any of my flights here and will not recommend it to anyoneHad to call almost 15 times in 4 days to reschedule flight because flights are available but their system wont work when system works call drops while I am on hold even though they ask for a call back no they never call back so you talk to a new agent every timeAfter all this I am told to either call 10 days prier to when I wish to fly and they will see if they can reschedule my return flight OR pay for a new return ticket I am told by agents that tickets are available but sustem wont allow rescheduling How is that my fault Worst After Sales Services

i recently had a package lost at a purolator depot very frusterationg experience very little customer care support it was a long process finally got it figured out replacement delivery is now delayed in transit again for a week DO NOT USE PUROLATOR THEY ARE HORRIBLE
This was definitely not worth the money I cant tell a difference in my back pain at all and could have gotten a more comfortable bed for much less money
Its also a scam to say it can be returned in 90 days because you have to get it in the original packaging which was vacuum sealed so there is literally no way you can return it
Scam 46 seconds later and would not change flight under 500cost Or 300 to cancell
Brutal No help Never book with these scsmmers
works ok does not work on glossy surfaces as advertised

Purchased a open box drone from Beach Camera Add claimed to be inspected and 100 functional Drone was delivered within a few days and upon receipt I opened the box with excitement As I pulled the drone from the backpack container I noticed the camera hanging by its wires I inspected the drone further and found one of the landing struts to be broke in two places I called Beach and the first thing they asked was had I crashed the drone The Fed Ex man was just leaving I powered on the drone and tried to fire up the motors which failed and the drone went into a error mode I finally opened the propeller box to find 3 of the 6 propellers broke The point being that they did not even open this thing up after the original owner crashed it and returned it I then offered to buy a new drone and have them refund the difference The answer I got was our system does not work that way I was not very happy with my experience with Beach Camera They did send a prepaid label to send it back Be very careful with their open box items

hi upon arriving home yesterday and opening my purchase of large 4x4 car cover i felt very concerned about the material that the cover is made off as i have purchased 1 cover from local K mart store for 2995 which broke down and crumbled into rubbish after only 2 months i returned it they replaced it with another which lasted approx the same time they accepted the unit and gave me a refund  looking at my new cover the material looks the same as the crap ones from k mart when i looked at your cover online it looked like a different material ie the turret and bonnet material was different to the sides much the same as the cover on my caravan which has lasted just on 4 years and only just starting to fail but back to my new cover what warranty has the cover i pick your cover from a large listing on e bay but i now have reservations if i made a bad choice should i return the cover for a refund or can you please offer me your opinion awaiting your reply before i put feed back on ebay and approach pay pal thanks mal
I was committed 200 dollars for the call but after the call your executive offered only 100 dollars as a tip of courtesy and said your company cannot pay me anything and this 100 dollars was also a gesture of tip like I am a beggar who came to you Your Client wanted to know direct questions about my current employer which initially your executive said I can refuse and that was precondition for me to accept the offer but after the call she told me that the company cannot pay me as I refused to answer questions about the my company Very unethical unprofessional and cheatful experience Will never ever entertain your offers Disgusting and disgraceful
I would not recommend EZ Storage to anybody that I know You did not honor the one dollar for your first month because I had to upgrade to a larger unit I went in on a Friday to secure everything for the following day move in and because of that and needing to upgrade to a larger unit It did not only cost me the difference between the two units but I also lost the one dollar for the month which meant that my move into EZ storage ended up costing me almost 200 of unexpected money Highly dissatisfied We pull out as quickly as possible
inconsistencies between words of various employees very very skeptical of their entire operation
I booked a trip and misclicked the month for the return flight I called the customer care immediately  charging me 5 euros They promised multiple options as solutions Within 1 hour I received two emails saying that any changes to the bookings are impossible but if I still want to change I can call again And of course charge me 5 euros again for nothing Bravofly is a scam
Nie wieder
Your survey was way too short to tell about the booking experience that is why I do it here Also nobody cant find Your email address Put it on Your sites please
I booked our trip several months before the trip During that time there
happened several changes with the flights I understand the changes may have been made by airline companies but they caused us a lot of trouble My original choice was morning flight from Phu Quoc to Bangkok via Saigon with good transfer time One change was that the second flight was before the first one had landed How is that possible What is Your role here I assume You as a company between a customer and the flying company had noticed this is impossible Do You only forward customers the information airline companies
send You like a machine
One phase was that I suddenly saw in Checkmytrip that there was something like flight twoway and not us I booked
After my first booking I got the etickets as it should be but not the last tickets before I phoned an expensive phonecall to You Then I got the tickets in my mail The same officer said we dont have to take out and move our luggage in Saigon The truth was that Vietnam Airlines dont move them They simply dont do that The officer said 1h 45 minutes is minimum transfer time in Saigon and our final schedule is ok After the changes we had 1h40m That is not enough in Saigon I can tell
I am sorry to tell You all this I have a lot more pleasant experiences with other companies Travelgenio as a middleman between airline companies and a customer should serve the customer no matter what the airline company does And email adress on sites is essential

I just placed my order yesterday on 12 feb 2017 then I proceeded and paid with my credit card directly the amount was deducted from my card and i believe it was already transferred to them  then i got an email from them today asking for a photo of my credit card to be sent via email 
I found this request kind of tricky and scary because for the past 4 years i have been buying from internet and this is the first time i have been asked for such a thing i wish i can cancel this order and get refunded to save my time and money
Despite being the conditions advertised they dont process the not used fuel In my case occurred every time twice 34 of the fuel more than 50
When trying to contact the client Support the site doesnt link to the reservation and doesnt accept the creation of an occurrence
Goldcar answer here is unfortunately deceiving never asked for diesel and confirms that no refund on the fuel was processed as should have been in the flexfuel policy
Great
Signed me into a new contract without speaking to me firsteven after requesting a call
Plants arrived in a timely manner in good shap but with very little roots Out of the ten ordered last year only two survived Those trees also had very little roots off the tap root Even irrigating them had poor results Decided to give it one more try
My first time using LensFactory and probably the last After two weeks of sending my frames in with no contact from them whatsoever I called in on a Friday to get an update and they told me there was an issue with my lenses and that they had to start over so theyll rush it and send it out by midfollowing week That didnt happen I called in again the following Friday and they said its not ready yet Its been a month now and I have no idea whats happening with my frames or how long its gonna take They never bother to call me with any updates to keep me posted Its always me calling them and their excuse is always generic with no actual details about my order I still dont have my frames back as we speak I would not recommend these guys
Very slow service Courier Dpex has shocking customer service and were of no assistance Items took 7 days from Sydney to Mudgee
Well I bought a product and had to get through a phone security check  which failed two times and after that nothing I have no idea whats happening with my order its just processing and you cant even send an email to support since after you hit the Send Button there is only a loading window for several minutes and nothing happens
So I have no idea when or if I get my game after the unsucessful phone security or whatsoever Kinda annoyed how this is working right now
We ordered via Bolcom some articles One of the parcels was send by DPD Netherlands towards Belgium
Delivery date on the 17th of januari was not possible because their driver was too busy So I called the helpdesk and agreed that delivery will take place on friday the 20th January Because that was the only day someone was home
On Thursday the 19th there was a note in the mailbox that they tried deliver it but nobody was home OFCOURSE THAT IS WHY I AGREED WITH DPD it had to be delivered on FRIDAY the 20th and not thursday de 19th
They also requested it we would pick it up ourselves now
We do not have a car that is why we order online
So my girlfriend to the DPD parcel shop to pick it up by bike She could not carry the box by bike so had to unpack the items and put it in a bag She was not allowed to even leave the empty box over there Totally no service at all
They where also unfriendly at the parcel shop
I advice NOT TO use services of DPD anymore Use DHL or Postnl instead
Advertised as a 1 minute photobook I saw this offer on groupon i decided to take it It took me more than 1 minute to get all the pictures loaded in the serverside application but that was to be expected had about 2500 Hi Res pictures to load After some changing of pictures we had about the desired result I took the option of a glossy cover had no option for better paper so i thought it would have been good quality didnt mind the back advertising for resnap if its a good product people can see  Ordered  payed
2 days later i received a mail there were some issue with the quality of the pictures but they can fix it if they get the original pictures through WE Transfer Replied if they could be more specific because i was in no mood to upload 25 gigabytes of pictures So they send me the specific list of the pictures used in the album It seemed they all were there all 297 of themapplication issue Allready tempted to kill the order I thought let me upload them if they have the original files it can only benefit the quality So i Uploaded about 4 gb of pictures  passed them the links
Within days they contacted me that the book is in production  then it was shipped off provided a tracking link
The book itself It looks nice with the glossy cover but when opened and watching the pictures in detail its bad
Have no other word for it pictures look pixelated its like that the paper moved while printing I have made some photobooks before this one is by all means the worst one The picture quality in newspapers are better
My advise Dont bother there are much cheaper alternatives for better quality Advertised as a 1 minute photobook took me about 3 hrs alone to upload  filter all the pictures afterwards
Conclusion Waste of time  money
Extremelly expensive shipping costs for light and low volume articles
I havent received the CONTACTS lense Delivery date should be February 7 2017 I called their Customer service  spoke to supervisormanager VICTORIA last February 82017 She told me that she will call the UPS  UPS will give me a call Since then no calls from OPTICONTACTS and UPS
I hope their going to replace the contacts IT WAS NOT MY FAULT IF THE CONTACTS WAS NOT DELIVERED NO APOLIGIZE FROM THE CUSTOMER REF AND SUPERVISORMANAGER VICTORIA SO VERY INCONVENIENT
WILL REPORT TO BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU
I paid extra for fast shipmentbut never received the contacts Called and they had to reasonable explanation and refused to refund my money This site is surely a scam be careful dont deal with them
Living in Mallorca and meeting tourists all the time I have heard all the horror stories about Goldcar and until recently had never had the misfortune to use them myself
Unfortunately I made a booking for a recent trip to Barcelona with my girlfriend through a 3rd party website Doyouspaincom and didnt notice until it was too late that we had been saddled with Goldcar
And I knew we would be in for a bumpy ride because I had accidentally booked the car for one day less than we needed From their reputation I knew we were going to get screwed but even I hadnt envisaged quite how terrible the experience would be
Of course our first contact was with the 3rd party company within hours of making the booking They told us it was impossible to cancel or make any amendments as we had a special offer and there was no price we could pay to have the car for one more day not because it wasnt available but because those are the rules Next we spoke to the Goldcar customer service centre Same response They advised that upon collection of the car we enquire with the airport desk about taking the car for the extra day I didnt hold out much hope for this approach but I didnt want to write off the entire cost of the booking and go with another company without at least trying
We knew we were in the wrong as far as their rules go so we didnt go in guns blazing In fact we had made a very conscious plan of how to deal with it Both my girlfriend and I have both previously worked in customer services including call centres and are very sensitive in our approach when on the other end of things Furthermore she speaks fluent Spanish and Catalan so we thought it would be helpful for her do the talking and conduct everything in the native language of the Goldcar staff
We were immediately and firmly told it was not possible to make any change and there was no amount of money that would allow it Well that was somewhat to be expected So a change of tack what is the penalty for late return of a vehicle if circumstances dont allow us to return it on time Dont do it we were told sharply This exchange of yes but if someone brings a vehicle back late for whatever reason and dont do it went on for some time At no point were we asking for any Goldcar representative to condone bringing the car back late we just wanted to know what the policy of our contract was Its as reasonable a thing to ask as what the insurance excess is for breaking a wingmirror and surely must be in the contract but apparently we were not allowed to know
The staff member had been rude and defensive from the very beginning and at some point midconversation wondered off to another customer who incidentally was irate about some other issue that I didnt quite catch He left us in the hands of a monosyllabic woman who had been sat there the whole time with her face buried in her computer and we were led to understand that that was the end of any further dialogue and now it was time for the paperwork After some grunting and keyboard tapping she instructed me to put my card in the machine which informed me they wanted 230 Euros from me
Is this for the extra day I asked
No for fuel and insurance
I dont require the extra insurance because I already have a separate annual policy for hire cars
It doesnt matter you have to take our insurance
For the previous week Doyouspain had been emailing me to advise me to take their insurance as it would be cheaper than buying it at the pickup location but luckily I didnt do it as I already had my own policy and it transpired that if I had have taken it Goldcar would have apparently forced me to take theirs anyway
At this point a 3rd customer had entered the office and was having an argument about some other issue with the guy we were originally speaking with and I decided to cut my losses and go to a different company
Of course I lost all the money I originally paid and never even saw the car I had paid for but even after having to go with another company at the last minute at the airport which is undoubtedly normally the least economical way of doing things we ended up with paying less than Doyouspain Goldcars hidden charges and thats not even considering whatever they would have fined us for the late return  which they never did reveal The lady at the Sixt desk we went to was basically everything the staff of Goldcar were not and I know where my business will be going in the future
My initial disappointment with the experience after making an error with the booking has effectively become redundant Even if that mistake hadnt have happened wed still have been faced with a 230 euro bill upon collecting the car when we were fully under the impression that the booking was complete with Doyouspain in advance On top of which the staff were defensive rude and deliberately unhelpful although from what I have heard about the company previously and from what I personally witnessed with every other customer in the 20odd minutes I was in their office I can start to sympathise with their situation as it must be very difficult working for a company with such levels of customer dissatisfaction
In conclusion if it seems to good to be true then it almost certainly is Never again
When renewing the multi trip the visa card had changed You had to phone couldnt alter that online Then the health questions against the partner who is on what most people are on at that age Couldnt answer so phoned up the health number who they off shute this too They decided it was going to cost an additional 250 this year Err Then said could remove one condition Its still about the same What about removing both conditions No additional cost They were keen to take the money until we wanted to drop the additional conditions then it was back to the main number being a Sunday closed
So clearly the additional medical insurance people who have those average conditions for that age are scammed and the insurance is wacked up The guy on the phone could have said no additional cost if you exclude those conditions or with the conditions 250 extra He didnt
Going to look around next year since the basic insurance premium shot up and all of this was on expensive telephone numbers So not happy
I ordered many times flowers with floraqueen But so bad for a birthday and for a Valentines Day they were not able to deliver on time And  no answer to email difficult to find phone number they sold you flowers but no follow up So better choose another website  Very very poor service

I called 2 times because I didnt know my dress size for a particular dress on the website and the lady I talked to told me Im exactly a size 12 both times I called Im normally a size four or six and she insisted that I get a twelve and I did exactly what she said I tried on the dress and it was extremely large Not to mention it was expensive and it had been picked on the inside of the bust and there were stains on it The lady was going to charge me a restocking fee to send it back however we worked it out and in the end she said she would refund the money and send me a return label so I wouldnt have to pay the extra fees Overall the size chart is not correctly proportioned so if your going to order a dress from prom girl order your normal size
They tried to deceive me and take my money after they lied to me first about item availability then about shipping options and last they sent me a FAKE tracking number They still making excuses but all they want is to take my money and I get nothing
I also have to mention that they dont accept negative reviews they will not show your review on a product if its negative
Go away people dont buy from banggood please dont let the low prices and fake reviews fool you as happened with me I regretted buying from there
I love my rubber stamp It exceeded my expectations
Ordered two fences and clips for a Frigidaire dishwasher rack First delivery missing one fence and all clips Second order received 2nd fences and only one package of clips Its was supposed to be two fences and two packages of clips They told me to do what ever with the first order with no clips Finally I said lets cancel everything and Ill return all items for a full refund That process of refund took 5 weeks and 67 phone calls to get refund after they had proof of tracking refund They constantly blame their supplier and have very poor control of their order process as they will not do anything with their customer service in a timely manner for continual order errors AVOID

I have literally spent about 10 hours on the phone with O2 trying to sort out my dead internet connection Wating times of 45 minutes or more Customer service rep hanging up on me because I did not have my Kundennummer even though O2s online Rechnung service was down so I could not get login to view my customer number Every customer service rep deals with a problem differentlyso you never now if you will get helped or not
Bottom line is that O2 customer service to put it politely sucks One CSR rep openly admitted that with the merger with O2 and Eplus they laid off too many CSR reps and underestimated the workloadthat is why you have to 45 minutes minumum to get anyone on the phone
I was thrilled at the price I was Quote d for the rental car out of Dublin airport The cost for 11 days was equivalent to what I have paid for one day in another country But I knew from previous experience that when I get there the agent will try to insist that my credit card insurance does not cover CDW in Ireland it does and when I insist he will tack on an extra charge for NOT taking insurance However in addition to these annoyances reading the fine print before booking I learned that the agency at Dublin airport would charge an additional 30 Euro for the privilege of getting the car at the airport rather than downtown This essentially doubles the cost But worse was yet to come When I made the booking regardless of this highway robbery in the fine print on the confirmation I learned that there would be a SECOND 30 Euro charge added at the airport essentially tripling the cost There was no reasonable explanation for this second booking charge except greed
All of this would have been known to Rentalcarscom and should have been prominently displayed at the time of booking so an informed decision whether to accept this highway robbery could be made
Cost were overpriced Not a large selection of options Not any good service
I ordered flowers to be delivered to my grandmother I put her neighbors address down by mistake but when she went to her neighbors house to ask about a delivery the flowers werent there They sent a confirmation that they had been delivered around noon that day and there was no delivery at all to any of the neighbors in the area The site does not give a lot of feedback or information about your delivery and customer service is nill Ive called several times and the times that I have gotten through I was put on hold for about a half hour
i recently opened an account with ozlotteries only to find out that if your outside australia they will even charge more almost double the amount then if you sign in as inside australia this is kinda discriminating i mean whats the difference its not like theyre puting extra charge if a foreigner buy from them the ticket price is double yes double and i feel really really like a 2nd degree human about this that some people pay x amount from their site and me from the same site same service same everything i have to pay double am ready to give out my details if ozlotteries wants to check my account no prob with that but still why

I got all these boxes delivered to me with barely any instructions of putting together the bed I had to keep calling the store for the run around to get some instructions It was a frustrating process took me two days before I could get proper instructions on putting my bedroom set together One of the associated insulted me by saying use some muscle I was highly upset because I dont put beds together for a living so it was quite difficult to know when it barely came with any instructions and some of the main parts of the bed was hidden behind the headboard I had to keep calling to find that out My experience was not that great hopefully they do better next time
did a purchase they offer me a coupon for a review after I did it the coupon I got is useless since it does not work with the item I want to buy now and the worst part is they say they dont understand why I keep asking because the product they sell has no profit  really Unbelievable
What they claimed to have fixed is still not working and charged me over 400 00

 And for the record  dont believe anything that you read on trust pilot  it is a paid review service  paid for by the company subscribing to their service  Product Review is impartial and google reviews as well 
Updated as per Eddys reply  Hi Eddy  this seams like this is the only way we can communicate on Trustpilot  As you say you have spent a fair bit of time going back and forth  How disappointing  And as you say  Frustrating  that no one from Australian Solar Quote s can pick up the phone and sort out any communication frustrations quickly  Maybe ASQ are in Australia  maybe overseas  maybe Bots replying  Makes it Hard to build up Rapport

I first tasted Smokehouse at my daughters house when she had a whole smoked turkey and it was wonderful I ordered what I thought was a boneless turkey breast but when we received it it had a large bone in the middle  not a turkey bone and it was full of scraps to include fat and turkey parts I would normally throw away and did this time too We only had a small amount of edible turkey Very disappointed

I ordered what I thought was a pair of blue jeans and a shirt It took months to arrive which I expected as I checked other peoples reviews When I finally received my items the jeans were actually a pair of cheaply made tights with picturesome of pockets instead of real ones Even the fly was just a insure on the tights to try to look like a button and zipper The shirt was also very thin flimsy material Very cheaply made Not to mention the sizing is for only very petite women Most of it says one size fits all maybe if by all you mean all children I would NEVER order anything from here again Very disappointing since the clothing in the pictures looks so nice
I asked for a product availability and they told me that his supplier have it in stock

This was the absolute worst experience ever The warranty company is not customer friendly We asked for an afternoon pick up so we would not have to take off work they scheduled it from 930 am to 130 pm My husband had to take off work They said they would reschedule for a 25 fee We never even agreed to that schedule The company acted like we were trying to rip them off by using the warranty
I ordered for Valentine a large pastel color bouquet for 63 euros but what was delivered to my girlfriend looked totally different in composition choice of flowers colors and numbers Clearly you cannot rely on Euroflorist and I deeply regret having spent that much for the cheap supermarket like bouquet she received 30 euros worth maximum Ive sent an email and pictures to complain and show the discrepancy for Euroflorist to investigate with their local partner but nobody dared to reply to me Its been a very disappointing experience and next time I will rely on a local boutique flower shop like I do in France to get the quality Im paying for
Tried to change day on my reservation I called them 5 min after the booking I was to fast to press buy and realized I wrote the wrong day
After a long talk about non refundable bookings that didnt show on the site they says Give us i in writing from the hotel that they can change day for you and well might help you
I did and called them back They asked me to send the mail to them I did Havent heard from them after that I gave up and will never use their services again
I ordered a multimeter it arrived fastly with one very loose probe the other one was good The probe had 04Ohms resistance in comparison to a very cheap one from another multimeter So current measurement would be dangerous I explained the problem and provided a picture that clearly showed the crooked cutout of the probe The support wanted a video which I provided then the support wanted another explanation After some messages they said this is was working as intended and there is nothing I can do
I was hoping they would resend me a probe since the original one cost 8  shipping from the official distributor but they did not So I went for 250 probes from Aliexpress out of my own pocket and after 4 weeks I finally had a working multimeter
I guess I am lucky I did not order an expensive phone or similar
why is there extra costs
email sent but no one bother to reply
I have been a loyal customer of blinds2go purchasing more than 8 conservatory blinds over the last few years The grab handles are made of cheap plastic and break very easily Blinds2go offer 3 year warrenty on products I contacted their customer service and complained and asked for replacements They found my previous orders but could not find my recent order on their system and since I have moved house I did not retain the order number so there curt response is sorry we cannot help you Is this the mark of a customer focused company and do they deserve your business  I think not

The person who sold me my bedroom suite and living room furniture informed me in the store that it would take one week to deliver my bedroom suite However one week turned into three and a half weeks The store representativeworker did not contact me about the continued delays in delivery but rather I had to contact the store each week to request an update Additionally there was a communication about what a bedroom suite included was changed between what was communicated in facility overthephone and the actual product that was delivered
I ordered flower for St Valentine day and Im still waiting them to be delivered I called their customer services the only answer was a recorded message all representatives are busy please wait Waited for about 10 minutes the recording came back asking to leave phone number and they will me back Keyed my number and to confirmed pressed 1 and at that time the system said feature not available at this time goodbye Called back but this time decided to select order I got an immediate live response to take my order When I attempted to explain why I was calling they switched me back to customer services and the same response I explained above happened again Send a text message no response Send an email and I received a reply they will review the email within 5 days Still no flowers delivered To all this when I used the purchase order number to track it the response This order scheduled to be delivered today  not further update has been posted The only thing that would satisfy me will be the REFUND
Purchased the Bradford Chocolate Sectional and in less than a year the arm rests started to pull apart The material seems very thin and cheap in certain areas It has pulled apart in numetous areas now I have now been waiting for over 6 months for a promised replacement I worked with Dajuan sp the manager in the Tampa FL store Every time I would call and leave a message he would not call back I had to keep calling and emailing him trying to find out what was going on I was told for about 3 months now they are waiting for the replacement from the manufacturer I just want my recliner sofa replaced with a quality piece or offer me something similar This is ridiculous
My sister bought me a pair of Fabletics leggings a year ago and I still love them I saw the promotion for the 2 pairs for 2499 and I figured I would look around I am an XS and the most frustrating thing I found was that the site had no option for me to choose a filter so that I only saw the XS that were available Instead I had to click on each pair of leggings individually just to be disappointed over and over because there was NO XS I found a total of 3 leggings that were available in my size I understand they are on sale but I would prefer to not have to click on every single image to search my size
I was definitely overcharged Normally replacement turn signal light bulbs come in a package of 2 I received one for the price of 2 in a packsge plus some
I will not be a repeat customer as I feel I was taken for granted I am surprised Amazon has them on there list as a potential supplier

Very happy with products and pricing but following up phone calls regarding delivery was very poor

They havent delivered the product and the client service dont answer the phone and rarely emails
My negative review doesnt concern the Oak Furnitureland company they have extremely nice customer service reps or the product itself its the delivery company they contract with MXD
It took MANY phone calls on my part to coordinate our delivery
The date OFL gave me was not the one MXD seemed to be aware of After a call when I was able to schedule a date through an automated process they were unable to make the delivery but failed to contact me I had to again contact them questioning why I had received the nightbefore call
When I called they made me feel that I was wrong luckily I had an email confirming the date and said they could not possibly make that date and it had to be changed As it turns out the item had been put on the wrong truck
Whenever I called MXD I was consistently on hold for 2030 mintues before anyone would take the call then would be switched around between people One time I was put on hold for another 20 min and the girl was surprised I was still there when she picked up the phone I truely think she was hoping I had hung up
The customer service MXD showed was unbelievably horrible All they needed to do was to stay in touch with me and let me know the problems they were encountering But no one did I may not have been happy that the delivery ended up being 3 weeks late but would have appreciated the customer service
The day of the delivery went fine The gentlemen were nice and took the cabinet up to a second floor room which was quite a struggle
Truthfully I will question ordering from OFL again not because of the company or products but because I do not want to go through the delivery struggle again

The worst mobile network ever They take advantage of you if you are not a native German speaker Once they started deducting 40 Euros per month just like that I couldnt find the reason and called them again and again around 10 times till I get someone whom I could speak with English He also didnt know the reason and promised me to adjust that in the next bill What he did was just changed the contract and paying 25 Euros instead of 40I really wanted to sue them but I dont know how Someone please help me
I have never seen such a greedy mobile network ever Please never opt for this network if you are not a German speaker
PS They call occasionally for useless data and other offers I told them I have no interest in their offers still they deducted around 7 Euros for two months Now I cut the call whenever it is from Mobilcom debitel

I ordered a wheelchair from this company because of the quality price and 12 day shipping The quality and price were good but the shipping took 5 business days to get started instead of the 12 days advertised on their website

They should change their website to be more accurate

21 546  I order seat covers from Motoquipe on ebay
21 554  I change my mind bc I dont want to wait for AU shipping and request to cancel
21 614  No response yet so I put in a second order to cancel
24  Check my ebay and see that they have claimed the order was already sent On 21 Between the order and cancellation time 8 min apart
24 217  I msg motoquipe on ebay requesting an explanation
28  Package delivered but not left with me because no one was home to sign
214  I drive to post office and pick up package Still no word from Motoquipe
215  I track package and find that it was shipped 23 two full days after my two cancellation requests So they ignored the cancellation request as well as my request for explanation just to make the 100 or so off the seat covers
Buyer beware they are out for themselves and do not have a concern for customer service
I was already frustrated by the postage taking so long but this was the fault of the UK postal service not the sender but then had to pay an extra fee for the glasses this should have already been accounted for They were helpful when I enquired about my item but I do not appreciate hidden charges

Never received the product but payment was taken in advance hope they refund my money back or give me my producta unhappy disgruntled customer
 1 STER IS AL TEVEEL
I have ordered from Blinds2Go twice the 1st time the blind had been cut so the pattern had a blank 2 space on the right side and they had cut through the pattern on the left side  it looked ridiculous and after a few emails they replaced it free of charge with a blind with a central pattern so a happy ending at their expense
The 2nd time I ordered a plain blind and all was fine
I then ordered 2 x patterened blinds and emailed to say please can they make sure the pattern is central and this is their response
I have tried to contact you this morning and unfortunately was unable to get through so I left a voicemail We would not be able to centralise the pattern in the middle as this would be difficult as we are unaware where the pattern would be cut once in the manufacturing process However what we would be able to do is pattern match the blind this would be an additional 10 per blind This would not be a wall paper finish but would ensure the pattern is consistent on the way up If you can please give us a call on the number below so we can take payment and proceed with the order
Bit confusing so I called them and was told they just take the next cut on the material to save costs and it would probably come out okHowever if I want to make sure the pattern is central it would cost me an extra 10 on the order price
I find this an incredibly sloppy way to run a business and would imagine most people would be unhappy with their order being made this way
I have cancelled my order and have found a local reliable friendly company who now have my money and my order

I bought tickets to a concert for twice the amount they were worth
The website did not allow cancellation
Then on the printout of the ticket the price shown was a lot less than what they were worth
Absolute rip off 
I was very excited about this store when I found it on line but after my purchase was dissapointed because I spent 50 on a toy and it wasnt what my son had asked for but since it was a surprise I couldnt have him see it online He opened it and realized it wasnt real cases and asked me to return it The toy was totally unused new the only thing we removed was the plastic The store didnt want to exchange the toy for another one of course I wont be buying from them in the future
I ordered a summer dress for my girlfriend now is almost winter and they still have not even ship it out I ordered it by the app and did not read the customer feedback about this website before I place the order Luckily I only spent USD2000 on it Now I know those Chinese are not trustable and I can kind of guess I have to fight for my life to get that 2000 back Everyone wish me good luck for getting my refund and DO NOT SHOP IN THIS WEBSITE
All your units are too small and way too expensive and I am not going to pay that its robbery
I was totally disappointed in their services The only thing they provided me was the name of a company that provided services in my area They gave me wrong phone numbers told me my application was accepted when it was not told me to make a payment when I could not application had not been accepted told me to expect phone calls which never came Im very disappointed If they did their job well they could provide a helpful resource in the confusing mess of insurance As it was they only further muddied the already cloudy water They get a 2  5 stars as only 1 customer service person was helpful and greatly appreciated

I looked online and checked prices theirs seemed competitive so I booked Then I got an email saying booking needs immediate action so I called them and they said my booking has need cancelled Okay no big deal right But the charges are STILL ON MY CREDIT CARD Dont use this airline booking service the good reviews are fake They rip ppl off and theres no way to make them pay you back STAY AWAY
Each time I get contacts there are some defective lenses Last time I contacted the company and they replaced them This batch I had 11 defective lenses I sent an e mail to the company and never heard back I probably wont continue to use OptiContactscom
Manuka factor10 as shown on the picture of the product was nt the same product received
No reaction on my correspondence so far
Would not recommend Webcom for small start up business
Purchaced a bamboo bong that leaks I sent request and just got numerous auto reply mails with no direction for return or refund Im going to back charge this piece of junk And customer service All they had to do was give me directions to return item  My request got passed to 3 or 4 people with same auto reaponse Crap company
I was so excited to finally get the product When I opened the box the smell almost knocked me out It smelled like cooked lambvery strong odor To strong to wash out It is unusable I wasted my money
Paid the extra full insurance under the impression it would lower the deposit amount needed on the credit card only to find out immediately after booking that the rental car company required the full deposit which is higher than my credit allowance meaning ill have to pay the higher amount at the company double insuring myself
Its been 3 weeks and still no items I contacted customer service to have them tell me they do not track shipments undwer 10000 I did not get a response after sending message through paypal
Order has been paid for then they dont have it back order till who knows
it was a nice service but since some weeks there email server is bugged as hell email delay from 560 mins
But 1 week every day contact to support and no one cares about your problem
And i have friends that use namecheap too and have all the same probs but support only say everything is fine
Never again i was customer for 2 Years but now i search for new one
I sent my card and hadnt heard anything til i reached out on the last day of their turnaround time I was then told my card wasnt the same value i originally stated which was inaccurate However i was left no option but to comply my alternative was to wait for it to be returned and i feared the card would have no value by then Unpleasant experience
Bad company Will never do business with company or associates
I had bought from them through EBay an Electronic Digital Door Peephole Viewer Doorbell with 24 TFT Monitor IR Camera It is made of cheap materials so the data stripe was torn while trying to set it on the door They had promised to send another part but never kept the promise and they are ignoring my emails

Seriously unworthy of ordering any product from Pharmapacks as they are so customer UNFRIENDLY and a disservice to Walmart customers Item was unopened and in perfect conditionPharmapacks refusing to pay for return shippinghow pathetic
No need for companies like this
The host was rude and abrupt with my husband
He called the host to advise check in time
He was told he couldnt check in until after 8pm
When the host returned home
Which is unacceptable considering he called at 4pm
Would not recommend host

I received my bookFinally
It Looks ok
BUT  I received my book in a MONTH
It took Pastbook a M O N T H to send me a book 
Literally  I requested a photo book on 3 of January and received the book on 6th of FEBRUARY 
They sent me excuses on 27th of January stating that they had problems
I asked to return my money back  and then they said that they have already shipped my item and can not return money
Excuse Me They said the book should be ready in 10 business days I wanted this book for my husbends birthday  and it was much too late Now I don t need a book I need my money back but they are not giving them 
Its not a good company
I thought there will be more candies for the price you pay Thats not the case
I ordered 4 pkgs Depends  50 I received only 1 pkg Customer Service said that is the price for 1 pkg NOTE the same product sells for 1899 in local stores I paid more than TRIPLE for 1 pkg of Depends
Car ready  all good
This is the single worst company Ive ever dealt with
I ordered prescription sunglasses and they sent the original lenses aside I noticed that the lenses they sent aside didnt have the RB engraved on the left lens and didnt have the Ray Ban Sticker on it Thats because they are FAKE Although the sunglasses are original
I tried bringing this to their attention I tried communicating with several of their employees and was always told that if youre not happy with it just return it while completely ignoring the fact that they had just sent me fake lenses
Ive never gone out of my way to say anything negative about a company but for this one I felt like I had to let other people know
Their customer service is the worst Ive ever seen and theres a complete lack of respect for their clients
I ordered in November 2016 The Package never arrived at me but was returned from Frankfurt Transit Facility directly back to China without any reason given to me as a receiver This happened in December Until today the end of February 2017 TD argue that they didnt get the package back so they cant return my money And even if so they will pay back only 80 of what I paid So stop waiting now and start the negative booking operation on my credit card
This was my first and last experience with TinyDeal
Dont make the same mistake
I received an sms that flowers are on their way at about 1300 Saturday At 1700 I received a text saying they were delivered and my friends husband said theres no one and nothing 40 minutes later the flowers have arrived Question  how is that sms service working and what was those 40 minutes for
There is no one to address your question to if its outside the working hours So you just sit in another country and wondering whats happening over there
And if the client is ordering in English maybe itd be a great idea to send the sms also in English not Swedish
On the picture that my friend sent me the color of the flowers was completely different pink than it was on the website Not even talking about the bouquet size
I had to change my flight and it was a nightmare I had a hard time understanding he customer service reps I found flights on FlightHub website to change too but each time I called to rebook the fares were not available so I had to keep calling back I never did change flights I had to cancel instead I was angry with the outrageous fees to make the change and the rep didnt ever address my concerns or answer the questions I asked She kept responding Do you want to change your flight instead of answering my question which was What is the benefit of booking through FlightHub vs going right through the airline when the cancelation or change fee is more than double She couldnt answer that
I finally talked to a rep after many phone calls who suggested I just get a refund and start over It was a great idea that nobody else suggested
So Ive never really been into Apple I think theyre overpriced and Ive always thought of them as quite a snobby company However my boyfriend loves them and convinced me to try out their products So for Christmas he bought me an iPhone 6 and I bought him an iPhone 6S the new Apple TV an Apple controller and the new iWatch totalling to approximately 1750 I am one of these people that hate paying for overpriced merchandise but I thought for the price at least they should be decent and last a long time And I wouldve assumed after spending that amount of money that Apple would give a st if there were any problems How wrong of me At Christmas my boyfriend opened his watch and was over the moon but it would barely fit on his wrist We joked about how they must of made them for super skinny wrists However a month later we found out that Apple make watches for women and men although they deny this So I emailed them and said that I wasnt very happy because I had obviously bought the womens watch despite saying to the sales guy that I was buying it for my boyfriend I told them that my boyfriend was thinking about selling the watch and buying the other one which is really heartbreaking for me because it was so much money 400 is a lot of money obviously not to them but to me its a ridiculous amount And theres only about 20 difference in the two watches so obviously I wouldve liked to have gotten him the bigger one for the extra 20 but I wasnt given this option from their illinformed staff So I got an email from them about a week later saying that they dont do men and womens watches just different sizes of the screen and if I wasnt happy my boyfriend should sell the watch and put it towards a new one I was absolutely gobsmacked Firstly do you not think I should have been told that there were different sizes I know nothing about Apple and they should assume that for all their customers I went into their store to ask for their help specifically Otherwise I wouldve just ordered online which I wish I would have because I probably wouldve been given more information Secondly they obviously didnt listen to a word I said because I told them I did not want him to sell the watch It actually makes me feel gutted and to tell a customer to sell their brand new item instead of making THEIR mistake right is disgraceful Actually disgraceful Who in the hell do they think they are I wouldve actually been more agreeable if they had said that there was nothing they could do But to tell me to sell it I still cant get over it now What shoddy customer service Obviously once they sell you their overpriced products they dont want to know any more I dont think Ive ever felt let down more by a company and it just solidifies my views on these sorts of companies Never again will I shop at Apple Shocking customer service if you can call it that
Terrible trimming quality everything stay away
My family stayed at an Airbnb rental that had a KNOWN NATURAL GAS LEAK The six of us are fortunate to have survived AND Airbnb wouldnt even talk to me about the issue If anyone asks us we would highly recommend NOT patronizing this company Your next of kin may regret your decision if you do This experience has been a nightmare Action that resolves an issue to the CUSTOMERS satisfaction is the only path for a company that cares about the safety of their customers
Wish I had never ordered from this company I was impressed with the order process and delivery time but when the product arrived it wasnt fit for purpose despite this they insisted on charging me 25 to return the product I send emails that werent replied to I was offered call backs by customer services that werent kept to And when you did speak to a person they just kept referring to terms and conditions no humanity or at all might as well have been a robot Im now have a case against the company with the ombudsman
I wont ever be dealing with them again and would advise anyone the same
I never got the book and I was charged 5400 on paypal on
January 13 2017 Reference  843WR81S
Placed order for Moses basket and stand online and used discount code which was accepted at checkout and order confirmed Expected next day delivery and item never arrived Upon phoning customer services they advised that the order was in dispute due to an incorrect discount code being applied This was the first time that they had notified me of this yet had confirmed the purchase via email and proceeded to debit the funds from my account Their error somehow was implied to be my fault and they would only release for dispatch should I pay the difference After getting nowhere with customer services i asked to speak to a manager to which they refused Poor standards of customer service which no acknowledgement of their error Id advise against using this company
DONT EVER ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY CHECK THE BBB 1306 COMPLAINTS FILED AGAINST THEM I placed an order on 29 with them without any research thought I was ordering from a local floriston 210 they called me sent me an URGENT text and an email to contact them about my order After trying to deal with someone who could not communicate clearly and had no clue what she was doing i cancelled my order They kept trying to offer me a discount but I told them at least 4 times to just cancel Once they confirmed verbally that they cancelled and told me Id get a confirmation in an email from their supervisor I placed another order with a competitorAvas apparently never cancelled the order but delivered it and now refuses to refund me because the flowers were delivered and they showed no cancellation on my order I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT NO ONE DO BUSINESS WITH THEM MY COMPLAINT WITH THE BBB WILL BE 1307
Poor quality too expensive for what i got Did not look like what picture advertised
Never got message that boots had arrived in shop apparently they were there since Friday 10th Feb and I rang shop on Monday the 13th Feb to be told they had arrived told the girl that I did not relieve any notification apparently I wasnt the only one
Bogus key site will send you nothing Reporting to paypal as scam When I opened a case with PayPal they asked me to close it Why would you do that if youre legit They did however refund my money
I got a couch from here for a great deal but when they delivered the couch to me I noticed a big discoloration where the sale sign was
Had the truck for 2 weeks and it had never worked Once it is taken out of the package you cannot return it but it comes with a warranty So far Ive been going back and forth trying to figure out why the truck isnt working For 250 the truck should work I also believe if it doesnt work within the first week then you should be able to return it
Just like Ezpopsy and it may be the same company these guys are scammers How many things can get lost in the post Im sorry but in this world of technology things do not get lost this often nor are they this far from what has been represented DO NOT BOTHER and if you do pay through PayPal then you may have some chance of getting your money back after they have ripped off
This is a scam
I sent an email over a week ago complaining about the poor condition of the books I recently ordered I have yet to hear from anyone
Disappointed with the inability to get feedback Quaility has been below acceptable
Why do they ask for so much personal information to buy a 55 euro shoe rack They demand date of birth banking details details of mortgage or rental payments etc Outrageous What sort of scam is it
no replies at all from customer service Because of this I lost the reimbursement of the flight ticket from a third party Thanks a lot
I have been an affiliate with Fishpond for just over 6 months Have been sending them a whole heap traffic and sales Earnt commission in the process and to date have been paid zero cents
Despite their interface showing the exact amount I am owed they refuse to pay They just keep giving me bull excuses such as you havent met the minimum payment threshold which is a lie as I had to show them a screenshot of their own interface proving otherwise Once they seen this it then turned to our IT team are looking at it then our finance team are looking into it to we are currently investigating etc etc etc
After repeatedly asking to stop lying and transfer the payment into my account I get
 please allow 3 business days for someone to contact you on the issue
then
 please allow 12 business days
then
 please allow another 3 business days for finance to get back to you
etc etc
It never ends and they are just taking me for a ride
You know you arent been taken seriously when your replies come in the middle of the night all from a different user agent clearly outsourcing customer service overseas
I have gotten replies from Irene Tania Taryn Juanita Sarah Lorraine  Emily Sometimes the same person rejoins the email thread that has been going on for over a month
Im sick of emailing and getting taken for a ride so now looking to take legal action
Anyway Catherine I know you are going to ask for this so here is my reference number 2ZZ45M7
Seems you are quite busy and used to replying to complaints I actually did say many times in the email chain I would refrain from writing a bad review here but they just kept saying sorry for the inconvenience please wait x amount of business days and someone will get back to you
I wish I read this thread earlier
A message to others out there be warned Stay away they are dodgy And you will NOT get paid by them
I BOUGHT THE CATS CRADLE BOOK FOR MY 7 YEAR OLD AND 11 YEAR OLD SON BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL EXCITED AFTER I SHOWED THEM HOW TO PLAY WITH YARN  I ENDED UP GETTING THE BOOK BUT NO STRINGREALLY WHAT GOOD DOES THAT DO
Hello
I bought an activation code on this site but I have been waiting for now 2 days without news of my activation code
Being impatient to be able to play for Honnor as soon as this exit I took care to buy my code in advance but to no avail 
Very disappointed and for pity answer me and send me my code 
A disappointed customer Order 195100479654
I normally do not post reviews but I just couldnt help myself I purchased flowers and extras totalling 180 EURO to send to a friend overseas for their birthday and I was completely disappointed The bouquet delivered was nothing at all what was advertised on their website  complete false advertising at its best I had requested a bouquet of fireball roses which was supposed to be an amazing bouquet with roses in orange red and yellow colours What was delivered was some strange looking arrangement with 4 roses carnations and other green leaves which resembled nothing like the original picture I mean I understand there could be some slight variation to what was displayed on the website but it was completely wrong and I thought they had delivered the wrong bouquet
After contacting customer service and expressing my disappointment their solution was to call my recipient and see if they wanted to swap the bouquets I mean seriously the recipient has no idea what was originally ordered or its worth so is this appropriate I have never heard of such poor customer service They would only deliver a new bouquet if they could take the other one back which by now had been sitting in my friends house for almost 2 days
They will not refund my purchase or even part of it and so I am left writing this review Please do not waste your money with this company and use an alternative service
After saying car was booked I then got an email 2d later to say no cars like that were available
It would seem that I was drawn into believing that I had got a bargain rate for the car I wanted only to be offered a different smaller car
This is 5 months in advance so I suspect its the companies way of drawing me in to their rentals
Going into American freight was great I really felt welcomed in The following timeline then just dwindled at a downward spiral My furniture took 3 weeks to come in I had to go to another store Then the store did not have all of the paid furniture so I had to revisit the main store I bought from only to be told that my furniture was not in 1 week later I called and they told me that they had no record of me missing anything when I explained I had already spoken to Randy about the situation they said oh okay well your night stand has been here It seems as though the organization of the company is very poor the prices are great deals but the hassle to get the furniture afterwords is stressing I recieved my headboard that was suppose to fit my queen bed and low and behold its too big not all of the bolts were including in the installation as wells overall I feel I would rather pay more somewhere else than come again
I booked a hotel in India during Feb 18th 2017 period and received email from Agoda stating I will have to relocate to whatever crappy hotels they are now suggesting because the hotel I reserved is overbooked and I will not get more than 50 refund This isnt my mistake to begin with They stated within 3 days of booking I am eligible for only 50 Though they informed me very late and I am not entitled for refund Its there mistake to inform me late and so they should pay me in full Very bad experience and would not recommend this site to anyone for booking No customer care available internationally only UK number
I ordered 4 Vietri green cups for 100 and only received 3 Wanted a refund or the 4th cup Havent heard anything
I placed an order on February 11th I used a promo code for free shipping but ended up paying 5 for my order to be shipped in one business day I have called a number of times for a tracking number and keep being told my order is in fulfillment After one of the items in my order was canceled by the company I requested that my full order be canceled I was told the order was in fulfillment and unable to be canceled I was also told that I would received shipping notification later that day I have yet to receive any shipping notification or tracking information At this point I will never order from this company again and couldnt in good conscious recommend them to anyone else
Order  20136702169326970
I ordered priority mail Said it would arrive ion 2 days Didnt arrive until Monday
Is not worth very expensive the voice isnt clear the service is bad
Wouldnt ever use Pack  Send again or recommend them to anyone took a week for my package to even be collected and phone calls to them every day stating that it hadnt been collected
Biggest pain
Bad You saved my card details without permission
I was disappointed that the 57 business day shipping time frame indicated on the web site was exceeded by at least one week
Unique Fitness responded immediately with an apology and a partial refund that restored my faith in them as a source for future purchases
Their website said the airfare Quote d was 549 taxes and fees included but then I was charged 159 for taxes and fees I immediately called to dispute and was told that it was a glitch on my computer and if I logged off and logged back in in an hour I would see the correct price I pointed out the absurdity of this and the suggestion to log off was repeated by the rep I logged off while I was on the phone and logged back in and the price was still 549 with taxes and fees included He told me I was wrong and finally offered to cancel the transaction for a fee I refused to pay the fee and eventually he said he would cancel it free of charge However I still see the charge for the fees and taxes on my credit card I eventually booked through the airline itself for a much cheaper rate including the taxes and fees
Expensive shipping that was 10 more than Quote d and steep customs fees made a 90 purchase add up to 200 I wanted to believe I could make purchases from home and just learned a very expensive lesson as to why 97 of online retailers do not ship to Bosnia
I have been a geriatric nurse for 30 years People rely on receiving their care items in a timly manner Everytime I place an order for my Mother in law it takes an unreasonable amount of time to receive I sent an email with my concerns but received no reply I thought everyone deserves a second chance but Ive given up farewell to Easy Comforts as my home care needs
You usually find out what a company are really like when something goes wrong with an order This is a great example
My delivery was very late the restaurant wouldnt answer the phone when I called to chase so I tried JustEat live help
If the definition of Live Help is using outsourced generic customer service people reading from a script who can give you no help or any meaningful information other than stock answers like the restaurant must be really busy and take no responsibility for my order despite handling my payment and taking a hefty  of the order valaue from the restaurant then I guess its good service Useless
Ive used you over 100 times and wont bother any more
Avoid
I purchased a log set for my fire place on 12916 and the order arrived on 121516 just in time to set up for a planned Christmas Dinner Im well versed on setting these up and began installing the burner and other items that come along in the package on 121716 I then moved on to opening the logs and immediately found damaged logs which appear to have been damaged by UPS during shipping After evaluating the package I determined it was poorly packed and there were no fragile stickers I immediately tried contacting customer service by phone but they dont work on the weekends I then called back and reached the sales team who provided me with their Customer Service Manager John Mera I left a detailed message for John and asked that he reach me ASAP so we could resolve the issue before my planned family dinner I also followed up with an email to John with the details concerning the damage and also provided photos After talking with John he mentioned that because this appeared to be shipper damage that Star Fire Direct requires him to file a claim This was obviously concerning to me as this meant it would take longer for me to receive good logs I can go on and on with more details but this too is taking up my time I found myself having to stay in contact with John by phone and email to ensure the logs I paid over 600 for where shipped to me Throughout this entire process John assured me he would address the issue but never came through I took time out of my day at work to email call and check status I finally received my logs on Jan 20th In my opinion John should have shipped me new logs after receiving detailed pictures and written communication Procedures are put in place to ensure people are not taking from you but should be put aside when the facts are right in front of you I tried to avoid from writing this review but to this day John and Starfire Direct has not reached out to me to help ease the pain from this terrible experience I will be following up with the manufacture as I have saved all emails and pictures to make them aware of how they conduct business Good Luck
Atraso e m informao
I was told the book was in very good and new condition but when recieved it was very used
Dear representative
I didnt receive enough details about my booking In general there were nice persons but yesterday I have suddenly received the information that I dont have a room in Brussels anymore It was a mistake but is this normal for a serious company I hope that everything else will be fine But you should pay attention to the clients and their expectations
If I buy a package of 500 minutes I don get full time Secondaly you have increased your prices a lot
I sent off my cards almost a week ago and still havent received any comfirmation or check for the money on the cards When I email them about it I dont get any response Im starting to feel that I got ripped off
They did not deliver my flowers and did not say anything about it on the day  so I did not make other arrangements I am extremely disappointed Avoid this scam company
No one turned up
On my arrival in Marseille France the Goldcar agent tried to sell me its own insurance I said that I was already insured but he forced me to pay extra insurance at the desk After several unsuccessfull emails with Goldcar I decided to start a claim on website of Weclaim 
 And I won 
Take a look at this article published in Le Monde
They talk about Weclaim and its big victories in Court against Goldcar 
I have been talking with psychics on this site for years and spent thousands of dollars on them They claim to be REAL yet the majority of the time their predictions do not happen They save themselves by putting a Disclaimer at the bottom of their page saying that they are for entertainment purposes only ie completely discrediting themselves at the same time as saying that they are the REAL DEAL
When I try to get refunds from Kasamba for some of the money I have wasted on fakes they ignore my requests not even send an email Kasamba needs to step up and take responsibility for the scammers on their site because many hard workers are losing money by contacting these fake readers who give people false hope I would say only one or two psychics on this site seem genuine and some predictions have happened but for the most part even the ones who seem the most real are fake and just tell you what you want to hear I also find it hard to believe that many of these psychics get 5 from customer reviews as I have rated some readers with a 1 or 2 and it does not show up in the ratings for others to see the readings were more than 5 minutes in length Kasamba messes around with the rating system as well so some readers look like they are rated higher than they actually are so beware
I could go on all day about this unprofessional service Booked a holiday of a lifetime or so we thought
 after booking a year in advance turned up to be told that there was no room booked in accident the year before and what was supposed to be a romantic holiday was spent in a small room with single beds after hours of negotiation to try and get us a room
 Had to go back every morning and several times throughout the day to get them to change the room wasting hours of our holiday
 booking agent has taken no responsibility for the mistakes and left us to sort it
 booked us on a wine tour on a bank holiday leaving us 2 hours of a 5 hour tour because everything was closing
 agent was rude and arrogant in response
 no resolution after 5 weeks of the issues You are supposed to book with agents for peace of mind and professionalism You would be better booking it yourself because at least you can make the mistakes Shocking and will never use them again Understand mistakes can happen but its the way they manage the resolution which has angered me the most
BOOKING AGENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO GET THE DETAIL RIGHT THAT IS THEIR PROFESSION FOR ANYONE READING THIS PLEASE LOOK AT THE REPLY THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY RESOLVE ISSUES AND THEIR GENERAL TONE OF VOICE IS CONDESCENDING A TRUE INSIGHT INTO HOW WE HAVE BEEN TREATED
Customer service was very responsive but it has been 2 weeks since i placed an order and still have not received my shipment
Placed an order and two day shipping as it was a gift After order placed received no further information Was not informed item was back ordered  Spent two days trying to call before call was answered  Do not use this business
WE DID NOT SEE OR COLLECT OUT CARS AND HAD NO REFUND EVEN THOUGH WE PAID THE RENTAL
DO NOT RENT CAR FROM GOLDCAR via RENTALCARS or ANY PLACE
THIS IS SCAM TO GET MORE MONEY
Process
RentalCars accepted visaDANcard for rental of car website
But later in process with Goldcar at pick up GoldCar suddenly did not accept deposit for pick up and we had to rent new cars 2 families from other car rental company We could not collect the cars
GoldCar did not in any way help at 1130 pm at night with small kidsThey could at least call the other rental companies for vacant car We 2 families with kids had to rent new cars with discussion for and 25 hours delayed NO refund even though we could not collect the cars
THIS IS A SCAM TO GET MORE MONEY
This is frustration as
1 All previous car rental companies accepts this card me and other
family never had rental or buying issues
2 All other rental companies in Milano airport accepts
this visaDANcard
3 First AFTER CAR RENTAL IS PAID Goldcar makes notes of
not accepting this DANcard Of course you do not read this small in
gray as you already paid once with this car for rental creditcard
accepted
This is not fair when Rental Cars first accept and then later in procces
dont This is to confusing for a customer and not a clear buying process
4 With so many previously confused customers information
from GoldCar and Bank RentalCars should not accept
visadancard in the process of rental with Goldcar
5 RentalCars should not cooperate with GoldCar Just look at all
the bad GoldCar Reviews
NEVER RENT A CAR FROM GOLDCAR
ITs a scam car rental company with no customer service
Just look at all the bad reviews I was stupid enough not to arg
There where 2 surprises when we tried to book via your website
1 We were linked to bookingcom and they did the rest of the process Is that what your organisation has arranged with them
2 We booked a twinroom for 2 persons but it appeared according to the owner a single room Efforts to change this was not possible only could we change the names The room was the same but not the price So we have to pay  50 extra Will you compensate us for this 
As you see below my first name comes twice which means there are 2 persons booked I have changed the names in that of me and my husband Gerardus
The shipping was super fast as usual The Polka Ecig worked for about 20 minutes after charging and has not worked since This is the first time I have ever had this issue with TW I am not happy with the product but will still buy from TW It was a discounted product I would not recommend buying this
Had to check out after one day and HotelsOne did not make it easy to initiate refund Had to spend hours in the phone and sending emails Very frustrating Will never use HotelsOne again
The delivery was late and I could not contact anyone to see what was happening When it finally arrived a month late the drawers were broken Very unhappy
Ive been asked to rate their service before receiving their product Its been 18 days since purchase and still no package Emailed them twice and still no package
It would take a while to write all the bad things I experienced with this company They have owed me a new dinning room table now for over a month cuz the one that was delivered was all scratched up
After several promises that Ill get a new one they stopped calling me so Im assuming Ill never get it
Also it took 2 weeks to have the bed I ordered come in when the day I bought it they told me it would only take two days They never called me to explain anything it was me calling every other day asking where my stuff is
I hate this place
Placed an order on 6th Feb today is 14th Feb still at stock confirmed status
I have used Euro florist in the past and had good experiences Unfortunately on this occasion the flowers have started to die after one day and the flowers were not as impressive as the picture shown online
The thing I wanted I paid for but they apparently didnt have it in stock So now I dont have what I wanted as a gift
almost one year now i am still waiting for my refund I have shipped all the items back to Room 201 2nd floor building 8 zhongxin industrial city chuangye road shenzhen guangdong province 518054 china I spend 100 us dolloars for shipping I should get all my money refund as your company promises me This is my teenager son hard working money your company should not scam young kid
hi
Jesus even the ESB have a better website that allows a customer to enter meter readings 247 365 days a year
It also shows consumption per billing over a year and cost over the same period
Thats from a semi state company as well So whats Energias excuse

This Driver Support took my money and I got nothing and can not contact anyone to get help I emailed 3 times and heard nothing If they will post this my advise is stay away from this Driver Support
Overpriced very little customer care
DO NOT ORDER STAY CLEAR OF THIS CPMAPNY  ITS CHEAP PRODUCTS
I ordered a dozen mugs with pictures to be added to them When the mugs arrived half of them were damaged in shipment  production issues folded picture edges and scratches
They replaced them with another order that showed up damaged
The 3rd time around and as well a new dozen order they again showed up with the same issues They sent a 4th replacement order  the same thing happened Cmon out of all 39 that were sent replacements and all there were only 21 useable mugs
UNBELIEVABLE So all in all after spending almost 60000 on this product I have 21 useable mugs and a 9600 refund and as well a garbage full of damaged and production issue mugs
NOT GOOD IF ONE WANTS TO STAY IN BUSINESS
PLEASE STAY CLEAR OF THIS COMPANY
I ordered the contacts almost a month ago and they havent came yet This is unacceptable because they charged my card and i didnt receive anything Im mad
My first purchase will be my last The quality of the products I received were comparable to what I find at your average one dollar store For the quality of what I received the prices are ridiculous I most definatly did not get the quality I paid for
Very disappointed
Was a waste of time Not well designed
I bought a frame not knowing how Id look in it The frame was nice but didnt do anything for me so I returned it I knee there was a restocking fee for returns when I ordered However the amount is extremely high Ill never order again from COOL FRAMES because of this fee

Ive emailed several times trying to get a response on when units will ship The website stated 710 days and we ordered mid December It is now January 24th and we are still waiting for our order Every time the same response is that weve had troubles since merging with Trascat
Has to be a classic of example of how NOT to do business Would never ever use this company again The uncaring attitude when one lodges a complaint just makes it worse
After much promotion decided to buy from tackledirect a christmas gift Purchased for the first time a 13 Fishing Green Omen fishing rod Received a rod with a bent tip a bow to the left Contacted tackledirect sent the rod back Received the same exact rod back with no explanation Expected them to stand behind their sold products and to the stated warranty so much for the worlds premier fishing otufitter selling me a defective junk and not even exchange a defective rod I have two dozen rods and none of them have a bend at the tip And 13 Fishing products were a dissappointing chistmas gift even for me the gift giver
I ordered the 19th a deliver of 12 roses to the 21thand since then the only info I get was we didnt receive the confirmation yetthis is just disgusting and not acceptableI expend almost 200 euros with this company and now they dont give me any customer service or responde
We should put a demand to this people
Very upseting and not proffesional
pd after more than 48 hours waiting deliver was done but not compensation at all
I ordered a gift box for my sisters 30th birthday I liked the choices and was pleased I could switch out separate products On the website it says same day delivery for Sydney orders So I was quite comfortable selecting the Australia Post option I placed my order on Feb 12th and when asked preferred day for delivery I selected Feb 16th On the 14th I received an email from Australia Post saying my shipment had been delayed and would be sent on the 15th Unfortunately the package never arrived and when my sister followed up on the 17th with A Little Luxury she was told they would follow up and get back to her Unfortunately nobody got back to her and she followed up again on the 20th where the woman she spoke to did not offer any apology and basically told her these things happen When we looked up the tracking we could see the parcel had actually gone all the way to Brisbane My sister finally received her birthday package on the 21st  5 days after my requested day Whilst I understand Little Luxury can not control Australia Post I was so disappointed that there was no follow up and more importantly no apology I have used this site previously and had recommended it to friends but after this experience I will no longer recommend it This was a special birthday and I specifically ordered this basket for my sister to take on her trip away and because of the delay she did not have it SO DISAPPOINTED
I had very bad experience with German Euroflorist Flowers were not delivered at all and they have very bad customer service I am trying to find out what is the compliant procedure but I have refused this information I am very frustrated does anybody knows how to get the money refund 
I have to say that it England would not be acceptable the way customer service spoke to unhappy client
Still having to chase them four months after the completion of my property for unfinished work Additional fees keep being added which they had not accounted for originally Communication from staff very slow and not informative I would never recommend this company
None available as stated by the rep Made trip to unit to find there wasnt any
In short
 Bought my phone there because it was cheaper then at any other place
 Did notice back then already that everybody seemed to have problem with incredibly bad service but i thought Oh i wont need that anyways
 Got the phone 2 month after I ordered it and countless emails to the customer service
 Had 2 minor problems with the phone after 7 month and spend 5 weeks debating with the customer service about how to handle the problem
 Threatend me that they would make me pay 25 of return fee for shipment if i send it back and it was working So I thought ah ok its not that bad
 After 10 month I started having mayor problems with my phone and actually send it back even though they again told me they would make me pay for it
 After 2 12 month and hours with the customerservice I got my cellphone send back to me had to pay the extra charge plus shipment All of that because they dont consider the error on my phone not a major problem for using it Which all local electricstores told me it was
Conclusion
Even if the prices are lower then anywhere else and you think you will never have to deal with the customerservice you should really trust me it is never worth buying there
In there own words
Please note that all our products are imported goods and will not come with manufacturers warranty but instead we will cover the warranty through our own company  amazing  
Unfortunately the leggings I ordered for my 3 year old little girl came apart at the seams the first time I put them on her She cried because she wanted to match her big sister I purchased two matching tops AND leggings I loved the pattern so much such a disappointment 
I ordered online and unfortunately the company used DHL Canada as their shipper DHL does not accept that fact that people work Not everyone has the luxury of staying home to wait for packages I did not get an option that I am happy with I am going out of my way to pick up the packagebut I can tell you this muchI will not purchase from any online shop that uses DHL for their delivery Not ever and I suggest to all others to do the same DHL obviously does not hold all the cards in this consumer gamewe do
If you are in a rush simply dont rely on their rush service They were completely unresponsive with the delivery on time after I contacted them they said that my card was declined I called my bank and the bank stated that the order was deducted from my account Simply unbelievable Not recommend at all and would avoid any other buying with them
Shipito have lost my parcel containing an expensive jacket Ive been trying for 3 days to get some answers Customer service very poor indeed Do not use this company Looks like Ive lost 250 Very disappointed
But it was merely the site
The host canceled immediately without a message as it why
I blame how the site handles communications between client and potential host
I absolutely hate that there is a required membership to shop this brand I know a lot of people who choose not to shop Fabletics simply because they dont want to sign up to be a member and be billed monthly unless they remember to skip the monthly plan That is so ridiculous
Unfortunately I became a member and dont want to cancel my membership just in case I decide I want to order product again because I am a fan of the leggings Fabletics made Im simply stuck with this membership until I can find a comparable product and finally cancel it
The worst part of this whole business plan is that once a customer is stuck with a membership the products they have to choose from are always out of stock
As I write this review I am actually questioning why I choose to remain a member I will be cancelling my membership
I made a booking Jan 29 said to wait two minutes for processing I should add I realized it was a no cancellation policy for this room the page finally went blank I thought it didnt go through so went ahead and did it again It went through this time then I received two emails saying I had two rooms booked Went in and can called the second of course says no refund I spent prob two hours on the phone with four different people First call after being on the line with the lady trying to find the transaction forever the call was dropped second time same thing went through it all call was dropped again third time got fellow named Rog he cant find anything either tells me to call back in an hour must be something with their system Fourth talked with a lady who said I would receive an email with 24 hours Of course no email these people know exactly what they are doing right down to the dropped callsexcuses of not finding the transactionsystem maintenance and then oh yatheyre going to send me an email They had no problem getting the two room charges on my credit card exact same day I have just recently emailed themwill see if I get any response
I have made the mistake of using this lot more than once I will not be using them again
In the past I have always had zero excess through them Hand in keys and walk away The last two occasions I have not as I had a UK excess policy On the first rental there was hardly anybody at the check in desk I was told it was OK to leave the car without it being inspected which I did I then got a bill for body damage which I know was not caused by me In the end the credit card company cancelled Goldcars charge
The second rental I took the car back and this time insisted on a signature I would describe it as chaotic The staff were not sufficiently well organised to understand that some of those waiting like me wanted an inspection and signature Many wanting a signature left I got my inspection and signature after 35 minutes The remote worked but they found the lock itself did not 250 euro bill which I am getting back from my insurer
If you take out your own excess really really check the car before you take it and photograph it and be prepared to be messed about and delayed upon return
I bought one LiPoly charger as genuine but it was a fake On arrival the charger not contained the genuine hologram on the back like the real thing Tomtop advertised the item as genuine and original
The fake charger was cought fire one day and my room was almost burned down I had to repaint the walls and such So dont buy from there cheap fake products
I was unable to skip the month Had gone to the customer service help page and followed the instructions to no avail
I did not receive the product I ordered from eVitamins Unfortunately the eVitamins customer service representative was unable andor unwilling to understand the reality of postal delivery in our Mountain area spoke to her twice in the past week of so I also believe that I am due a refund on my order  shipping 2114 as it has not and will not ever be delivered
ATTENTION IL VOUS FACTURE DEUX FOIS
Very poor customer service and website not easy to use
Ordered a pair of shoes when they arrived they were a little too big so I exchanged them Never recieved the replacement pair  So now Im out the  I spent with no shoes  Never again
To begin with we were not sure if we got the low rate that we hoped Password to access bills is to cryptic No obvious saving when compared to previous supplier
It is a scam My aunt passed away I could not attend and sent flowers I provided my cousins phone number and address They claim that both are wrong and there is no such number and address I am talking to my cousin every day on a phonehow come I can reach her out and they cant A person name Ali gives me a lip service in his emails and the company refuses to reimburse me A funeral was 8 days ago but flowers have never been delivered My emails directly to the customer are ignored DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY
Flowers not delivered recipient not called email complain not answered and money not refunded I wait another day and then I contact the authorities Im not going to let my money stolen
Bills a lot more expensive than expected
The monster trucks I purchased did not come with all parts for the chargers Now I have to go out and look for the additional parts which are difficult to find in my local area I think RC Planet should have included the additional charger parts with the monster trucks so the customers would not have to deal with trying to get the additional parts later Very disappointing experience for my kids who have not been able to play with the monster trucks since we received them
Staff have no clue about cancelation policies
The filter leaked where it attached at the pipe coming out of the wall installed and reinstalled as directed wouldnt stop leaking Finally took it out and threw it in the trash Then found out I was on the auto ship replacement filter at 5400 a pop called to cancel but told too late to stop shipment Cancelled auto ship and will have to wait and see if they actually did Filter arrived too much of a hassle to ship it back found a woman with a unit and gave it to her even tho she said she didnt need it Dont waste your money
I have waited 3 weeks and still waiting My prescription was nothing special
They do not do what you ask for They take a LOT of time to check in consolidate and send the package Previously the service was very fast but the quality dropped considerably Chat is good but the service isnt Look for other ways to send your boxes
will not find a 64 BIT driver for canon MF3200 printer
I had to phone twice today and I must say that the first agent was totally INEPT She kept repeating questions that I had already answered was not listening and was totally useless I ended up hanging up because she was wasting my valuable time then I booked on line When I was finishing booking on the site it said that that the 1140 US price would be 148515 in canadian funds Two seconds later when I receive my receipt it is showing that I was charged 152210 So I had to phone back but of course the agent didnt want to do anything for me I threatened to cancell my flight and then he said he would send a message to the billing department I tell you  my experience today with FHub was awful and I will not be using them any more if I can avoid it
I will never order from them again and wouldnt recommend them to anyone Their product tastes terrible and they wont let you send it back for an exchange
No volvere a comprar
After spending getting terrible food would not correct order Said their chefs dont make mistakes I no longer spend my money here
It took 80 days from order to delivery Customer Support Email after 3 Days telling me to wait a bit longer Packaging poor Quality a small white plastic bag Packaging of goods in Bag are damaged I will never buy at newfrogcom again
When you are looking for low prices good service and quick delivery please keep on searching
From my experience you will find nothing of the above at newfrog
Didnt deliver on valentines day
You never followed through with the confirmation from Hertz as promised I chased through the Hertz website and found that I did in fact have a reservation You should follow through if you want returning customers
I joinedI ordered I payed full amount no 15 off
I have taken a membership and I dont find any property in my preferred location I am unable to find a property I am unable to contact the respective owners of the property as their numbers are unavailable or set to automatic message recording settings
No one responding to the numbers
Complete waste of time and effort in contacting them
Very disappointed by taking the membership
My order was not delivered in the 2 days promised by you and paid for by me My mother did not get her Christmas present on time Poor customer service
Couldnt even get the dress I wanted because although I ordered it and it was in stock they didnt have it
They took the money out of my account but never got the security check or the code for my 3 month Xbox live gold trial The customer service doesnt work and the lady that reviewed before left her order number and she got the same generic response saying she didnt leave her order number Order  195100479038
I NeVER signed up for this and cant seem to get off your mailing list I dont even know what the heck you are and dont travel    UNSUBSCRIBE ME
Unfortunately we couldnt stay at this homestay accommodation We arrived at around 730pm at night the place was not as described we did not have the bedroom we were expecting and the place was cold and uninviting It was small yet we were expecting a different house a large 4 bedroom place It was a small 3 bdm home We were surprised to see that we were expected to share a communal bathroom with toilet in it no towel or soap provided in bathroom with a family and their overseas family staying Only one living space Their family members were staying in the room we were originally expecting to stay in The bedroom allocated was small cold and obviously a childs bedroom No where to sit and no radio or tv We were greeted with a list of things and were told not to be noisy The day was miserable but we were not invited to light the fire We left within 3 minutes of arriving and text the host to inform her that the place was not suitable and started the long drive back home The host to her credit offered a 1 night refund as we had paid for 2 nights We only however received a part of this as she also deducted commission and kept the whole second nights stay A disappointing experience I can only suggest you provide accurate information when listing a property so people are not disappointed and bathroom facilities are really important to know about
They refused to fill my order even after providing a copy of my RX and the phone  of my doctor They also called me Umberto in my email even though my name is something totally different Sounds like they mixed up the orders somehow I cancelled the order before it turned into a real nightmare AALens or saveonlens will always be my first now
I placed an order at Coolframescom because of best price conditions
However the manufacturing and shipping took 22 days till I got my delivery which was much more than expected I had to use my old correction glasses all the time which gave me headaches for almost a month
The worst of all is the additional tax costs for delivery into the EU
In my case unplanned 2352 which made the whole decision to buy at a competitive price appear silly
So I bought for 14913
If I placed the order  Coolframesuk I would only have to pay 11087 no shipping no tax which means 25 discount and in only maybe 5 days
So never will I ever place an order again in the US
Imo it would have been quite easy for the online shop to advise me to shop on the UK homepage Im hardly dissappointed from this experience
I have emailed MobileFun 3x trying to cancel an item that has been backordered for 2 months And NO RESPONSE I will try one more time If they dont respond I will spend the next 2 weeks slamming them on Social Media

I ordered a hat that never came order number DLN8801OF I need to exchange a jumper that should be for a child I am 51and 112lbs the small wont fit at all I need a large apparently or my money back order DLN29FP03 pink off the shoulder jumper there is no customer service number to speak to a human How do i get in contact with this company Item is still in the original package and im at a loss with what to do I feel tricked robbed Very unhappy customer You take a chance ordering from this company  Order may come it may not Items may fit they probably wont Americans are not 90lbs Thats the weight I would have to be to fit into this jumper There is no return exchange section on their site If you Google it all it does is bring you to the site Horrible company if they can even call themselves a company More like a scam
 at firstthe shop canceled my order without cause
 after that I ordered a second time and the shop send me a shipping confirmation but one week later I get my money back without the ordered product
 there was no compensation
My order from 1st of Dec still hadnt arrived come the 21st of Jan I was told I had to wait until the 5th of Feb before they would even do anything 65 days Not had a refund yet either
The reply shows that the person doesnt know their own website There are 2 separate documents for international It is not a single page PDF

I wanted to send a document internationally instead of parcel as PM was cheaper than USPS by 5 with door to door service also Chat person said documents can also be sent
1 But UI sucks there is no option to choose document So how to enter dimensions or document
2 If you enter a value  0 then you need customs form and you will have delays The UI does not tell you this
3 The printouts are 2 separate PDF instead of 2 pages of a single PDF So I didnt know I was supposed to print  attach 2nd one which is very hidden
4 PM does not print out package requirements before courier person picks up For eg why doesnt courier person detect customs form was missing So my shipment was delayed by 10 days sitting in customs
I shopped for 116 wood dowel pins I did not see anything on the website to suggest that the advertised 116 dowels were in fact 80 Maybe I missed some fine print But when I order 116 I expect to get 116 not 08
One of the worst customer service I ever dealt with Contacted them 3 times to have my item delivered and they promised me it would and I would get a tracking number 3 times and nothing havent even processed my refund yet either I would never buy from here or recommend anyone to
Poor response from support none
Preordered a game second time and they promise delivery on release day But again no delivery Wrote support for two days but no response Opend case with PayPal and got money refunded
Dont preorder games here if you expect delivery on release day
My experience is the same as another reviewer  funds transferred on 7th Feb and 2 weeks later no replies and no contact to advise when bitcoin will be delivered or my funds returned If they are a legitimate company they are the most unprofessional i have ever had to deal with Scam
I brought a steam premium code sold for about AU390 and got a game worth not more then 60 cents on steam When asked about the refund policy if the game was worth less then the price i paid i was told that I would not get my money back because that is not the regular price Will not purchase from here again because of this scam
Been a customer of Paddy Power for about 8 months I reckon Im not really a gambler and just try my luck now and again  usually if theres a free bet or promotion involved to help make any losses acceptable Having said that Ive lost far more than Ive ever won with them
This morning receive an email saying I could no longer participate in any promotions at all Eh
Whats the point of having promos if you are then going to prevent somebody from actually taking part in them makes no sense to me so Not recommend at all
We did a complete remoldel of our home new sinks tubs everything We put in Peligan salt less water softener and we have hard water deposits and stains on all our new sinkstubs glass  Not so happy We also installed a RO It seems to work as promised
I think the products are great I love to work out and hang out in my Fabletics My challenge is that when I try to use my VIP points the site is ALWAYS out of stock on the items I want It is very frustrating but I order substitute items anyway
Lets start with I never got the watch my wife ordered The reason is because there was no signature asked for on a 350 watch It was just left at the door to my apartment on a Sunday It took a month to get my money back from these people Their call center our what ever they have is atrocious No customer service at all Absolutely rude people until you reach a manager I will never do business with these people ever again And by the way I wasnt going to put this out there but after the hordes of emails I got telling me they were happy it was satisfied I figured I would let them know how dissatisfied I really am
I booked a weekend stay in London I needed to cancel this and was told that I would be able to cancel However after multiple emails calls to operator being told that their systems were down and not working then further emails and no reply or contact at all I would not recommend this company at all
I had a reply to my review that the case had been resolved but no one has answered my email I said that I tried to cancel my booking and asked for confirmation that in fact that it had been cancelled but no reply even after this review they still have not confirmed that my reservation was cancelled Please can you reply to my emails and read what I has asked 
booked two flights separately from Tokyo to Hawaii
1 got confirmed 1 cancelled but we hadnt received the notification email
so we had to book another flight on the day of the departure
I have to say this was the worst shopping experience I have ever had in my entire life I got 2 jerseys paid 52 in a good faith but was informed they were out of stock
Imagine my shock and surprise when I was told that they can not guarantee that I would receive my refund How convenient and easy he can take the payments but suddenly it is nearly impossible to return customers money mind you he is based in one of the biggest global financial centre Hong Kong
Even after explaining there was nothing else I wanted for the next 2 months I was continuously asked to choose something else I do not think he understand the simple basic of running business and clearly he should not be allowed to continue his dishonest operation His own reputation was worth 52 to him
So guys get your jersey somewhere else and do not go through this experience It is not pleasant
I do not recommend playing games from this company Support has always been poor but the last month with Magerealm it had been non existent They just stopped the game events without notice and those that have to have them for advancing are not able to get items we need

Since the confirmation that theyd taken my money the only communication from Euroflorist has been this request to give them a rating They didnt deliver the flowers They didnt explain why they didnt deliver They didnt acknowledge or respond to the emails I sent to them about this
I choose the shorts cause they are red i recived shorts pink for 99 euros unaccepttable
I placed my second order with you guys as I was very happy with my first
But my second purchase there were certain items that werent in stock which I wasnt notified until after the order had been shipped which I did receive a voice mail from you guys at 1030am on the 9th of February which I was working so I am unable to get to the phone during work hours
Idit or Annette was rude on the phone and stated she also sent me an email regarding the products being out of stock but I never recieved an email I just received the PayPal refund transaction once I checked my emails which I then sent an email to the sales department as it wrote on the email with the tax invoice attached to contact them as it was out of business hours because I tried to calling
So I sent this email asking what items were out of stock as I wasnt notified of them being out of stock and if I had know I wouldve made up for them with other colours where as now Im going to have to pay two shipping costs which Sia recieved and was really approachable and willing to help out
In the message Annette or adit left she just said please call us in regards to your order but then procedded to send the order without making contact with me first Poor communication
You should be focusing on the quaility of the service your providing not worrying about sending the items as soon as possible because you dont want to hold the order up
I wouldve got other colours to make up for those items being out of stock so I didnt leave myself short and I was still able to provide a service to my clients
Instead of being understanding on the phone when I made contact this morning she was rude and continued to state all this information that wasnt needed as I understood you dont do back orders but if I had been made contact with I wouldve organised something else
Not good enough when your a supplier and you cant supply or make actual contact with the customer to see if you can make other arrangements to provide them with all that you can
Truly disappointed as I was going to use you as my main supplier but poor service and communication
Item sent had a broken screen bubble pack was already open Refused to replace
Terrible service  Terrible Company
Order samples which did not arrive
Ordered blinds and was told they were out of stock for the material chosen
Offered to change blind material emailed to change material and had no response Called to change material and was told half the order had been started so I could only change the larger of the blinds A completely pointless and unhelpful offer
Sent an email to say they have reprocessed my sample order which is obviously no longer needed
Terrible service Terrible communication Could not be more unhelpful
The dress shipped really fast but the material of the dress was very cheap looking and didnt look like it did in the pictures Would not recommend ordering this dress
I emailed several times and never got any kind of response but i did recieve my money
 ENVIEI VRIOS EMAILS S QUE DIZEM QUE TENHO QUE REFAZER OS PEDIDOS S QUE QUANDO ENTRO NA PGINA GERA BOLETO PARA PAGAR NOVAMENTE EU NO VOU PAGAR
package still sitting at their facility after a week They said on tracking be delivered Feb 23 2017 When I say facility I mean Toronto and I live In Dartmouth Totally unacceptable delivery service 0 stars if I could
Same day dispatch I dont think so
Next day delivery Definitely not
Great Customer Service If you call holding for 35 minutes and still not being answered acceptable
Still havent received item and no way to contact them Shocking service Will not be using again 
I booked a flight and hotel package through lastminutecom and included transfers to our New York hotel The previous travel service was very good and I was very impressed at the service and speed Thats where this stopped Our flight was delayed by 5 hours not their fault and the instructions for the transfers were not accurate After wasting 45 minutes at the airport trying to sort our prepaid transfers we were told it hadnt been booked We gave up and got the bus in to the city thinking as we booked it as a package it wont be a problem getting the money back for a service they didnt provide It clearly said on the paperwork we are to call to book the return transfer as no booking made So didnt bother
Got back and contacted lastminutecom for a refund  the service if you can call it that was horrific It took 8 emails at least me contacting the transfer supplier directly and to threaten legal advice to get the refund
I am absolutely appalled at the service If its a flight only or hotel you may be ok but I certainly wont be booking any of their services again
I mistakenly ordered the wrong shampoo However they were so much alike that I did not realize it untill the order was received I wanted to order the Fekkai Full BLOWN Volume ecause I have very fine hair but instead made a mistake and ordered the Fekka Full Volume Shampoo I thought it was strange that it was cheaper but didnt realize they were not the same products Can I return the three bottles I received and replace them with the Fekka Full BLOWN Volume Shampoo and pay the difference
I bought several products for XMas gifts  3 of those do not work  I have tried to contact Tomtop but never got a response then on Facebook I left a bad review I got a private message a couple of days later with 3 words
Whats your problem
I replied stating that I have 3 items one is a drone so not cheap and they do not work I stated that all my previous emails have been ignored and that I want it resolving by exchange or refund  I have never received a reply although the message was read a day later
AVOID THIS STORE AT ALL COSTS
They sell crap and have no warranty system
I sent you an email several days ago in regard to the condition of the items I ordered The summary of the Email 6 boxes of band aids shipped in a plastic bag The boxes were mashed so much they were scatteredmixed in the bag Not a very smart way to ship these items  I have not received a reply back Dont think I will order from you again if this is the way you treat your customers
Worst experience ever The support number on the website doesnt exist and no one is picking up the one provided via email support stuff Overpriced and hidden costs
Update 1  The flowers that were promised to be delivered on Valentines day havent been delivered even two days later
The company offers online products and not have them in stock I paid and now have to wait for my money No information for now
Was very poor entertainment was not great food never changed was the same things over n over was more for the older people but had a lot of complaints from some of them as well 
Highly recommend good communication and speedy delivery My dress was stunning on and true to size A
Hello
I attempted to purchase an item from fishpond After 5 days the item had not been sent so I decided to cancel the purchase
Fishpond charged me a 5 restocking fee despite never having shipped the item They also charged my credit card for the item despite saying I would only be charged once the item was shipped They sent an email advising I was refunded but this has not been processed on my credit card
They are a drop shipper with a 1030 day turnaround time They then charge a restocking fee if consumers decide 1030 days is too much Refunds are impossible to get and items are rarely received as they literally hold nothing in stock
Many 1 star reviews Unsure if the higher reviews are genuine as many people with similar issues
Extremely dodgy Please dont waste time or money
Spent 64 on flowers for delivery from UK to NZ for delivery on 14 Dec for mothers Xmas Have only spoken to her now Feb to find out if she liked her flowers  she never received them On contacting FloraQueen their response was they wont accept any responsibility because their policy is I would have had to report nondelivery no more than 2 days after delivery date These were an Xmas surprise so I wasnt going to ask my mother before Xmas if she received them I assumed she had  as she has every year when Ive ordered through a reputable international florist Once bitten  never again
The pictures were much different then the actual dresses and it does t really help that my event is super close and that the dresses that came look nothing like the pictures that I saw on the website they need to show the design thats on the dress
Online discount poorly communicated i wasnt told that I had to sign up online when I changed over to energia through bonkers website in order to qualify for this discount My understanding was that was all done on the bonkers website
Word of caution that many sellers who are located internationally especially in India are stating that they are shipping and located within the US Books are being listed as BRANE NEW but arriving in USED condition
To be clear
This is not a lawful transfer of ownership of the software
If you lack ethics andor technical skill to pirate then this might be the way to go for you
You will get a Serial Number that will be in no way unique to you
It will not be supportable via Adobe
The actual content of the course and tests is fine but when you get to the point of taking the real FL State exam it wants you to enter you social security number ON AN UNPROTECTED INSECURE web page When asked about this the response was well its only the last 5 digits which it doesnt actually state on the page and only is almost everything the first 3 digits are generally a region code which can be somewhat easily determined meaning that a hacker would essentially have every digit but 1 And their response is that they cant secure that page for some odd reason
Since apparently I cant reply to the replyNo where it prompts for social security number is still on your site It hasnt passed the data onto the FL DMV yet at that point I looked at the HTML on that page and it is still on your servers
I never got an email confirming my rental of car for Las Vegas in March I had to call Payless the actual rental car agency to get a confirmation Very disappointed
I had a bad experience buying a rod All I heard were excuses for not having
the right size shipping tube in stock Lack of communication on their part convinced
me to cancel the order and take my business elsewhere
I ordered 4 items from the website Im not expecting much since its all cheap and the sizes are different and whatnot but Im upset that unfortunately my order is one of those ones that never come This is the last day my package is supposidly going to come on but I dont have much hope There goes 40 bucks I suppose thats what you get for being cheap If you reply dresslink my order number is DLNI3844W 
18 ordered tough country bumper for Honda Pioneer
111  Called KT Performance to determine if they could supply tracking Rep stated he would call Tough Country to gain tracking details and call back with info No return call ever received
113  Called KT Performance again to receive tracking details Rep called Tough Country and he indicated Tough Country was finishing up bumper build and they would ship by Tuesday 117
120  Tierd of the run around I contacted Tough Country directly They indicated the bumper would not be built for another 23 weeks and it would ship then What the hell now the story differs
Bottom line if the merchandise is going to ship from the manufacturer KTPerformance should note that on their website and indicate it could be 48 weeks before you receive the product The shipping details yes I simulated another order failed to say anything regarding the log jam concerning this bumper However KTP was quick to charge my credit card My first and last order with this company I saw some mixed reviews regarding the organization but decided to give them a try Lesson learned
I dont trust them I sent a book back in decent condition and once received they complained saying it didnt meet their standards and I would have to send them 4 to get it returned back to me OR I could just let them recycle it this is scam and Im sure they are hoping most people will just let them keep it and they probably resell it totally illegal In my case I sent via Paypal the 4 return shipping and wont give them the satisfaction Avoid like the plague
almost impossible to contact or see bills
I wanted to write a review based on whats happened to someone found through yelp and I cant they ask me to download the app to register to give all my data just for a review

I ordered some custom made floor mats for my 2012 Nissan XTrail and waited for 1014 days as advised and they duly arrived So I was a bit flabbergasted when the drivers sid not only looked like it had been cut crooked but when fitted there was at least a 50mm gap between the edge of the carpet and the door As I had thrown the old ones out I kept these
Far from impressed
Would I refer others to Motorquip for these NO NO NO
To Quote an old advert Not happy Jan
This is by far the worst calling card ever It hardly works and frequently asks you to use the UK calling cide even though thats already what is being used It will sometimes fail to connect but other calling cards do Then the recipients never know whos calling as toolani shows an Austria or some other random callerid at the other end The voip app is a waste of money  time Not worth it Just stay away
It took almost two weeks to get the boots I ordered In that time they went on sale in my local shop So I bought them in the sale and returned the ones I ordered
So we have a Citron which needed a new tyres as mine had a puncture The car was due its mot the same day However we couldnt find the locking wheel nut We rang the number to be told well sort it  the guy who came turned up 2 hours early which was great He spent about 2 minutes trying to get the locking wheel nuts off He told me he couldnt do it but we still got charged 25 call out fee Not bad for 2 minutes work
We have since taken it to a garage who got all 4 locking nuts off fit a new tyre and replaced the locking nuts all for 60
My business will be going elsewhere in the future
Its 2nd time I got the wrong order
Afraid I purchased a dress and then 3days later got call to say they oversold Very disappointed
I bought laptop and in a few days I got hardware problem with Radeon graphics card and I asked for my money back due to thid problem which could be fatal for the laptop in time Manager said that they need to run reset the laptop again to find the problem and that was the only way hiwever I was strongly asking for refund and only agreed for them to run this test for their sakes And you know what happened and I only found that out later in a few weeks since I am not the big master in all this softwares and hardwares instead of looking for the problem while running this test they deactivated my Radeon graphics card and only left me with Intel card not so powerful performance thats why I was wondering that when I was watching movies the quality was so bad and I was wondering why also on my Radeon graphics card settings they have changed many things like they put some kind of block on that I could only use powersaving on my internet browser while browsing internet so that I cant even change it to high performance setting so that i couls use the full power of my Radion graphics card Basically instead of ffinding the problem they blocked all the possible ways for the potential problem to come from the Radeon card And I was wondering manager was so sure when he was saying that the problem would not come back again and now I fing know why it would not come back Scam Soundstore in Waterford and please people don t be fooled Scam scam scam
I to have had a very negative experience with speed tech ordered light bar was expecting an email confirming ship date with tracking number Three days later I get an email from their fraud dept telling me that because the shipping address is different than the billing address on the credit card I need to down load a form sign and fax back to them in order to order to have my item shipped
1 I did not buy with a credit card I used PayPal
2 The shipping address is my PayPal Confirmed shipping address same one I have used for 10 years through countless eBay amazon orders
This is not rocket science speed tech and if it was you would be left behind Nobody uses fax any more
I spoke to their fraud blond nothing but air in there
I cancelled the order had them refund back to PayPal account on principle
Set them an email telling them What I thought no reply
Bottom line No intelligent life at speedtech lights Look at the responses to the negative reviews Generic responses from a ghost they care so little about customer service they dont even include a persons name in the response
SpeedTech talks the talk but does not walk the walk
Excellent service fast and efficent
Hello
I ordered a part for a friend the online store says 2 pieces in stock we want part quickly pay 17 euros in shipping for a small envelope
After 3 days nothing is shipped webpage says only delayed
And whats worse when I contact them on Chat answer s here is no delay you will receive your order soon
The problem is I think a lot of fake stock parts
Parts that are in stock on webpage but that is not right they do not have them So when I bought it they have to obtain your part first
This obviously takes time After several bad experiences with this company my conclusion is  stay away This firm is bluffing and lying and agreement that you paid for will not be fulfilled
The item was in stock and would be sent within 24 hours and ordered it with DHL Express 12 days for faster delivery I contact them after 3 days because the goods had not even be sent After many twists I find out that they not have the product in stock at all I paid a hell of a lot of money for it wonder if I even get to see that money back again
Anyway I can not recommend anyone to buy from this site who want a fast delivery Their availability stock is not updated either so if you find the same item but in a different shop buy it there instead
It suffice to see other peoples reviews about Blue Tomato to understand
There is never anything in stock at the Omaha location I always have to order something and wait for it to come to the store before I can get what I need
Ordered a product and arrived as expected The product didnt fit so emailed ahead to request a replacement size and also denoted the invoice note as instructed for returnsreplacements
Received a refund not as requested Emails for clarification remain unanswered
This is just a poor company to deal with an internet outfit who do the bare minimum If there is an option of another supplier  go with that
I wouldnt buy from these guys again Id sooner pay more and get more
When i booked it gave me the cost of the car and when i put my card details in there was an extra approx 60 of charges to bring to a total of 8999 i have already insurance for these extras and did not require them It is very mis leading not to let someone know their total bill before they have put their card details in This is poor practice and has meant that i was over charged by 60

Not as one would expect from a charger that does not include any charging times for AA or AAA mAh batteries The RED lights do not even go off or turn GREEN when fully charged A waste of money
You all took care of my Mothers needs a few years ago with no complaints I ordered my Fathers first order and the box came absolutely soaked I was very disappointed The product seems to be ok thought Also the box was not discreet it had the name and size of the product on the box that is not the way it was delivered to my Mother
I hope future orders will be discreet and dry
This is a fradulant web site DO NOT PART WITH YOUR MONEY

I have been waiting on my delivery since last week I have written 4 emails and sent 2 text messages and logged one delivery query for a sum total of NOTHING from Temple and Webster
I have now received 2 chairs from a 7 piece dining setting with no response or explanation Ill never buy from you again
I mailed multiple gift cards on 119 Out of the several companies available I chose this one Now here I am over two weeks later and it appears my order was lost and as there doesnt seem to be a way to track my order Im now out over 150 I will definitely hesitate to use an online company such as this one Even if retail stores and places like Moneytree pay less at least I wont have to worry about not getting paid Seems like there should be some sort of guarantee or policy regarding cases like this I cant imagine Im the first person this has happened to 
I attempted to surprise my wife with some flowers They were supposed to be delivered by 1pmand nothing I called at 3 pm and they stated the delivery guy was minutes away
I call again at 5 PM to inquire on the order I was informed that the driver was nearby and that the order would be delivered any moment At this point I am done I informed them that they told me this just 2 hours earlier and that I wasnt falling for it again I asked to cancel the order and wanted my money back because we werent going to be home for a few days and that now the order was pointless
They kept refusing the cancellation and kept stating the driver was close After being on the phone for nearly 30 minutes flowers still havent shown up they agreed to cancel the order
Around 6 pm the company called me back stating that the florist would need to be paid 5 for their efforts in delivering the flowers I informed them that if anyone was going to pay this that it would be them Less than 5 minutes after that call I received a text and email indicating that the flowers had been delivered
Around 630 pm my wife receives a call from the delivery driver indicating that they were minimum 1 hour away I informed the driver that the company had contacted the florist and let them know that the order had been cancelled The driver was unaware of this but thanked me for letting them know
On 21317 I contacted the florist to discuss the matter with them They told me that Avas Flowers never contacted them and that they would never charge a 5 cancellation fee
This review is being written for 2 purposes First for the consumers who may be enticed by Avas Flowers marketing dont fall for it Secondly for all Florists out there small or large dont do business with this company They will not only give their company a bad name but they will also tarnish your name The florists who received my order was never informed that the order needed to be delivered by 1 PM and that they are never paid any extra money to do so
They sipped a broken item and want me to send it back and pay for shipping

You guys did not deliver my package to the right address I need my refund ASAP or for this package to be redelivered
I emailed you guys to double check if the address was correct being that it is a military address and I never got a response This needs to be fixed
The policy document led me to believe I was covered for a compensation if there was a piste closure while on a snow holiday This in fact in the small print is only redeemable against the cost of travelling to another resort to ski
This insurance proved worthless for us as every ski resort in the area had closed and this was impossible
I have used Multitrip numerous times before but as this was my first time trying to make a claim and realising how misleading the policy is I will not be using them again
order 3x packs of 2200 pc fifa coins website says buy now get code emailed download and play instantly on my account says order 2100002585 is completed This is not the case at all
after registering and purchasing i got email confirming my order which at just after 11pm said to wait to sometime after after 330am before I would get my codes Hardly complete
I would never of bought from you if you had been honest and had this written up on your site or written on the screen very clearly that this was the case Cdkeys and other websites I use dont do this and send you the codes instantly without such a large delay Will probally not use again terrible service
I bought second car and looked for Quote from 25Plus They provided a good Quote and I paid They forwarded the insurance documents and they stipulated I must send copy of my no claim bonus from my existing insurer I provided this only to be informed that I have to cancel my no claim bonus from my existing insurer They should have stipulated that before I paid To me it was deliberate misselling of an insurance policy I have tried to get satisfaction on line but all I get are proforma email responses Very poor and I have been strongly advised that I have a caseagainst them for being missold insurance They demand full disclosure of all information from clients but they fail to copy their own advice Very poor service
They refuse my credit card and dont let clear in my account sumary if my purchase was canceled or not I definilly will not buy here again
The training of the 300 messages that pour into my inbox could be possible Thats fine However there is no way to accurately delete spam or junk maileven the ones with the same subject line
SaneBox sorts the messages I can do that myself with rules
I ran into difficulty trying to uninstall the programIve been working on getting it off of my computer for three days nowIt may live there forever The Sanbox people dont seem to know how to remove it either
Its been a terrible experiencewith Sanebox not offering any assistance at allthey have sent instructions that dont work and virtually no tech support outside of those links
I cant get the program out of my Outlook Dont put this program on your computer unless you want to see it forever
I needed frames right away so I paid extra for 2 day shipping on Monday and received my frames late on Friday because they took 2 days in shop to get my frames ready to be shipped Not Cool
At step one when you push send money it is guaranteeing you the exchange rate given at that moment for 48 hours This is not true It is only holding it for 30 minutes but you wont find out till after you completed everything It is only holding the rate at step 4 This is misleading and can end up costing you a lot of money when you sit on the guaranteed exchange rate waiting for the right moment to exchange your money
Very disappointed in service this year First never received the Internet codes or key codes for the condo when I called them two weeks before leaving they said we never got a signed contract Well they took all the money for rent but never bothered to call me to say they never received the contract Well signed another and sent no problem Get down here and the wifi code does not work call them up and he said he would get back to me He never did I figured it out for myself Lastly my condo is for sale they never disclosed that to me at time of renting I found myself online Last but most important they would call and ask if I wanted to rent this same condo next year I said yes assuming I was put on the calendar but I keep getting the same call asking the same thing So I did more research and found out they no longer have the contract to rent this after I leave this year I would have paid them drove down next year only to find I did not have a place to stay which I have found that a few people did in other condos thru vacation rental pros came down only to find they could not stay in assigned condo I was lucky enough to find out the rental company that took on this condo so God willing it does not get sold I have a contract for next year If at all possible do not use this rental agency However I know that have the most pet friendly units which is why I used them I am working on others to open up to more pet friendly units
They never send the items Beware is scam
Bought a self adjuster for my 2000 toyota celica gt product description stated it was for my car I ordered it and once i recieved it went to swap it out Does not fit at all completly different design I know over time parts get improved to be better then OEM parts but this is way off Its shorter for one and the ends that fit into the grooves of the shoes dont fit The short side is way to wide and the shoe can move significantly around instead of a firm hold and the longer side that the adjuster wheel screws into is a whole different style Doesnt fit around the shoe plate or the plate behind the shoe Very dissatisfied Now i need to hunt for the part all over again since no part stores or dealerships carry it
My items took to long to ship
My items were not in stock did not know that til after i had already paid
for the items so was stuck waiting
Should have stuck to my trusted corporate kit provider here in Texas Blumberg was late failed to email the right paperwork and provided crappy supplies Will never use them again
Order was late and I paid for upgraded freight contacted on chat and was told I needed to contact UPS and it was my fault the the shipment was late Could not answer why all prior orders shipped with no problem Refused to refund the freight charge even after I phoned UPS and they indicated it was the shippers problem with paperwork Person online did not care Told them I was going to refuse the shipment and they types that they would bill my credit card for all costs for the return and restocking
Will never buy from them again spent over 20000 last year for my business and they could not care less So be it will find someone else to spend my budget with this year
Henry You should check the facts and understand the UPS process before replying because what you are stating is incorrect The paperwork from your drop ship partner was not correct IF the paperwork was correct there would be no need for contact and there would have been no delay Also at the end UPS contacted the SHIPPER to resolve this See UPS comment from waybill POWER OF ATTORNEY PAPERWORK IS MISSING AND IS REQUIRED FOR CLEARANCE Reading a bunch of reviews and appear BH has an inability to admit when they make a mistake Guess customer is always WORNG with your company

I ordered a brand new Xduoo X3 that I paid 7999 Ive never received anything from Tomtop Its been a month since I sent my first complaint and Ive been sending several emails since then but no answer whatsoever from Tomtop Ziltch
Its unbelievable
DO NOT ORDER ON THIS WEBSITE
I had to cancel a part of my trip to Cuba and therefore the hotels I booked via galahotel I informed them one month in advance and received a reply that the reimbursment would take place within 21 days I received this email early December coming back from my trip at the beginning of January I checked my account and no refund was executed I have sent several reminders in which I politely asked for information on the refund and its status I received a standard answer that the payment had not yet been executed without providing a date for the refund or any further explanations for the delay
The reimbursment conditions stated on the website and in their reply were not respected free cancellation with refund in 21 working days It is now more than one month after the deadline of reimbursement and still counting I start to think that late refunding is a strategy that this company use to yield interest That is probably why they keep on this delaying my reimbursment of an important amount
I hope that at some point I will get the refund but I am honestly start to doubt it To avoid finding yourself in the same extremely unpleasant and unprofessional situation I would strongly advise to avoid dealing with GalaHotels Do not hesitate to share this information
Dispite the fact that the company replied to my comment here below no one contacted me the refund did not take place nothing has happened in these 3 days Galahotels I am just asking to have back my money This is absurd that it takes so much time that you continue providing standard answers no update on the refund and no concrete action

I went on a shopping spree spending a few hundred and then some on DHGate only to receive counterfeit items When i brought this up to customer service for each individual order they told me that the products were not counterfeit and they couldnt see the comparison between what I received and what was described The fonts of the labels are different the packaging is off and the products themselves were faulty and not quite right Everything is unsellable for my business DHGate refuses to right the wrongs and keeps siding with the manufacturers on certain products Ive lost a lot of money and precious time dealing with this company If something seems too good to be true guess what it usually is and thats what youll get with DHGate
they charge people for no reason too much money And do not respond or not to the questions i asked for totally unprofessional
NEVER EVER
Delivery was very late at around 1940 which I did not expect or have any warning of when buying Flowers were adequate but were dissapointing for the amount paid
Be warned and record conversations I booked a compact automatic car for a month but was disappointed to receive a semi automatic cumbersome Fiat 500  dreadful car to drive they said no other car was available at the time so I had to take it After the drive to our destination I found the car to be difficult and in my eyes dangerous to drive as in a parked position it would roll forward downhill in REVERSE gear before enough acceleration was applied to move in the right direction ie Backwards and then it would lurch backwards in an uncontrollable manner On ringing Centauro Malaga to complain I was told that Yes it was a difficult car to drive but in order to exchange it I had to return it to the office myself Because of the difficulty and perceived danger I didnt want to drive the car again Eventually they agreed to bring a different car out to me but NEVER mentioned a Fee It wasnt until I returned home that I found 124 euros had been taken from my credit card without my permission The company can only say I should have read the small print I WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN and warn others to be careful
The 2 wicker shelves I purchased each over 30 were not of good quality and certainly not worth 30 something If I had paid 15 for each of those shelves then that would have been better than paying over 60 not including shipping either The corner shelves the 2 top shelf hinges are not long enough to keep them down and the bottom shelf is missing the hinge all together I fixed these myself because I wasnt going to throw away any more money by returning these items The canvas tote on wheels was nice but it took too long to arrive I placed my order 122816 and the shelves arrived 11017 and the tote on 11117
Still has not arrived Your shipped said they confirmed delivery However the location was incorrect from what was on the order So now its seems to just be somebodys late Christmas present instead of my much need piece of test equipment
Received what was ordered in a timely manner The instructions were not detailed enough to implement easily Measurements on tools were different than amount to be used
Morning of ski tripdog sickhad to take to emergency vet Customer service told me no refund This is a poor policywill not use again or recommend Liftopia
I never write reviews about companies but I just wanted to caution others about their online practices I made an order and paid expedited shipping thinking I would get two supplements that they said were IN STOCK The day I think Im going to get them I still had not received a shipping notice I contact them and they send me a message back the next day saying they were OUT OF STOCK of both items and would not get the items for 57 daysand that it could be longer I needed these supplements sooner and could have purchased them on Amazon and received them by now Why did I go with eVitamins to save 10 facepalm When I called them no one was available I had to leave a message I cancelled the order via email they do get back to you during business hours BTW I went back to check the supplements to see if they were indeed out of stock and their website said they were STILL IN STOCK I am disappointed and will not be buying from eVitamins again If you need your supplements and want their reduced prices I would not count that their products are in stock when they say they are
I ordered glasses more than a month ago and Coolframes keeps telling me that they have been delivered but that is not true For me a customet service ends when I hold the ordered product in my hands and not when it has been handed over to the carrier
I would like to share some very true facts My wife ordered some product for her sister in Georgia We live in Virginia
We never received a confirmation nor was the soupthree types were ordereddelivered by christmas She made repeated attempts to call them and email them as well No emails or calls were retuned by the company We finally got so mad she contacted pay pal to get our money returned After doing this we received a ship notice from the soup company stating the soup had been shippedfinally
It was revived finally 2 months late Also the quality of the product was inferior and we told the recipients to throw the rest away
I would NOT recommend this company to any one Very unpleasant experience all the way around
I could code your site better my self you should really fire your wix web designers 
Othervise alright but the extra insurance was added into by bill and was really tricky to remove The extra summ would have been almost the same as the rent
2nd time I order this year and still never receive the entire order Guess Ill just keep waiting Maybe items are on back order but I guess Ill never know
too bad services
I booked a hotel in Havana  the price included the taxi from airport to the hotel  when the voucher did not arrive for the taxi I tried to contact Gala hotels  but no replyWhen I arrived at the hotel having paid the taxi myself I was told no booking had been made  tried to contact Gala hotels but got no reply  the hotel also tried to contact them but got nowhere
THEY REPLIED BUT
their reply is odd  I tried several times to contact them but just got a repeated recorded message  El Presidente Roc Hotel in Havana also tried to contact them I emailed Gala hotels but they did not reply  Their voucher number did not relate to anything on the hotel booking system The transfer from airport voucher never arrived I will be interested to see when I get my refund  there have been many public posts saying that Gala promise refunds but do not actually give them
First they asked for PD measurements 3 times then they needed me to verify my credit card by charging a small random amount and then had me email the amount back to them This took almost 2 weeks Then the glasses once ready did not pass final inspection back to the drawing board then finally when they were delivered over 3 weeks later I was out of the country for a month  I still do not know if the glasses are what I ordered I could have gone to a local shop and they would have been custom fitted and made in 48 hours or less
I purchased a plan my insulation day is a week away I was told I could reap the benefits of the mobile app on my smartphone I have tried upwards of 20 times and different variations of shows movies and sporting events and not one has worked I have a brand new Samsung Galaxy S7 and it is saying things like not compatible or cannot open request at this time the app is completely useless and very disheartening the first thing I used through Verizon doesnt work
I was hyped for Jerry this year being a fan of his hit sitcom On day of release I visited Ticketmasters site to buy some tickets A few clicks away I somehow end up on Ticketmaster Resales site due to tickets being sold out Ive never heard of Ticketmaster Resale but as an affiliate of Ticketmaster I thought itd be ok So I bought the tickets during my brief moment of hype
Heres the disappointment  during the transaction theres no reasonable indication as to when youll receive your ticket from the reseller and the tickets listed on the site can be vague ie no clarity on seat numbers It should be made compulsory that a reseller upload copies of tickets when listing resale tickets so at the time of purchase the purchaser has an actual copy of a ticket proof that theres been a transfer of consideration between BOTH parties After this whole experience and after speaking to multiple reps Im under the impression a seller can list whatever they like without actually having the tickets themselves therefore how can a customer have confidence in what theyre buying This policy weighs heavily against consumers and should be reviewed  customer service advisors at the very least should be aware of this and suggest improvementschanges to management
Money to the sum of approx 1200 has left my account for the last 34 months with nothing to show except a pending order that hasnt been fulfilled
Get back to basics listen to your customers read all your reviews carefully as the adage goes the customer is always right  because thisll be the last time I deal with Ticketmaster irrespective of what tickets youre selling
Pls improve the life of tonner
Wow where to even begin No matter how bad of service I receive I have never been bothered enough to write a review But after this experience  I am compelled to warn future clients from ordering from purolator This review takes precedence over studying for my exams Im a university student  that is how bad my experience was
Their customer service representatives are rude incompetent and obviously hate their job Ive spoken to Cassie Donna and someone else who has straight up interruptedcut off my explanation more than 5 times in the conversation My parents spent 75 on their next day delivery service but its been more than 8 days with no sign of the package When calling them to follow up it was a string of being transferred to different departments and after 1 hour on the phone the only solid answer I had received was verbatim for an unspecified reason the trucks were unable to deliver your package Literally that was their answer  that they had no clue why
The package was a care package full of food made by my family My 80 year old grandma handmade meatballs buns and meat sauce for me We trusted purolator to deliver the package the next day as per their advertised service Not only has the food most likely have gone bad by now purolator refuses to claim responsibility and denies even a simple apology At several times of the conversation on the phone the representative raised her voice to me to a shouting level which I had recorded on my friends phone I have every evidence of their mismanagement and poor service I felt mentally harassed embarrassed and belittled to the point where I was shedding tears of frustration
Its time for clients to take their money elsewhere as purolator truly is an apathetic lowgrade incompetent and disappointing service Never never order from them Please for the sake of your sanity wellbeing  stay away
My floor mat on my rav 4 does not fit despite ordering the correct mat for make and model
One of the passenger names got entered wrong and the website would not let me correct
The company vacuumshrink wrapped the book so there is no protection of it during shipping Of course it is cheaper to do so but if the book is damaged during shipping there is no way to know that it could be that it was in that condition before but the company can claim otherwise I would never buy from these people again due to the shipping practises
A positive note the book was what I ordered
A second negative is that they say 714 days but when asked about the location of the book they explained that it is 714 business days excluding weekends and holidays which normally would be fine but should be up front not asked about In fact I still do not understand why something sent inside the USA would take nearly 3 weeks to arrive
Im really worried that this is a scam service they said my package will be shipped in 24 working hours that was on February 2nd and today is February 18th
Four days ago I sent them an email inquiring about the reason for the delay but didnt get any answer My parcel number is U20170202727395
Ill update my review whenif I get my parcel
impossible to speak on the phone
Unclear about where credits can be used
Poor customer service impatient with customers
Pushy and difficult to cancel account
Customer service is diabolical from the day I first signed on with them Very unhelpful they do not want to know  Im leaving in 2 weeks time to go back to electric Ireland I would not recommend Energia to anyone
I didnt have great experience as I tought I would Life Style mixed up my packages and untill now I didnt receive my order
Ive called the costumer service for several times and they tell they gonna sort out my problem but I havent got any answer so far they promise when you buy it that they would delivery your order next day I still with nothing after 8 days of the purchase
I really hope someone can read this and try to help me out
I wouldnt recommend nobody to buy in your online shop
Crystal is a shift supervisor who thought I would be funny to talk and laugh about a customer that she thought was on hold and was not Chewy has several employees that are rude and lie to customers to get them off the phone Its a shame they treat the people who pay their payroll this way Will not be doing business with chewy

After prepaying for the hotel and spending multiple days with Amoma customer support to get hotel confirmation they cannot resolve the issue This is AFTER prepaying DO NOT EVER USE AMOMA AND STAY AWAY FROM PREPAYING FOR HOTELS on AMOMACOM Its a complete rip off
I ordered some EasyFit blinds for out new office gave them exact measurements as they requested and the blinds we received were 15mm too big I know this doesnt seem much but when they are designed to fit the UPVC frame of the window it really makes a difference
After breaking one of the brackets on the one blind trying to force it into position I spoke to customer services who agreed to replace the bracket I managed to squeeze the 2nd blind into position by cutting away some of the rubber between the UPVC and the glass which isnt ideal but have still not received the replacement bracket I was promised so am unable to fit the second blind
To make matters worse my emails are now being ignored

ps Also all my emails to ProBike have not been logged Why not I wonder
This Company leaves a lot to be desired regards customer service and attending to complaintsI would not recommend them to my cycling circle
Customer service was great and very efficient This review is in regards to the 7000 Silver Series Polyurethane ESD Chairs we purchased We purchased 14 chairs total 2 chairs were rushed before the holidays and arrived with aluminum polish all over the cast aluminum bases Ok rushed order I thought I complained and cleaned them up for our cleanroom facility I was promised by PAC this wouldnt happen again for the rest of the 12 chairs When the 12 other chairs arrived some just shy of half were just as dirty and the rest were what I would expect to have to wipe off Beware of product cleanliness if you cant afford to put in your own effort to clean the chairs dont buy
There was no provision for cleanroom packaging whatsoever the cleaner chairs I received had less polishing compound but still had residues of polishing compound on the under rough cast side that I cleaned off laboriously
I will change stars back to 3 if a reply to this states what the supplier is going to do to improve the state of the chairs I dont believe they have the equipment because why wouldnt they have used it on my order or hold it up until the equipment was available

I got my package after 16 day of my order I just tired of waiting for my package I recommend do not buy online
I have decided to return a phone within 14 days as the law allowes me to I had multiple reasons to begin with the broken seals on the package to the chinese applications on the phone itself
Unfortunately I got in touch with Mrs Sakura their sales manager I have never EVER seen worse email communicationThis person cannot conduct a normal discussion english language is their massive weakness and words cannot contain how rude her attitude was The worst customers service I have ever experienced in my life I have the whole conversation and will post it everywhere possible
I have contacted their sales director and one more person that had public email adresses but so far without any answer
Luckily there is a big influence in our company so we can warn masses of people from this seller

I placed a winning bet worth 10 next thing you know they asked me to upload my IDproof of address and a copy of my debit cardI do everything then next day I receive an email statingThe name on the bank statement you provided doesnt match your name on the IDwhich is complete nonsense since I checked the statement and there was my full name and addressI closed my account with them immediatelyYou will waste your money with themAvoid like the plague
FYI TOMTOP is now paying users to post positive ratings on TrustPilotcom SiteJabbercom and ResellerRatingscom
I bought a quadcopter from TOMTOP and waited a month for its arrival only to find it was missing a crucial part  the receiver Every image in the product listing shows the receiver and the description says all you need is a transmitter and goggles I sent the product images from tomtopcom to their support email and stepped into a nightmare
Ive now been in contact with TOMTOP support for a month They refuse to send the missing part rotating between excuses like the receiver is your cell phone noa cell phone is way too big for a quadcopter to carry we arent going to send you a remote controller I already have one It goes with the receiver you neglected to send and insults to my intelligence The email chain shows that it takes a minimum of 4 days after sending a message to get any response at all Theyre clearly not going to send the part Ive already paid for
The quadcopter itself is a piece of crap The camera came prescratched for my convenience I guess and one of the motors had a bad bearing I bought a far better camera for 25
I still continue my battle with TOMTOP but wont be sending any more money to them in exchange for garbage products
Lack of support
Very poor customer experience Paid over 30 for shipping and processing and received order 10 days after order entered Company refused to do anything even after speaking to supervisor Do not buy from this company
Goods not deliveredno tracking advice provided no dispatch notice I tried to contact via email and although I type in my correct email address the I am told it is incorrectbloody sham  Item was paid for on 14 th January 2017 have not had any confirmation or contact since Very unhappy with this so called online company
People are attitudey every morning N they give u whatever they choose to put in your cup The only reason I go here is due to the drive through but its never right unless I make it a point to tell them I will return it if its not made correctly
The one in Vons on Central is fabulous as well as the team on Glendale in Silverlake
I booked a return flight from London to Hanoi for next week so that she could bring me important medication that is not available inn Vietnam The return price was 481 GBP I did not receive a confirmation email I rang them and they sent me another but I still did not receive it not in spam or junk folder so they resent it to another email account To my horror the price said that 150348 GBP had been charged
I rang again and they gave me 2 options 1 They would cancel the flight and give me a full refund but I would not receive this for 5 to 15 working days AND THEY WILL CHARGE ME A 20 EURO HANDLING FEE or 2 Give me a ful refund as a voucher so that I could rebook the flight AND USE THE REMAINING 1220 GBP to BOOK FLIGHTS WITH THEM OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS
Do they really think that I would want to go to them for any further business What about money to live on for the rest of the month I am speechless A disgusting and immoral business Dont tell me about company policy You messed up royally and I have to pay for it
I ordered my daughters prom dress from promgirlcom and there was an error with the debit card Used and it told us the order didnt go through So we did it again using my husbands credit card and the order went through without problem and we almost instantly got an email for the order confirmation about 2 days later we received 2 seperate shipping confirmations on 2 seperate emails one connected to each card this puzzled us because the original order we tried came up error and we didnt get an order confirmation at all this is when I checked my statement and realized that prom girl charged EACH card the amount for the dress I called prom girls customer service hoping that they werent sending us 2 of the same dress  was told they were I understand that mistakes happen but what I dont understand is that They will not refund one of the cards until I pay out of my own pocket to ship the extra dress back to them the error was on their end and it was there fault and now they refuse to fix it until I pay to send back a dress that shouldnt have been shipped in the first place we received NO order confirmation anywhere but yet they still took the money from my account and sent us a duplicate of the dress I dont mind sending it back but I would like to be reimbursed the extra 40 shipping cost This is ridiculous The dress came to just over 200 and we were charged twice and sent 2 even tho we only ordered one We only received one order confirmation This cannot be legal very dissapointed with the way customer service treated me do not buy from this company they will make you jump through hoops if you dont end up happy with your purchase
the CSR told me the flight i wanted was not available and then changed it three times I ended up on a much later flight that COST MORE
I called the airline later in the day and the EARLIER flight WAs available and the price I ended up paying 100 more pp I could have upgraded to main cabin
then i go to my credit card and see extra charges
because they do not understand english that well and speak so fast you are getting played without even being aware Also check you tickets with whatever airline there are sure to be spelling errors that could possibly stop you at TSA checkpoints
I called flighthub again 2 hours after to try and change the time they wanted an additional 300 NEVER AGAIN
I made my order on the 2 of december 2016 they shipped it on the 10th of december and since then my order is missing and they dont want to return my moneyI think i was waiting too long i cant wait any longermy order number is 161201001061573987since the 10th of february live chat isnt workingIlive in Greece

After writting this no one is calling me for giving any compensation this is pure nut thing come guts do skmething about it
The delivery was made to store NOT to the stated address  It took 4 phone calls to discover where my delivery was
After 25 weeks not even sure if their service works they dont respond to my inquiries
 18 days
Theyve now contacted me and are looking into the issue
 20 days
One short correspondence havent heard from them since
I was informed that a portion of my flight needs to be moved because the airline cancelled that flight Flightnetwork emailed me that I will have to contact them if the change does not suit my schedule so I did just that I thought thats alright they still have plenty of time to find me another flight I should just concentrate on school work and not worry about this I trusted that they will handle this well and inform me about the new flight However when there was only a week left before my departure I called them to see if they fixed it but they have not and so I got worried about the uncertainty of it not to mention I was already really stressed out with exams and papers that need to be finished for school It was literally a day before my flight that I got a hold of someone and fix the ticket My trip was supposed to be a getaway from the stress at school but it ended up a problem in itself In short if you value your time and like to avoid the unnecessary stress of trying to figure out at the last minute if you are flying or not then avoid this website
I ordered roses for Valentines Day They arrived on time but the Roses were old They looked horrible What a disappointment Unacceptable for Valentines Day
Went into shop in naas last monday to order top online Got text Wednesday to say it had been delivered Went in on Thursday and they told me top had been given to wrong person and they would ring me when other customer dropped it back Went in Friday and was told by one of the staff I didnt ring you Top was not in Was told it would be Saturday Went in on Saturday evening and was told the lady hadnt dropped it back Asked for my money back and was asked immediately for the receipt by a staff member with her hand out at me despite me being in the shop every day last week looking for top Felt the staff didnt care about me even though they caused the problem and i was just annoying them every time i went in I know the shop is closing on Thursday and it seems they just dont care about customers Audrey OReilly
I made a significant purchase from the They gave me an invalid tracking number Three times I told them that Only response was with the same false tracking number
Now that the package hasnt shown up they expect me to get a statement from the post office that they never delivered a fictitious package to me How ridiculous is that
They cant and wont tell me what has happened with my purchase in excess of 300
They have stopped corresponding with me
Do NOT buy anything from this website
My order number is 1DE4CE8B3B304E4E8F571C5A07FFF568
This is getting even more hilarious They sent the package to Australia I live in Canada And does that name look anything like my name
I repeat do NOT buy anything from DXcom
no more comment
Overpriced and you need to wait a day to get a copy of your return No other service makes you wait
I paid a ridiculous price for an away section ticket for Man Utd at Leceister Three days before the match I finally receive a ticket but its located smack in the middle of the Lecister home support in the Spion Kop I emailed them to enquire what went wrong Of course no response I then contacted the number provided to validate the ticket I was then told they were not able to get the ticket I paid a huge premium for and no apologies offered I asked about a discount or a refund and he murmered 50GBP I gave him my paypal account and chased and of course nothing has ever been paid back Emails go unanswered no tel numbers to dial and then I get a Survey sent to me And despite filing a complaint through the survey I still dont get a response These guys are seriously a bunch of dodgy crooks Typically I wouldnt bother with a site like this that doesnt have a customer service telephone number but I was anxious for a ticket In the end I went with them because their US parent company Stub Hub has been very legit during my past experiences Unfortunately these guys Ticketbis do not mirror the same class and service And yes I made the mistake of ignoring all the bad reviews from prior ticked off customers I will take this next to Stub Hub I validated the ticket in the early going but did not end up attending the game I like to provide vocal support for United and obviously would not be able to sitting in the Leceister Kop end
Do not get roped into their VIP accounts They make it hard to cancel and will deduct money from your account even after your credit card has expired
Just average Service vehicle etc Also disappointed to find after booking that their Queenstown Airport and Christchurch Airport locations are not actually at the airport but located close by and a shuttle to and from the airport was required Got in the shuttle and then another vehicle pulled in which meant we had to wait for the other person checked there car in If time was tight this would have been an issue
If known prior would never have used
Thank you for your response Victoria However my compliant dose not pertain to the cover but the fact that we were charged for damage that had not been done to the car Had we not have had photographic evidence that the car was undamaged we would not have got the money back but even more worrying is that we were told by the broker that Gold Car still say that we were correctly charged
I needed the strapless bra for a wedding I was in the bridal party for and ordered 5 weeks in advance It arrived after the wedding I have never had to wait that long for anything from the internet

FlightHub I just want to share my experience I had today as best I can SCAM or extremely poor customer service is what the readers can decide for themselves I want them to know how my family was affected by a situation caused by FlightHub As bizarre as it is it is the truth My daughter purchased her round trip flight to New Zealand months ago from the FlightHub website Here goes
My daughter called me today from Toronto International Airport at 1230 pm Valentines Day Feb 14th 2017 her flight was at 145 pm and at this point she hadnt gotten through security She was emotionally distraught and crying telling me she didnt know what to do that her hard earned money approx 3000 and dream vacation were gone She had been standing since 10 am in front of United Airlines where you checkin your bags United Airlines would not accept her tickets she purchased from FlightHub she was told that they were corrupt She been on the phone with FlightHub since 10 am trying to resolve the problem she kept being put on hold by a FlightHub rep asked to speak to a Supervisor Even the FlightHub Supervisor kept putting her on hold and then refused to reissue her tickets The United Airlines representative tried to help and called FlightHub same thing he was put on hold when he finally got to speak to a FlightHub Supervisor he got the same response FlightHub was not going to reissue her tickets andor refund her money
I was so upset to hear my daughter crying on the phone She had been so excited and looking forward to this trip of a lifetime spending a month travelling in New Zealand Thanks to FlightHub everything for her was being ruined I called FlightHub and talked to a representative who kept putting me on hold This rep told me there was nothing wrong with my daughters tickets and she had boarded the plane I knew for a fact that this information was incorrect so I replied that was there is no way that my daughter was on that plane because I just spoke to her she hadnt even passed thru security Her plane she was supposed to be on was leaving at 145pm I asked to speak to a FlightHub Supervisor the customer rep kept putting me on hold coming back to the phone several times told me the Supervisor would tell me the same thing told me she was going to hangup I pleaded with her to speak to a FlightHub Supervisor in the end I never did get to speak to a Supervisor While I was on hold I called Air New Zealand to find out if my daughter was on the plane I was told she wasnt By this time my daughter had missed her flight this was confirmed by Air New Zealand The Air New Zealand representative tried to contact FlightHub to no avail Keep in mind while talking to Air New Zealand I was still on hold waiting to speak to a FlightHub Supervisor Air New Zealand told me to hang up on FlightHub call my daughter and have her go to Air Canada to check in for a flight that left at 4pm today going to Houstan TX to catch the connecting Air New Zealand flight Long story short my daughter caught the 4pm Air Canada flight with little time to spare and when she landed in Houstan at 638 pm allowing her only a few minutes to go outside of the Security Zone to collect her checkin bag go back through Security then go from Terminal A to Terminal D to catch her Air New Zealand flight at 755 pm Many thanks to Air New Zealand for helping my daughter with a problem that FlightHub created I understand that ever situation is different
My daughter is not a world traveller and has only flown a couple of times FlightHub has managed to ruin her vacation by causing a traumatic experience she has had no food or time to eat from 10 am until her in flight meal tonight with Air New Zealand
Thanks to FlightHub starting her vacation like this I know for sure that my daughter is going to feel anxious and worried about what will happen next and her flight home not knowing if her tickets are corrupt until she get to the New Zealand airport Her vacation is now ruined I am still feeling the emotional affect of this day I can only imagine how my daughter must feel FlightHub do you have any idea andor care about the grief you caused our family today If this is any example of how FlightHub operates its business readers should consider themselves warned If this happened to my daughter it could very easily happen to someone else
Cheap Chinese rubbish not premium at all
Image and description is bassically a lie

Sent me 3 sticks that dont grow
I ordered the wrong part entirely my error but when I contacted them to see if there was any way this part could be made to work or if it could be returned I received an automated response promising a real person follow up but no follow up was received  This was not an expensive item so I just ordered the correct part from another vendor but would not recommend purchasing from them
My title says it all Also clunky website not user friendly
Good speed of return of emails by a real person
The package was delivered a day before the special occasion and came in a brown box with the candy just thrown in it Nothing how the website shows For the price of the gift its not worth it at all I will never use this service and dont recommend ANYONE to waste theirs
Had a good experience with Opentip they shipped my hats very fast and the hats are perfect for what Im doing with them Great prices
My order was received in a neat and timely fashion but I had to return it because the person I was gifting it to ended up receiving something similar from another family member Thats when the problems began
Their return policy states that my order would need an RMA number which wasnt listed anywhere on my packaging slip I called customer service and got the proper form it was nice to speak to a person wasnt on hold for too long very helpful etc
I get the form fill it out return it wait A week later I receive notice that my return package has been delivered to their warehouse I waited a week didnt receive my refund Since then Ive called customer service three times each time being told that a reminder had been sent to some department and that I would receive my money in 2448 hours After going through this three times I finally called accounting who told me that my order was still under review but that they would go ahead and approve it and that I would get my money in 2448 hours
I still havent gotten my refund
I booked a vacation rent in lake tahoe and that place is strict on refund Me and my friends didnt hesitate because we are decided to go there Unfortunately there is a snow storm coming and we received a lots of warning that this storm is really bad and it says there that around 8feet of snow will go down from a day and road will be impossible to use So we decided to try to cancel it The property owner told us that we can cancel due to bad weather condition but they cant cancel it for us because we made the reservation through tripadvisor So we called them and they told us that they will contact the property owner and call us back after they talk to them The calling back and forth started at 8am until 8pm because the tripadvisor customer service keep lying to us Telling us they will contact the property owner but they never did for first 4 calls One excuses tripadvisor customer service says that the property owner doesnt answer but we called them and they said they never called them and even didnt leave voice mail Tripadvisor cust Serv Told us too that we cannot cancel because the property owner doesnt want to but we called the property owner first and they told us we can 1030am tripadvisor told us their computer is not working have to wait for 30 mins We did and call them back At 1230pm we call tripadvisor again and this time it changed they said they will give us full refund as long as we will rent again within a month to the same house It took us 3months to plan this trip and they wanted us to reserve in 1 month We called the property owner and his answer changed too he said that we need to reserve for a month or two and we asked if we can just pay for cancellation fee he said yes 250 will be the cancellation fee and we approced that but we have to talk again to tripadvisor to finalize everything but the tripadvisor doesnt want to let us go without taking a lot of money from us Around 7pm i called tripadvisor and asked for supervisor to help finally someone answered and work on the issue and finally found a solution she told me that tripadvisor and me will share for the charges and we wil get our refund in 3 business days But but but it changed again after waiting for the refund 5 days had passed and i called them again and now they told me that they will send the case to the higher level The higher level messages me after few days and told me that the property owner is now charging me 380 as a good will gesture and this is full and final settlement that they can only offer I demanded an explanation on how and why it change but now they refunded me only the deposit i made and not responding on me for 2 days already I guess i will lose all my 640 for nothing
It just gives me a lot of stress 2 weeks of stress
Trust me it is not worth it Just use airbnb or go directly to the hotel cabins and rent there for a little much but saves you out of stress
I used cheapoair and i never get a problem getting refunds on cancellation
STAY AWAY from lastminutecom I have been battling with them for over a year to get ticket credit which they initially couldnt find then we went back and forth from them calling me to make a booking over the phone to them not receiving an answer on my endLIES They never called when they claimed they had I spent hours and money to call them from the US to their Australian line waiting on hold to be told Id get a full refund to my credit card and of course that never happened They are now asking me to make a booking so Ill be refunded after LIKE HELL Please never use this site they have cost me more than money but time and so much stress
When I arrived I didnt find my room and I wait around 2 hours until they make other booking but they give my just room while I booked flat 
I recommend to not deal with this hotel unless they solve their reservations issues
promised me 35 off my order and then I did not receive it I want my money back please
I was looking for on line rates but as fast as I clicked OK I had 3 phone calls and another few within 10 minutes from lenders They phoned and emailed several time even after I said I was just trying to find rates
I had a member credit the money already taken out of my account I couldnt use that plus the 30 off presidents day sale That is crap
After finishing the booking process suddenly they charge you an extra fee in my case about 27  for a flight which should cost 74  so in the end it was over 100  They charge also extra about 4  for paymentfee no matter what kind of payment you are doing Although this is common among others companys it makes me very angry
More they send two confirmations and its not clear why In the second confirmation there is a button that you can check in with opodo But in the very long list of flighcompanys MY company German Wings was not mentioned The Helpline says well German Wings and Eurowings are no the same Company for that reason there is only Eurowings in the list good do know But in any case I can only check in 72 hours before flight  no information about this in the email which recomends the opodocheckinservice
Needed a part for HVAC equipment they showed in stock it took 7 days to figure out you did not have it never again
Please be very careful  In 15 years having welcomed more than 50 expats
solved A lot of problems of tenants  never had a bad feedback or a bad experience and still in contact with several  My add was put on line without having watched it first  I have been proposed a booking on a room with the wrong pictures or the wrong price  then with wrong dates  After 1 month I have finally access to my landlord space 3on 4 rooms show booked which isnt reality  I met 3 tenants who all felt abused by SPOTAHOME By keeping in touch with tenants we realized SPOTAHOME uses a double language  one to the tenant a other to the landlord when solving a problem they crated  BE VERY CAREFULLY  co housing is about sharing and living together it is not ment to be a business because it is about people  My health really suffered from these experiences as I also lost a lot of time  and at the end  we had an experience  YES  but not a good one  I can accept it is a Start for SPOTAHOME belgium  but when the mistakes continue To all futur tenants in Brussels  please BE AWAIRE  JCVD To SPOTAHOME  it is really time to get your act together and lurn from your mistakes At this time I really can not recommend you 
The website asks for personal information to verify the payment Those requests are for very personal information that is not in any way shape or form relevant to the actual purchase They cancel deals without any explanation to the reasoning of the cancellation and the refund i recieved will only reach me at 30 days and thats not even sure
Proceed with caution or do not proceed at all
Shortly after I opened an account with Energia I was contacted by an insurance company pushing their product Prior to that I had specifically asked Energia over the phone not to disclose my personal emailphone to any other commercial entity but clearly my request was ignored It will not be forgotten when the time comes for me to choose new energy provider
I was a super loyal Rapha supporter and have numerous jerseys and shorts pants socks etc Bought one of their most expensive Pro Team Jackets a few years ago Its a very warm jacket and I live in Scottsdale AZ I need it maybe 5 times a year for early morning rides The jacket starting selfdestructing after a couple years but still wore it I finally sent it in thinking they would obviously want to fix or replace it Nope Without asking a single question they determined I must have worn it so much that it fell apart from riding a bike and drinking espresso Not their fault Even after providing my explanation and asking for them to reconsider they continue to insult me and agreed to return it to me asis Im super brand loyal and thats the thanks I get Too many other good brands out there to try Those companies cant possibly be any worse

If I could give Zero stars I would I did all the right things and KV Supply dropped the ball I ordered an expensive Rx for my dog one he just started and will be taking the rest of his life  at least several years Placed the order with all the correct Vet information so they could fax for an Rx The next day I received an email saying a package from your order has shipped Great just what I wanted to here after reading negative reviews but took a chance anyway I WAS WRONG A week later no package I checked the email again and what the shipped package was was a coupon sent by email Sorry but that is not a package I should have read the email more carefully the first time I called and spoke to customer service who said they would check on the order with the pharmacy and get back to me I waited all day no response I called back late in the day and customer service told be that the Vet has not responded  I find that hard to believe I called the Vet the day I placed the order to give them a heads up 2 Why didnt someone contact me over the past 9 days So my order was just sitting there until I followed up today I had to cancel the order and will be getting the medication from my Vet at nearly double the price BTW my vet and their staff is very good about recording communications they receive I picked up the medication I needed today and they had no request from KV for an Rx I should have trusted the reviewers I took a chance because I saw that the Sales manager had actually responded to most of the negative reviews I thought that was a good proactive move on her part Looked her up on Linkedin and she has been with the company 17 years I thought Id give them a chance Now Im here writing a negative review and will post it elsewhere I also discovered the pharmacy they are using as of Jan 2017 is called Pets Choice run by Lambert Pet Supplies aka Lambriar who has a history of supplying puppy mills How did KV get involved with them and was there no vetting process All in all shopping for pet medications online has left a bad taste in my mouth Unfortunately there seems to be no reputable suppliers online Buyer Beware

Been playing at PP for a month with no issues until I want to withdraw Then suddenly they cant verify my account Despite sending copy bank statement bank card birth certificate employment ID card I work for local council with photo confirmation of emplyoment and electricity bill Apparently without a copy passport all this is worthless I dont have a passport and not planning to travel
Never had an ID problem with any other company Ive played on so Id suggest theyre trying to make it as hard as possible to get you winnings Avoid
Im only doing this review because I received an email to do so
I ordered ink about 2 weeks prior to a screen printing deadline I received an order confirmation but no shipping confirmationThis wasnt the first time this has happened but I always received my orders from Ryonet within a few days so I thought nothing of it This time though Ryonet only shipped half of the order out Half of my order arrived the day before the deadline Not thinking anything about it I figured both inks were inside the box I set everything up get ready to print open the box only to find out I dont have one of the inks for the job
I contacted Ryonet to try  find out where the rest of my order was  was treated like an oversight  like stuff like this happens when I spoke with the Ryonet rep Im told that the ink I selected ordered charged  paid for was discontinued The ink was still on the site my card was charged  I received an order confirmation At no point did Ryonet ever take the time to alert me that this product was discontinued
Only after stating this did I barely get a sorry about that from the rep I was then told that they can overnight the ink to me but since it was already past the shipping time that I wouldnt receive it until 2 days later
At this point all I wanted from them was a refund  it took convincing to even get that I kept telling him I wanted a refund  he kept trying to pass me off to a manager in hopes to change my mine Finally when I convinced him to issue my refund it then took over 30 mins to process How in 2016 does it take over 30 mins to process one refund
I left a Facobook review  contacted Ryan Moor who only tried to sell me on another type of ink Really dude about this experience  then was told by Ryonet that they tried to contact me multiple times THIS IS FALSE I contacted Ryonet multiple times not the other way around I was told most times that someone would get back to me  that never happened I was never able to get a straight answer from Ryonet management One person would tell me that the ink is still in stock Another would tell me that there was no more in stock Either way if it was still in stock then why did it never ship  if it wasnt in stock then why was I charged for something that was never there  never alerted about
I was never able to find the same color ink in time to get this job done I tried my best but the best I could do was get something overnight  my customer could not wait another day I ended up losing the screen printing job because of this  wasting my time in the process I can take losing a job but I ended up losing a customer who I come to find out had told multiple other potential customers about the experience
I will say that Ryonet did try  make things right financially I will give them that  I appreciate that But unfortunately it wont help me recover from losing this job  the entire experience of what happened I also had to wait for that compensation too since I was told multiple times that it went out in the mail  saw that the postmark proved otherwise
In the end Ryonet lost a customer
your vip membership system is very confusing and makes it hard to make purchases
I cant believe how poor is their service I read many bad reviews and I thought it was just some neverhappy customers I was wrong After almost a month my package is been returned to them Ive never been contacted about and they have no idea about what is going on They keep saying our claim dept will look into this please wait 2 days Its been over a week and they keep saying that Totally useless support
Not very user friendly and have used Strawberrynet for many years This was my worst experience
I was not satisfied with the wigs I received one did not fit properly even when making adjustments to the straps And the other wig was not my preferred style I returned the wigs in the plastic bags with tags and description still attached to the wigs I was rejected a refund because the boxes where not included isnt that what the 20 percent restocking fee covers
Do not believe statements of the kind will ship by Monday if you place order now etc All factory orders will be shipped within 12 weeks and it is not guaranteed that the factory actually has the item in stock My wife tried to order a vanity table from NFM assuming that the table will be delivered shortly but was informed that it will take a month or so to get it When she complained to the management regarding the misleading statements on the web no steps were taken to mediate the problem The statement still shows on the vanity table purchasing option The only difference is that she is blocked from purchasing items  she no longer can buy a table from them it says that the item is not available in her region so I have to purchase it for her Bad style Nebraska Furniture Mart fix your site and start listening to customers rather than blocking them
We went to American Freight because they had a great layaway plan as long as you put 10 down every 14 days you had two years to pay it off After layaway was paid off the bed that we had on layaway for our daughter we were told was no longer available After a few weeks of having them tell us oh it was ordered it was ordered we still had nothing We had to go all the way to Charleston South Carolina from Columbia South Carolina which is an hour and a half Drive each way Once we picked up the bed we got it home and started to put it together and realize they were quite a bit of broken parts We had to eventually contact corporate just to get anything done about this The only way I would ever use American Freight again as if I have cash in hand and Im ready to buy it right then and there other than that never again

We ordered 2 prints from Wall ArtThey were easy to order and arrived promptlyThe prints are beautiful but we are very disappointed with the shoddy workmanship in attaching the print to the frameThe folds on top of the print are clumsy and bumpy It was not folded neatly as you would expect when paying this amount for a printCheaply stapled to the backand not even neatly cutThe centre string to hang it was also stapled to the frame It looks very amateurish We would not recommend your work to friends Our son had a print made for us from Minibox and it was a very professional jobWe expected the same from you
Service is poor
Ive ordered 3 times as I was hopeful that the service would get better It got worse Firstly they dumped my order outside a busy city apartment block and didnt tell me over a Saturday night I inquired about this and they ignored my email The portion sizes are tiny I found myself having to cook up extra things even though I was cooking for 2 The products are not fresh as they would go off about 2 days later They give you tiny portions of meat Its not worth the money I can google recipes that are better for less money Really disappointed as I was excited to try this Cool idea poor service
They never sent back my propety I left in their cardespite they said they would and I did everything they asked me toI sent dozens of e mails without a single reply
The first problem I had was one item arrived late and it was bought in a pack the second problem I have is that one item doesnt work  and the third problem is that the customer service do not answer me any of my 5 or 6 mails
there is no other options than German to book in Switzerland or at least not easy to find

I bought s7 edge dual sim just 3 weeks ago once I get it as I looked it was not the genuine Samsung Phone replica or master copy something like that by typing on the dial pad 06 and 0 and I told them for the refund and they making drama with me which is really bad I paid for genuine Samsung not for the replica as everybody knows that as the Samsung commitment the phone should be water resist or rain proof but its really not working in the rainI am really upset and I like to get my money back as well
My shipment is still in dentenion FDA will not approve release
When I booked it said heart of the city and walking distance to major attractions including Fort Instead it was approximately 12 kilometers from Fort which required long rides and of course additional costs Breakfast light one was supposed to be included in the price but Ashan said that I could not expect that for the paid price No toilet paper or soap in the toilette Also no hot water but that was not promised The room is extremely noisy due to proximity to the busy road so I hardly could get any sleep His mother also rounded up the price so I paid slightly more Overall very unsatisfactory experience
This was my first purchase from UFC and will be the last one till they are shipping the product with YRC Freight That company is a joke A Baker could run a freight business better than they are not to mention that their customer service is good for nothing They scheduled arrival for Friday last week then they changed it to Wednesday this week between 10am and 1pm Its now 245pm and my package is nowhere They didnt call me so I called them I have talked with 5 different agent and none of them could give me an answer for my simple question Where is my package
I dont know if I will get it at all or not but compare with Amazon or other companies I will definitely not use UFC till this freight challenge can happen

Ordered a suit for my wedding from tailor4less After it arrived we decided it was satisfactory and I would have my wedding party and fathers order suits from here in the same color They attempted to order but the color was no longer listed on the site There had been no indication it would be a limited or short run fabric Contacted customer service was told to repeatedly check the site over the next month to see when it is available again or select another color Repeatedly ignored questions asked multiple times about availability order guarantees or help with reaching a mutually beneficial solution Refused to escalate or put me in touch with a customer service or sales manager Would love to have my party order 1112 suits from here if something can be resolved
I do not like TomTop I ordered a elfie drone and they never delivered it I can not get anyone to help me and I will never use this site again and will make sure I spread the word on Facebook That I have been ripped off by your company

Ive made order on 22 of november 2016 Shipped via Landmark After two weeks I try to track my order but receive message Selection of service chosen is International Mail As a result further tracking information is no longer available In december I asked on my local post office there is no any information about my order The same answer was in january On february the 6th I send email to Fanatics support team Answer was Claims regarding lost packages must be reported within 45 days of the ship date Because it is beyond the 45 day time frame we are unable to process a replacement or refund Ive paid Sub Total 11379 Shipping 2495 Total Paid 13874  they coudnt help me to find order or refund my money I think that they didnt send me any parcel only take my money
I do not recommend anyone to order from this store You will be deceived but Fanaticscom will say they not guilty and ask you to leave a nice review
You should be able to use as many intro items as you want I thought I was getting great deals until I went to checkout i called customer service to see what was going on and thats when I was told I can only use one promotion at a time  That stinks This site is expensive without promotions
Booked online for a price then paid more than double at the desk A part the insurance was not in the contract still paid way more
The process is easy enough but I do NOT agree with 710 days AFTER the show dates for seller payment Ticketmaster held the money from my ticket for a month How do they justify that When we buy a ticket from the site payment is extracted immediately Very dodgy
The darn email verificiation wont come thru so I still cannot connect 2 days later with my phone app to view my itinerary I rerequested the activation link at least 3 times
Top Cash Back is ok not great but not the worst If youre ok with fighting customer service for correct accounting of 40 of transactions go ahead and join

If you are new non US BH customer be ready for laborious verification process Ive ordered lens attachment and BH charge me for it but refuse to send my my item unless they verify me Strangely they didnt need to verify my credit card tho To pass verification process they ask me for my FB profile or LinkedIn or university email I send them my FB profile but they said link is invalid  link was correct but I guess my FB didnt have public photos of me I dont know when iI ask BH what was the problem they just reply link is invalid I dont have LI profile but luckily Im an university lecturer and I have my university email Whole verification process took about 7 days
So I purchased phone from Tinydealcom
I received it all OK but sim tray is missing Contacted their after sale support in hope they will send me tray and all OK but I was very unpleasantly suprised Their after sales support was so slow and did not offer any good solution so I had to open Paypal dispute
After I opened Paypal dispute they claim that they have part but will not send me until I close that dispute
Of course I am not crazy to close dispute before I have completly working phone
I want to warn all potential customers of this becouse only fraud company would demand dispute clousre Honest company would send that tray ASAP and gave apology to customer
DO NOT BUY ON TINYDEAL
when I call I can never get through and when I do all they hear sometimes is just noise

Pack and Send online took my booking and my money and did not send a courier to pick up the parcel ended up cancelling and they threatened to not give me a full refund  Rude and unacceptable from the online experience The only thing that was positive were the Franchise owners at the Frankston office who spent a great deal of their time trying to fix the problem To no avail

Awful computer says no staff who know nothing about cars nor part companies their parts catalogue is often wrong changeovers etc Its ridiculous I just made a 150 mile trip for no reason whatsoever as they decided by VIN an expansion tank for a mk1 Peugeot is the same as a mk2 Its BASIC part selling
Part quality is so poor that many times they are not even able to be fitted Ive tried to like this company so many times but have been let down on each occasion and seen so many other customers receive parts which I know are not correct
What I cant understand is why the general public are so gormless because they keep using them
There are so many better car parts companies out there if you just GOOGLE them

Terrible service from Euroflorist for several reasons The flowers I ordered for 140217 were not delivered on the day and still have not been delivered I sent an email to Euroflorist Belgique asking why the delivery failed but have had no reply and when I try calling the phone number the line doesnt connect I will continue to reach out to Euroflorist and expect a full refund because this service is unacceptable
The process went quite well and was smooth However within a week I had to cancel my credit card as someone had used it for large purchases I cant be certain if it was the resale process but that was my only nonregular use around that time
I did two orders 121 I still havent recieved anything at all I have written emails to them and they only have one thing to say it should be there any day
Never use this site I paid for absolutly nothing and they dont do anything about it
I purchased a ticket to chat to Vegas but unfortunately the transaction never went through even though it said it did Paid over 100 bucks more a d the funny thing was I got charged more than what ml the original price was

The initial VIP offer from Fabletics is too good to pass up but when selection your VIP merchandise it turns out almost everything is unavailable That will all be forgotten if the merchandise is as good as advertised For now there is too much doubt to be excited I want to be wrong

More than 35 days for delivery Unreachable delays Coolframes said it could be delivered in less than 10 days Also I had to pay  30 for customs
Booked EZ RENTAL through EZ charged higher rate higher insurance stating because booked thru 2nd company
i received a gift of 35 to use and because i spent just under 30 i was charged on my debit card It doesnt specify you have to spend more than 35 to use this and it reads that the the the gift is taken off at checkout I will now have a bill payment declined because of this i did call and have it canceled but i was advised that its going to be a week before the money is reversed
Unwilling to work with customer on pricing or delivery
Love the furniture but the service was terrible
I ordered three books 2 from Australia and 1 from a UK store
I live in Australia
The UK order arrived first and they communicated the expected delivery well
One order from the Australian seller showed up without communication and in poorer condition than expected
The other order from another Australian sellerjust didnt show up despite stating it had shipped I contacted the seller and havent heard anything back from them
dj dit en haut
So I purchased an item that was reviewed by Matt GranitI bought it for my daughters birthday present and so she could use it for her classes Scientific said it was shipped we did not receive itand they couldnt prove delivery Rather than take care of the issue Scientific screwed around I had to put the purchase in dispurpte and find another simular item They dont make it easy to buy from they dont make it easy to work within short they dont care about the Customer
I should have looked into the games more before purchasing this horrible bundle they sell for a low price just because most people wont care to refund or anything i assume for it being like 2 All games in the bundle are pretty much unfinished pieces of garbage Buyer be warned Bundle Stars will bundle anything together just to get your money Proceed with caution you are probably not getting as good of a deal as you think
After almost three months I still havent recieved my order My email query last month was ignored A very low quality company I cant recomend them to anyone
Im still waiting for my refund
Haha 44 for a quarter tank of gas when it cost 54 for a full tank from empty pffft what a joke
I have never had such terrible and rude customer service experience I was trying to have a discount applied that wasnt showing on my final check out price
I called and was on hold for over an hour only to be hung up on When I called back they said the gentleman who had been helping me went on break and that is why he hung up The agent then could not help me after holding for 30 more minutes said she would transfer me to a supervisor who could not help me either at this point i wanted them to honor the original price and they wouldnt After holding for over 1 and a half hours and with no resolution I asked for a manager who did not help and hung up on me a second time
I could not believe their customer service was so rude and terrible I will definitely never recommend book itcom to anyone
I have order brake cylinder They offer me also DOT4  I agree

I do not recommend MISTERAUTO
You have the BALLS to ask me to review your company and service I ordered a Drone Dec 202016 it has NEVER SHOWED UP I have sent 20 emails and never get a good answer why just PLEASE WAIT A FEW MORE DAYSthis company has a LONG WAY to go to have any GOOD RATING
I purchased tickets to see Coldplay in Sydney on 14 December 2016 through Ticketmaster Resale The tickets were overpriced I paid a total of 69100 for 2 x Gold Tickets I got the tickets and they appeared to be valid if not overpriced as the price on the tickets was about 15000 each
On 14 December 2016 I attended Alliance Stadium to attend the concert and found that the tickets I had purchased did not scan One of the ticket scanners informed me that I was scammed I contacted Ticketmaster Resale about the issue I had and received an email advising that there was no evidence that the tickets were invalid and they cant offer any further assistance
I was scammed
Bad im not buying from here agin

Horrible experiencecompanies like this need to be forced out of businessI could get better service locally from any number of storesyet I chose these guys to save some  Now my funds are tied up until I can get Paypal to allow an escalation These people havent even bothered to respond to my messsge sent via Paypal WARNINGSTAY AWAY The few dollars you may save isnt worth the hassle of dealing with this horrible company Just pick up your game in a local store
The day after dropping off a package in the afternoon I got a call from Purolator asking what was in the envelope I was charged 50 for overnight delivery and the package is still in Toronto I asked for a discount and it was refused The person who filled out the form at Purolator did not write down what she saw that the envelope contained documents Its my fault not hers
I will never use their courier service again
My matter has been with Slater  Gordon since March 2013 I was initially accepted by the Albury office After almost 1 year there it was decided the Wagga Wagga office would be more suited Wagga did nothing and decided it was too hardcomplicated It then went back to Albury Then to Penrith and Im not entirely sure where it is now My current solicitor is very nice but this process is very very slow

I ordered a pair of sunglasses as a Christmas gift for my adult son More than a week before the holiday  other vendors were giving notice items were in or backorder stockinventory and most were shipping in time for arrival by the holiday  with an estimate of the day Frames Direct gave no such information this lack of transparency leads me to never use this site again The frames arrived 2 full weeks after Christmas Buyer beware of course I did order from the site even without knowing the backorder status but when most other online stores are mostly transparent about inventory and shipping Frames Direct was NOT I felt mislead and ripped off
my experience with you guys was really bad because you guys offer insurance for any cancellation and i bought it i had an emergency i call you guys to change my fly i dint help me at all
The merchandise took longer then expected to arrive One product was defective
Ordered a couch on 19th suppose to be in on 25th No Couch

Ive ordered lipstick twice from the website and both orders were cancelled I dont understand why
Some customer service rep decided to put my order on hold because I was shipping to a different location from the billing Was a gift They never told me then called a day later and left a giggly and slightly incoherent message to call them back I did so within 5 minutes of receiving their call but they left early for a long holiday weekend When I finally did get ahold of a person the following week they notified me of the hold I said since there was no problem with the shipping address they had no business holding the item Since it was a gift I asked that the item be expedited The man on the phone did so and told me the item would by a specific date It did not Two days after the date he told me I called back He put me on hold for 20 minutes to look up the shipping and never came back to say he was still looking into it Just dead silence Will never do business with Dior again
Paper work was quick BUT dvla would not let me transfer on line so now have to post so back to old fashion way and can not use my bike till sorted phoned reg transfers only interested to help for30 
Had many many more inquires from R V Trader
I dont even know how these guys are still in business to be honest Theyre so awful They never knock just dump your box on the doorstep There can be multiple cars in the driveway and they still wont bother knocking
They dropped the box off in the middle of a monsoon without knocking of course leaving me with a soggy box and junk inside
They dont update their shipping info Ive had something sitting in Ontario for a week now Just sitting there Despite the fact that it was supposed to arrive 5 days ago
Do they even work Like sorry to actual delivery men out there who work hard for their money but really

Fishpond Not happy and wont have anything to do with them ever again
I put in an order for a relatively trivial little item on the 29th December On the 21st Feb I was STILL waiting for it to arrive despite several contacts and various promises none of which have been fulfilled
For a start I discovered they are one of those companies happy to sell stuff but other than that they make it extremely difficult to contact them The Contact page Leads to a page with a form demanding you sign in or create an account
When you finally go through those shenanigans you find there is no phone number claiming this is a way to keep our costs low
Worse  they want you to fill in forms with various prechosen subjects to choose from  bad luck if your issue doesnt fit And no seriously unhappy cancel this order is not one of them Whereas my product came with a US plug is Interesting
So no direct email and no phone number Translation   we dont want to pay anyone let alone bother to staff a helpline
In order to even contact you I had to go through all sorts of effort to track down an email address
Now I picked them to buy from what I thought was a local business as the other sellers eBay etc were in places like Hong Kong
Funny that
Turns out so is Fishponds seller
Seller
First I heard of a seller was AFTER I placed the order
Ive been and checked  they talk of working with sellers all over the world But they do NOT explain that the business model is pretty much like eBays but without the protection and support you get with eBay So turns out the order is to be filled by someone with a hotmail address hardly confidence inspiring And it doesnt come
First it was supposed to come around the end of Jan Then it was arriving the first week of Feb That turned in the second which then became something like this coming week By which stage I am fed up I am never ever buying anything with them again
Still hasnt come
Last time I contacted them they said they are contacting the seller directly which is what they said last time and suggested I do the same
Well no I bought from them Their resonsiblity as far as I and the law is concerned
Ive now given them 48 hours to process a refund or Im lodging a card dispute with Visa
And all this for something I could have bought from a high rated seller off eBay
I hope they know that Amazon is ramping up its activity here this year They will eat Fishpond for lunch And deserve to
We used Avis before when we visited Namibia Now the internet somehow forced us to use rentalcars We got Hertz Snag here was our tire was deliberately punctured as we ate luncha common con in Khorixas  the culprits then help by changing your tyre without asking and repairing it poorly Then they demand a high price Hertz took 750 to cover the cost of repairing it better A month has since gone and we have not yet had an invoice or a refund The tire was asnew I fear the repairer will condemn it  to his own profit
See above explains it all
This is just unaceptable and dishonest
purchased a product from a site represented as Canadian the price and shipping costs were good and in Canadian funds the product was shipped by UPS when it got here they UPS wanted another 5100 Canadian in additional costs I did not accept the package as that made the price go up over 50
UPS is the worst shipping agency to ship from the US The people at Hudson Reed should think about what they are doing Canada Hudson Reed says to me a Canadian company the price they sell for should be at the door no surprise Hudson Reed did refund me in full no argument at all
I made a booking for 26 January and to this day it still did not get today 6 February
The ocean view is the best feature of the house The cleaning crew did a good job of cleaning the surface areas and preparing the bedrooms and bathrooms
The house is only a 3 bedroom house although it is advertised as a 4 bedroom Someone is counting bunk beds in a 9 X 10 foot room with no closet as a bedroom
Inconvenient access to the house Steep hill
I realize this is a rental house and can understand the marks on the walls and stains on the furniture but this house has the appearance of being abandoned by the owner
Numerous mattresses are being stored in the single car garage which makes it difficult to open car doors once you get your car into the garage
The dune walkover has some completely rotten through boards at the ocean end of the walkover You have to step over the hole
There are cracks in the walls and spots on the ceiling which appear to be due to prior or existing water leaks
Several of the doors to the outside do not close tightly  they have large gaps between the door and the frame Maybe this explains why we had to purchase pesticides to kill roaches spiders ants and salamanders during our stay
The plaster is falling off the ceiling in the small first floor bathroom
What we thought was the neighbors security alarm turned out to be the pool pump making a very loud noise
The exterior of the house needs some cleaningpainting The doors are dirty the paint is coming off the deck and dune walkover the landscaping is washing down the hill
Steve Milo the President of Vacation Rental Pro told me via email on Dec 8 2016 that someone would contact me On January 12 2017 I sent Mr Milo an email advising him that no one ever contacted me On February 1 2017 I sent Mr Milo another email advising him that the property was still being advertised as a 4 bedroom that my review was not included on the website and no one had called
They only referred one and that was John Moore The bid for a new toilet was 1299 Bid for a water treatment unit and tankless water heater was 10999 John Moore guy was a total blow hard and wasted my time I live on West Galveston Bay so maybe my options are limited with Home Advisors but I did not have trouble finding much cheaper on my own

i have placed 9 orders with this company 3 of them have been real so far i have recieved 3 completly fake prescriptions i paid over 300 for and have not recieved the rest but i am sure they will be the same fske quality i was very impressed with this company and after i recieved the first fake prescription john the supervisor jumped rite on it and took care of me so i thought however the replacement order had 10 unmarked pills tested to be a vitamin complex insted of mt 140 order that was suppose to be 50 pills of my prescription much more i can say but will just say though they were a lot different it is not even their fault it is the piece of crap suppliers they use in india that send fake items i really do like kiwi itself its just thst their shipping companies are going to put them out of business sending total wrong snd fake as can be products
Ordered late fall when shipping was to resume Told shipping was held up due to warm weather When it arrived our weather turned bad with lots of snow that hung in until Feb until I could plant it I called to get instructions on how to store it in my garage Graft site was unusual as it wasnt straight and had a knot where it off set Anyway thought it didnt look like other trees I have ordered in the past I assume that it is a poor quality graft No instructions included in package for planting instructions
This clap company
The got some info entered wrong I signed up days in advance and it cause my power to be cut off your fault not mine I tried to get the power back on they said it would take 24 hours I got another company to do it in 4 hours sad when you let someone go who would have paid you money every month for the next who knows how many years
I felt like a number not a customer

Last week there was this promo 35 off till valentines day I was trying to buy stuff online and kept on getting errors during check out I would have tried at least 10 times visa checkout as well as regular checkout i called customer service and i was told there are issues and i should try back the 35 offer will still be honored Again i tried after 2 days and still same issues I gave up
I tried again today  it worked but no 35 offerI would have saved good amount but i dont understand how can the website have issues for so many days
I attempted to have an issue with an iPhone 5 battery fixed by the company Upon receiving the phone back the first time I noticed the new battery never held a charge I called the company and they asked me to return the phone for warranty work I did so and they again claimed to fix it When I got the phone back this time in addition to not holding a charge the phone also began to randomly turn on and off I the contacted the company again and I was promised I would have my phone call returned on Monday of the following week I had not heard from them by Wednesday so I call back and the lady I spoke with would not apologize for not keeping their promise to return my call She did offer to fix the phone again I sent it to them for a third time Again the phone is holding a charge significantly shorter then when I first gave them the phone and I still have the charge from their repair
I received a defective jacket When I sent photogprahs to Keller they agreed that the jacket was defective asked me to return it and agreed to pay the return postage I posted the jacket to Germany and sent Keller proof of the cost of postage Keller received the jacket 2 weeks later
Now it is 7 weeks later and I have heard nothing more from Keller and have not received a refund Keller has ignored 3 emails and when I tried to phone them a message told me to call back during their working hours even though I did call them during their working hours
To try to appear resonable Keller may reply to this review telling me to get in touch with them to resolve the problem but of course I have already tried to do so many times and they have ignored me
I have requested a return slip for two items an I am still awaiting confirmation so I can ship It states the item has to be returned with in 14 days of receipt but I cannot send it unless I receive a confirmation PAlso I dont think I should have to pay the 20 restocking fee for the wig myra due to the fact that the wig looked nor felt nothing like the reviews I read  seen on YouTube The curls were unraveling as if someone prior had already ran their fingers through I will like a full refund for that The wig Ariana was sent to me in the wrong color
Part of my order was canceled due to availability and I wasnt informed until I called to inquire about it nothing was done to resolved the issue
emails came through spam folder also price was sold before communication
Booked a car with AVIS but no immediate confirmation
Later was advised at the last moment that they have found the car with another company This did not give adequate time to reject and source car from another company and thus have to accept the offered company
The car from this company was not acceptable due to dents and lights not working Replacement car was only available after the 2nd day This car was in even worst state than the first althought lights were at least working Bad experience
I accidently uploaded the wrong tickets and didnt realise this until I was notified by Ticketmaster 2 weeks later I was then hit with a 100 fee and a follow up email invoice to pay the fees plus 100 for not selling my tickets I am sure the buyer is also not happy and was very disappointed they couldnt go to the event due to my honest mistake Ticketmaster needs to implement a better process to manage this because I am sure it has happened before Its not a good experience for both the buyer and seller or Ticketmasters reputation for that matter Perhaps an auto notification if the uploaded ticket doesnt match the event description Its 2017 anything is possible

After booking the fight I noticed the departure date needed to be Thursday not Friday I called your customer service right away but they were not able to change the date with out a fee I looked back and checked on the price and it would have been cheaper to departure on the date I wanted Should have tripled check before buying the ticket What gets to me is that I always book with cheapoair and the one time I need a break they cant help me

Not only did they put my dress on backorder but they messed up the address during shipping I know I entered the right address when placing my order because I had to do it twice once for where to ship it and once for my billing information I have yet to receive my prom dress and it has been over a week This dress is almost 200 dollars Very disappointed
After reading some of the online reviews I decided to contact RapidAdvance for a small business loan that was to be used on a small expansion project I spoke with Cameron who all but assured me that they would be able to assist After taking my information I got one email asking for additional information which I provided I then contacted him to followup and was told that they would not be able to do anything for me at this time So now I have a hard inquiry on my credit score which I take very seriously Please be very careful when dealing with this company I wouldnt recommend their lending services to anyone

I purchased the mini Elfie quad copter and only 3 of the 4 worked I did not bother to attempt to return due the past experiences I have had returning items purchased via the web Even having to take the time to complain is a hassle You first need to create an account on trustpilot Really

I made a account on LightInTheBox just to find out the shipping cost for some items I found it to be a little bit too expensive so i decided not to buy it
The problem begins now From that day where i created the account Ive received 47 spam emails each day Of course Im a little annoyed about that and i therefore use their unsubscribe function
That didnt work the first time since i got more spam mails Didnt work the third sixth or eleventh time either
Im still getting spam mails so i wrote LightInTheBox to stop but they didnt answer
My only option was to ask my email supplier to block all emails coming from LightInTheBox
So poor service
Considering I still havent received my package I cant give a fair review I was supposed to receive 4 days ago but now tracking says 4 more days of waiting

i spent over 600 they printed over a picture so book was imperfect after 2 months of back and forth they said it wasnt really their fault and i could have 50 off for one time on new orders so I have 10 defective books I replied as you can imagine I am not happy with your answer and also the time it took for your resolution to this matter obviously because of the blood sweat and tears I spent creating my project I have no alternative but to accept and place another order Your product with the exception of your error was beautiful but your customer service and response was totally unacceptable i will certainly make my negative comments known on social media your mistake  I paid the price not good customer service
Late to event unprofessional customer service to slow and price was not reasonable Will never use again

Have had several bad experiences with Marvin One consisted of myself and 7 friends waiting for over an hour on an order only to find out after ringing the takeaway that the order had never gone through Final nail in the coffin was ordering from a takeaway at 11pm when it closes at 1115pm The money was taken from my account at 11pm and I assumed he order had gone through until I received an email stating that the order was now being put through as a pre order for the following day as the restaurant had closed even though I ordered 15 mins prior Funds in my bank account were low at the time and as I had used the last of it on ordering that food I didnt have enough to pay for another takeaway and so went hungry that night after doing a 12 hour shift at work To add to the inconvenience it then took almost 2 weeks for the money to be returned to my account Throughout this the customer service agents were mediocre with one claiming I had put the order through too late until I showed a screenshot of the actual time I ordered No real apology was given and I was made to feel as if I was bothering them when enquiring as to when the money would be returned I have been using justeat for several years with not a single issue in that time I tried Marvin out as I found the loyalty stamp scheme enticing However after having such poor dealings and several inconveniences I will not be using it again
Booked a flight from LHR to HK in January Shortly after receiving the confirmation email lastminutecom called me to say the booking could not be fulfilled and I would not be charged
Ive now received my credit card statement and surprise surprise I have been charged Ive called lastminutecom to get them to refund the amount and theyre saying they have no record of calling me and as far as theyre concerned the booking was confirmed
Fortunately I booked this on AMEX who have been very helpful and can see that I then booked another flight after this was cancelled directly with the airline so its clear I wouldnt have done that for no reason
Anyway just avoid lastminutecom They are a site of the 90s and that is where they should have stayed
I joined thinking everything I was adding to my cart was at the price in red where it was for the joining member price then when I got to my cart everything was at the regular VIP price not the new member price They also advertised that all leggings were 2 for 24 for the month of my birthday and that did not happen When I added the 2 pairs I wanted the one pair was out of stock even though when I went to add it again it said there was one left Could not get it to work so I added a new pair to get my 2 for 24 deal then all of a sudden when the ones I originally wanted were at full price I could buy them again They were not available for sale price only full VIP price when everything should have been discounted for my first hour as a new member NOT IMPRESSED with the way it was ran Also everything I was interested in and clicking on when I had the XS filter picked was not available in an XS

Keela  Dogvacay Manager
Thank you for reaching out and following up after such a stressful incident Very disappointing to find out that my dog was left alone in a home and much more with the door open I tried reaching out to Alexander via telephone and finally via Dogvacay messenger prior days before going over to his house Unfortunately I was very tied up at work and had a gut feeling that something was wrong I finally had a day off yesterday and decided to drive to Alexanders house to see what was happening I stayed with my dog in the front yard of Alexanders house for about 10 to 15 mins and still no one around to come out from the house I take it Alexander may not have been home at the time and probably left my dog with his roommate I knocked on the patio door and even hit the door bell and nothing I was very alarmed with the neglect of my dog and saw firsthand how easily she could of gotten lost My dog has been with me for 8 years and we consider her family I take the risk and gamble with Dogvacay hosts as ultimately last resort I am currently in between moving homes if not I would not be using your service
Furthermore I am missing some property that I was unable to retrieve from the property Though the door was open is unlawful to enter a home and dangerous The risk was not worth taking and decided to buy two new dog bowls a new bag of dog food new bed and a new leash about 100 that I did not expect to spend I would return to Alexanders house and retrieve my things but I am afraid I am still too upset to even see him in person I also left my dogs medication  Apoquel 160 mg x 30 pills which run me about 310 per pill  93 total Overall you can see how expensive this incident has been for my family Please let me know how we can get my things in a timely manner
You stated that you are still assessing whether or not Alexander will continue to be a host in the Dogvacay community A company that seems to have forgotten what the most important value is in their business model which is to advocate and protect our four legged friends In your own words most rigorously vetted  trusted sitters available  well you have failed Alexander has your 101 dog training certificate and what other certifications you may provide but now hold little value Dogvacay promises to connect dog lovers with one another to find and provide safe convenient and affordable ways for their best friend You offer a great service but by no means is it affordable enough to put my dog at risk You need to review you candidate selection process and establish a higher sense of responsibility from all of them Customers trust in your company and the brand to find a safe comfortable and responsible sitter for our loved ones I see that you have provided a promo code for 150 for my next visit and I thank you for that gesture Fortunately I still have a dog that I can find a sitter for but next time it wont be with Dogvacay Ill make sure to spread my story with other friends whom referred me to your website just so they know how imperfect the Dogvacay community currently is and how much more they need to improve
I do not like that I have to become a member to get this VIP offer Many of the styles are not in stock Promise is not kept that the leggings are two for 24 false advertising
Thats no good
I want to be clear that people I dealt with were pleasant I am however quite disappointed in the quality of the bags I purchased The handles rip way too easily for my application The imprint looks great  no complaint there I will definitely be more careful the next time I search online for a supplier for my needs I felt I should have a discount for the hassle but     it didnt happen I will use the bags because I paid for them but they are certainly not what I needed
I saw a great deal on kiddieskingdomcom during Christmas sales cybex sirona m2 Isize car seat for 210 I had researched lots of other websites and this was the best deal Same description as other sites and all had identical photos with base included I ordered x2 on 241216 and delivery dated stated 040117 Four weeks of waiting emails and telephone calls I was contacted via email that I would need to pay an additional 190 if I wanted the product The company had obviously made a mistake with the price when I bought it but rather than honour the sale made as advertised they said either I pay the extra or they would refund I am appalled at both their poor customer service and the fact they can take my money then ask for more weeks later The price has now gone up to 315 on the website with exactly the same description and photos
I recently booked a Norwegiancom flight via online travel agency Kiwicom because it seemed like a good deal This was one flight out of two I booked together the 2nd being with another airline The Kiwicom website gave me the option like on the Norwegiancom website of paying extra to put baggage in the airplanes cargo hold Kiwicom charges alot more for this option than Norwegiancoms website but that isnt my complaint When you pay extra with Norwegiancom you are paying for being able to 1 take hold luggage 2 a seat reservation and 3 for a meal BUT when you pay extra with Kiwicom for hold luggage it doesnt mention you are getting a meal and it does not provide the option to pay extra for a meal This meant that my 10 hour flight from London to Los Angeles resulted in me not being fed and having to walk up to the galley to ask repeatedly for water despite having paid approximately 65 for one hold luggage Needless to say I have just spent 24 hours in bed with dehydration and a chillfever Is Norwegiancom or Kiwicom to blame Both Id say After contacting both they each blame one another I wont be using either again and I recommend noone else bother because neither are good value if you value your health and sanity Norwegiancom might have a new fleet of planes that look good on the outside but everything on the inside is bad thats why they are cheap Next time Ill pay a little but more to be treated like a normal human being Absolutely no respect for these people
Really hard to get ahold of reps when needed
Dont Answer the phones very bad customer service I Called them as mentioned by them between to call between 900 AM to 1800 PMPSTMondayFridaybut no one is answering my call i Called them atleast 1015 timesWhy is you customer service very very badCant you appoint more employees to attend all calls and respond to them Because people from all around the globe who have placed the order will be trying to reach you If your hotline number is soo poor then it is better you wrap up USGOBUY
I went to book a hotel for myself and my partner through lastminutecom and the booking went through twice When I phoned up to explain what happened I was informed that it was up to the hotel whether or not the room could be cancelled and whether I will be refunded for one of the rooms I was told they would get back in touch with me however they hadnt done so yet I then phoned the hotel and stated that I have spoken to someone from lastminutecom who said the hotel are the ones who need to refund me To be told that this is incorrect and that they dont have my money that lastminutecom do When I phoned lastminutecom back they tried to say that the hotel will only offer me to have the room but to change the date for another time which I did not want They then went on to say that room can still be cancelled and I wont get a refund So I have spent double the price on 1 room Furious Do not use this company
I logged on and notified bedding style that I was returning a spread They acknowledge it via email They did not send me a shipping label I called A very nice lady said to expect it within a half hour 30 hours later I still have no shipping label
I placed an order on February 9 for the flowers to be delivered on February 14 with specific instructions Flowers have never been delivered despite my many calls I was told by your representative that the flowers WILL be delivered but they never did I demand an apology to the recipient and a full refund of the money
Be careful when you pay a deposit
All they want is money
Wrost web to buy your ticket
Good job on taking order But then I waited 3 weeks with no order being comferm then another week I get order but only half of itstill no comformation on order as to went sent
Booked with last minute for the first time in November and have regretted it since I have been trying to contact them with a very simple request since I booked online simply to ensure we have a double not a twin room this simple request has never been an issue with any other company
After sending 6 emails and spending 57 in phone calls I am yet to receive a response or even get through to anyone on the phone
Would strongly recommend to everyone to never ever use this company Looks like I will have to contact the hotel directly which is in fact the job of Last Minute NOT the customer Wish I had stuck with the reliable trusted companies we usually use but will definitely learn from this
RUDE unresponsive and just rude Stick to one of the established delivery places that actually want the business
Your system is not bad but unfortunately orders often takes 23 mths before receiving goods
Its been 25 days since I paid for the boiler fix The engineer still couldnt even diagnose the problem Once they get payment they dont even care how it goes tells me to see it with the engineer
They take the payment in advance without doing NOTHING which means you can pay it and wait for ages to get your service
Avoid this company like the plague One day Shipito company was a great for parcel fowarding but the last few weeks the service has dropped to an all time low You could nowadays even be thankful if they send out your package from the USA to abroad but you have to be aware that the changes are high you will receive the package completely destroyed WTF has happened to this company They simply dont care when you call them they have become absolute monsters They dont even pick up the phone
purchased twice some supplements from them Each time it takes weeks to dispatch  Supplements marked as in stock not send 810 days after payment fully made It seems it is drop shipping company and not a real business trading with vitamins and supplements

Changed to save on costs but more expensive than expected
I measured my blinds and the gaps between the sides are too far despite me measuring exactly
The blinds are bang average in quality Hilliarys fitted my kitchen ones and the difference in quality and fit is miles apart
To be honest I wish I had paid extra and had Hilliarys do the lot
The pull chords are terrible on the roller blinds  not smooth at all
Budget Blinds if I ever saw them steer clear of this company at all costs
Sometimes opticontacts has the best prices when there are promos and coupons and sometimes you have to search the web for better prices
The product is always good and is not a knockoff or some cheap imitation Chinese brand so that is good
They have a good website but I wish they would allow you to upload the prescription on their website at the time of entering the order Currently you have to create your order and then go back to your email and manually email them
My may complaint is that I never received and email indicating the status or progress of my order Have they received the order Have they processed the order Have the reviewing an verified the prescription Have they shipped yet What is the tracking number etc
My order ended up going to the wrong address due to his lack of communication
UPDATE 2062017
I did find the emails in my spam box However at the top of the emails was a message from Google indicating that they put this email in my spam folder because the sender is not following their guidelines on sending bulk emails I partially blame opticontacts for this
In response to opticontacts explanation on the prescription upload my answer is this See how your competitor 1800Contacts does it They allow you to upload the prescription right on their website
Terrible experience Terrible service Sent several messages to ask about status of my order and never got reply Ordered flowers to be sent to my girlfriends office in Kolkata and they never arrived Such deliveries should be made within reasonable hours  latest 5pm But when they rang my girlfriend it was already past 7pm and she was already home They also didnt make clear whether they would deliver to her house instead and were extremely unhelpful and uncommunicative when she rang both the delivery man and the florist shop responsible They even hang up on her and didnt answer further calls Despicable manners and service which totally ruined what should have been a happy valentines day While flowers finally arrived at nearly 9pm this is too unacceptably late and the day and experience were already ruined Ive sent an email to demand a refund and apology but doubt i will get one given their lack of response and all the other negative reviews ive seen here I only wish I saw these negative reviews earlier Avoid this company at all cost Would give them no stars if the system would allow me
Sizes are strange and if you want to exchange nothing is available so you have to wait a month for new items to be posted Then if you dont want an outfit and click that you dont want anything you get charged anyway which is completely dumb Sorry Kate Im telling everyone I know that this is a rip off Ive had many subscription plans before but you dont get charged even if you dont want the item for the month This is basically stealing if you ask me
You need a better plan that wants to keep customers rather than rip them off and they discontinue the service
Not cool
The staff is friendly and courteous but I am always short in product
My order is always prepaid but I always get less than what I order
I am never told items are in back order Its just short and marked as full order shipped Not sure how long this was happening since parts werent being counted when we received Even after I caught it it still continues to happen  I continue to have to wait on product that Ive already paid for I reach out to customer service and they ship again and for the second time on the same order its still short
I had to make the order 3 times and every time it gets cancelled and finally I had to call so you approve my order what kind sh
No option to cancel order and the hold time on telephone is over 30 minutes
I Paid to have my Samsung s5 unlocked and still havent heard anything back and its been 4days now Anybody else have to wait this long as I can see through some of the comments that mostly it takes up to 15 minutes
Labels way too small
Order not completparts are missing  Man on the phone says that there is mistake on the website  not my problem and sorry about that  I can send back if I dont like or buy missing part  Not recommend waste of time  I waste week
Honestly the worst online shopping experience Ive ever had It took 2 weeks for these cretins to even bother shipping my bands which I obviously paid for at the time of order in that time I tried calling and emailing and never received a single reply of any kind
Once they finally shipped it took a week to arrive the fast shipping they claim couldnt be further from the truth
Overall 110 would not recommend to anyone
It was easy simply to order
I called the technical division at direct tv to tell them dish is better and was wondering if it was technically difficult to get a minority over 65 years old woman or man can get a deal and they are wanting to charge 1300 for the advice of a technician At least dish dont charge even though Im charged the same price as a billionaire
I have topped up for 100 mistakenly as in the topup option it is near 100 I just touched it then my 100 gone I asked for refund no reply from them dont believe rebtel app
Bravofly is terrible Never book with them I have been waiting for a refund and a voucher code that functions for 15 YEARS This company has tereibel customer service and does not follow through with its promises I call them and they always tell me Ill be contacted within 48 hours which now I understand to mean NEVER I have asked to speak to someone higher in the chain of command and customer service reps just tell me they cant transfer me This is crap and I am LIVID They owe me a voucher and 4000 I had to spend on tickets I had already paid for Get it together BravoFly YOU SUCK
Delivery is slow if the product is faulty you have to send it back at your expense and probably outside the UK Took me ages to prove the product was faulty but they still refused to collect saying I would get my refund after they had received the product but since shipping costs to Poland cost almost as much as the product 22 why would I do that not being confident I would get my money back after reading the other reviews The correspondence has been going on for 2 months and I am now resigned to keeping the useless product
Your price is ok but because we know you and we can trust that you will take responsability if something went wrong It was the last 2 orders from that both of them went wrong One was lacking of quality control The sleeve was closed with sewing thred The other was used second hand already once washed product
As I Sad I know that your shops exited and we bought your items quite often so we like Bomont But please take care that you will give your on line customers We got no chance to pick up the right one so we do hope you will do for us
I was guaranteed 51 for two books that I was selling and received an email saying that for one of the books they were only giving me 1 instead of the original 25 I couldnt even get the book sent back to me cause I wouldve had to pay an extra 8 There was nothing even wrong with the quality of my book and the ISBN was correct Absolutely ridiculous Dont use this website
so bad no support for error item
I bought an item they sent me an error item I request support many times but they did not support me the system only send me the chinese email no support That is first time and the last time i buy something from tomtop
Myself wife and son booked return flights from Belfast to New Zealand to visit our other son
We received our confirmation immediately so started making preparations such as booking car hire accommodation etc
Two weeks later we receive this email
We regret to inform you that due to a fare filing error your ticket was advertised and issued at an undeniable and recognisably erroneous fareand the airline has therefore annulled it As a result of this we regret to inform you that your booking has been cancelled
Please accept our sincere apologies for this inconvenience Rest assured we will immediately refund the entire amount that was charged for this booking via the same card you used to make the reservation Please note it may take few days for the refund to appear on your accounts statement
We contacted both Quantas and Aer Lingus to find that our tickets were actually still booked so we went back to last minute and asked them what was going on
We were again told that it was the airlines that had cancelled our tickets and even though we had screenshots and verbal confirmation from the airlines disputing this last minute insisted the airlines were lying
We have received two further calls from last minute one stating that last minute cancelled the tickets and one stating it was the airlines that cancelled and they also stated that in their terms and conditions they could change prices if theyve made a mistake
It also states in their terms and conditions that when you book a flight with last minute your contract is with the airline so I find it hard to understand how last minute was able to cancel our flights maybe they hadnt paid the airlines for them
After advice from CAB we have found out that under Civil Aviation rules we should have been offered the chance to book an alternative flight if indeed it was the airline that cancelled the tickets or a refund
Armed with these details we again contacted last minute to ask why we were not offered alternative flights from the airlines last minute immediately refunded us within 2 hours while still insisting that they had no part in cancelling our tickets and told us if we wanted another flight we would have to take it up with the airline
The matter is now being handled by both the CAA and ABTA as apparently this is a regular occurrence with last minute advertising flights at prices which are just designed to rope people in and then when youve made all your travel plans they hit you with the badly spelled email which we received above forcing you to spend more money
Recently bought a Cloud Pen Chloris to have something portable There is either something wrong with the heating element or something because I get very little vapor I use exceptionally high quality material and after a half hour of vaping it does not seem to heat the material enough to get a good vape Hardly any smoke I always take whats left out and smoke it in a pipe I have sent the pen back so they may see if it has any problems Your material will also taste terrible for quite some time due to the plastic mouthpiece I wont know my final opinion until I hear back from VaporNation hopefully next week Then I will let you know how it all plays out In the meantime dont buy one
I would put a 0 star if this was possible In reality we choose Thalys because this is the only existing option to transit between Amsterdam and Paris and there is no existing competition from Ryanair or Easy jet YET
Besides being highly pricy the trains run in an unorganised way from Amsterdam central or Schiphol Meaning no clear display of the platform until 5min before it arrives and I am generous here No Thalys staff to guide you either For example today my train overall stayed 1 min on the platform for a 16h34 schedule from Schiphol to Paris and I missed this 135 euros train today like that Less than 1 min later it was not displayed anymore and other intercity trains ran on the platform I had hope that the controller for the next train could have some pity as i was told at the Thalys counterbut he made me pay 124 euros for the same trip
Trip where I have no seat assigned and on my receipt it just says no ticket Like an outcast that fraud to be on this 0 star train I am pretty angry and disappointed of the lack of compassion and understanding
In clear you pay 259 euros for being sat next to the door and also told that they cannot do anything for you That this is your Fault
AVOID THALYS better the car sharing having nice people respecting you 
I had a horrible experience trying to change my return flight date Kolkata to Toronto The customer service rep Ashley kept me on hold for hours while manually calculating the fare She initially told me I would need to pay CAD 489 for a change of return date and after I gave my credit card details she got back saying that she had made a mistake and actual fare was CAD 735 which is almost the price of a new one way ticket I wanted to speak to a supervisor and she put me on hold for ages before the line got connected to a voice message from China Airlines Horrible service I will never use Flighthub again and urge my friends not to use them either
Ordered for the UK and Royal Mail would not deliver my package until I had paid 16 worth of customs fees Surprisingly enough this wasnt mentioned by Cool Frames prior to my order
My last bills for Gas and Electricity were higher than the immediate past ones by an order of magnitude even though our patterns of use have remained largely the same and Ive been travelling quite a bit leaving less people at home Im far from stoked
I have sent this company 6 messages now and despite the promise on its website that it will answer within 24 hours I have yet to get a reply to the ones I sent 3 weeks ago Even the ones I sent during the Live Chat period which I believe is 9am to 4pm come up as sorry we are not online at the moment but still no reply and these were sent a week ago
I am questioning if this company exists and if it does what its response would be to someone trying to resolve a problem under its 3 year warranty
Shocking
When I received my order on 21317 I received 1 meter even though the packing slip said I had been sent 2 I called customer service on 21517 and spoke to Judy She questioned me over whether I was sure that I only received one and said that she would have to talk to the warehouse to see if the weight was such that I only received 1 instead of 2 She assured me that she would check with the warehouse and get back to me I never received a call back The morning of 21617 I tried to call Judy again but was put to voicemail I left her a voicemail and still never heard anything back I called customer service back the afternoon of 21617 and talked to Susan She checked my order against an order for 1 and saw that the weight corroborated my story and said that she would look into the issue with the warehouse and call me back the next day The morning of 21717 I had not heard from her so I called customer service AGAIN and talked to Jamie She said Susan was out sick and that she would look into it Finally she called back 2 hours later and told me that the missing meter had been shipped out way back on 21517 even though I was never informed One simple phone call or email on the first customer service reps part would have saved me HOURS of frustration
Anything is better than Purolator They gave me an expected shipping date through the tracking  and then they tell me it wasnt even out for transit the day it was due
PS this is not the first time I have issues with Purolator
Ordered 2 parts only received 1 When trying to reorder the part again I kept being diverted to a French version of the site and as I do not understand the language had to give up Ordered from another car parts supplier
At first after submitting our application we were contacted quickly and were promised some quick leads based off of our info
Brian Jewkes however after 4 days of communicating giving me updates completely disappeared and I have not heard from him in 2 weeks He does not reply to emails he does not answer my calls In addition I called the main number to explain the situation and say I would like to cancel my application The lady took my info and said someone would follow up with me I have heard nothing Needless to say I have lost trust and feel very sketched that Lendio has all our info and has disappeared
Valentines Day Flowers I ordered from FloraQueen not delivered to my girlfriend in Holland
Gosh its not as though they have enough of them over there
Youve taken my money and not replying to my service request submits
Let me speak with a human being and dont hide your customer service contact details
I must admit the clothes are have pretty good quality besides the one hole that I had in the side of my leggings and comfortable with added style However since you can walk to your nearest target and get the same deals there is no reason for fabletics to have such absurd offers and prices after you sign up The first month seems like a good choice but its all downhill from there
Wiggle appears to me as a perfect place to order quality gear for sometimes very high discounts especially during sale For me as a complete newbie to road cycling it was a rather unpleasant experience and I would not recommend it You risk a number of unpleasant surprises see below My advice would be to go to your local dealer get advice and support and maybe buy spares and accessories at Wiggle
Why
 First and foremost YOU HAVE TO PAY IMPORT TAX on you purchase if its more than minor bits and pieces Ordering a bike is impossible without customs This should be clearly stated in the wiggle pricing I had no clue of that as I ordered on an Australian site and got a price in Australian dollars How should I know that they ship from Britain That is hidden very well in the fine print I gotta say that aspect is close to scam
 The returns policy is very tempting No sweat You can return it for a full refund or exchange everything sounds super easy and guess what the written returns policy fails to mention that you have to pay for the return postage You have to watch the embedded video to hear that And that video starts with the same words as the written policy so why would you watch it Ordering for the first time I ordered a couple of things in different sizes as I need to try and guess what none of them fitted and I paid big dollars to send all that back to NSW
 Being new to all I ordered a set of pedals SPD and shoes SPDSLSPD that didnt work together as it turned out that the SPDSLSPD shoes needed a special adapter to be used with SPD even though they were specified as SPD compatible Wiggle doesnt sell that adaptor and a local dealer found out for me that it doesnt exist in OZ Yes this is due my lack of knowledge  experience but some more use guidance could maybe help
They took pictures of the two dash cams that I purchased through Amazoncom Wanted them shippted to Canada They stonewalled me for weeks and told me they could now not locate the items to ship them
There are no supervisors or claims department despite their webiste claims Just a fraud company that pays iteself by keeping your packages
Recently I made an order from the online boutique of Dior and for some reason that I never understood my order was cancelled Even so they charged the amount from my credit card and still pending Im very disappointed of this website I wouldnt recommend it to anyone
Firstly my original order had 2 items The website said it had the items I requested in stock then I was notified to say one was out of stock swimsuit I then changed cup size of the swimsuit I ordered as I was told by customer service that the next one was in stock I was again notified to say that was out of stock and couldnt be reordered from the supplier Although the web page continued to say it was in stock So a refund for this item was to be issued only the whole original amount was refunded instead of that one item I had to organise payment again for the single item I was waiting for a sports bra After 3 weeks of waiting and several messages to customer service I was told that the sports bra which was in stock when I originally ordered it was now out of stock I was then told I had to wait another week before it would arrive at Zodee for dispatch as someone forgot to order it in the order that was placed the day before Finally the bra arrived 2 days later and wasnt missing off the previous days order like I had been told I am very frustrated with the service I received as a result of some obvious miscommunication in the warehouse
I made a first order in December 2016 and the package arrived quickly in just 4 working days without any problem
However I made 2 new orders in January 2017 and after 30 days I still havent received any of them
I contacted the post office nearby and they confirmed nothing was received
I sent an email to the Crazy Factory Customer Support team and they kept me updated once telling me there was no way for them to track an order once it was sent I contacted them once more to check what else could I do to find the order and they didnt reply anymore
I understand it wasnt the companys fault and perhaps the packages got lost in the mail but it was too much for me that 2 orders got lost accidentally
I might consider using them in the future but only if they add a different shipping method FedEx DHL etc that would allow tracking the orders online
Overall didnt make much progress towards getting a blog started
I found it difficult and only by making several calls to be credited with the promised switchover bonuses
There hands been no response to my emails con concerning my 2 Android tv box F7 the order has been placed since 2017124 its still under processing
I placed three orderes Two of them got here late  but the correct item
I received two books in the a language I cant even read Such a waste of resources
I was shown one price on their website and I ended up paying 4 times the amount when I arrived at Tenerife airport
nothing against there products but i recently made a purchase for 170 and have just checked my account and have been charged twice now i am been left to chase up my own money even tho it was their error
Items never arrived and I asked for a refund they responded to offering me one because my orders got lost in the mail they said I said yes and they havent responded back and I have no refund 
I ordered 3 lights in October 2016 2 of them came in 1 week About the 3rd one
I checked delivery date  they said  November I was ok to wait one month In November they changed it to December them to January and than to the first of February And finally Today they changed it to the first of march
I send them messages and all the time they said that it is world wide problem with Philips I do believe but please let me know this in october I was waiting for 4 month This is insane If they knew about this issue why just not call me and say that they can change the delivery time up to 4 and more month I am very disappointed
But it would be fair to mention that the first and second light were ok as expected
When we first joined Verizon Fios a short period ago we were pleased with the services The OnDemand options did not compare to Comcast but we were willing to give up a little of those options in order to receive better service Recently Verizon Fios changed their system and OnDemand program and now the choices have slimmed down dramatically Especially for the Starz OnDemand The program is much more complicated and slower to use as well Not happy with the changes at all
Ticketmaster Resale is the worst ticketing website I have ever dealt with I spent nearly 1300 on tickets to a concert that I didnt end up seeing because I didnt receive the tickets I dont appreciate money being taken out of my account 4 months before the event with only a confirmation email to show for it I also dont appreciate being sent a generic email merely citing the company line when I request a refund This is not an acceptable response to someone who has just lost such a large sum of money Stop hiding behind online form submissions and start communicating with your customers
I used to love apple products After experiencing the horrendously frustrating support  Ill take any other product instead Staff are rude and unhelpful About on par with Telstra customer service  meaning its crap and does not exist Utterly utterly painful experience Microsoft Im heading backwards your way  I give up on apple

Received my order from OL and its missing both the shorts that I purchase and the jersey I bought is missing the Ligue 1 badge that I paid for Im emailed customer service now 3 times with no response and its been a week Im extremely unhappy and will now contact my credit card company since OL doesnt want to help fix their screwup
My package arrived without all the products order When I called customer service I was told I needed to take picture of the items I did receive and email to them Let alone they already had my order and ID order What if I didnt haven a camera to take the photo  Just know reason why I was treated as if I lost something from my package Then it went took another week to receive the missing item after having to already wait a week So my lost item wasnt even expedited Never again will I order with them again
The flowers were not delivered and when I try to log into the website it wont allow it ive tried using their contact form to complain but had no reply in several days now I can only assume they have gone bankrupt as this is what companies do in these situations I will be chasing up a refund via my credit card Floraqueen you are terrible I will make sure everyone knows of my experience
The way Interhome distribute keys to appartments are very unflexibel  have in the two occations that I have used them been waiting in queue for 45 minuttes in order to get the key  this is not what you are in the mood for after a long travle to the destination
My order was delivered to the wrong address It took 23 months before I received the replacement Giving them one more try
Never use this most incompetent lying company They make up their own bunches or
packages not what you ask for their courrier doesnt attempt to deliver and emails left unanswered to an extend they partially answer and leave main part of your request ignored Surprise order from Australia to France was not delivered My sisters family had to go pick it up themselves It also did not contain what i ordered
Ps their comment below is not really true I have paid my phone bill to call Spain most of the time myself and their offering of 10eur refund and return customer discount are beyond funny The only satisfaction I got out of it is that due to their poor service they had to get a new bunch of flowers ready when my sister went to pick her gift herself to the neighboring town Saying that everything was dealt with to your satisfaction is big exaggeration
Worst Service I ever experienced What a Load of Crap
14 days since product was ordered and paid in full
STOCK CONFIRMED  via tracking and email
Contacted directly via phone and told that the stock is confirmed and will be received at vision direct early this week for distribution to my address shortly after
Your item has been confirmed and will be shipped to you within the next 59 days
Today new email received stating DELAYED
There has been a delay in restocking this item It may take 1 to 2 weeks before arriving at our distribution centre
So
Was the ordered product ever confirmed stock
Was it actually on its way to the distribution centre
Or do you have no idea whats happening the actual order and make the status up
For your convenience your order can be tracked 247 at our online Order Tracker
Not very convenient when the status isnt the truth
Very poor
grasscity is not trust worthy
i do not trust them they seem shady and i regret ever ordering from them
i would sooner let them keep my money from my order then even have to talk to their terrible customer service
instead of helping me and giving me answers they seek to confuse me more it would seem everything they say is cryptic at best all i want is a real answer not some robot responding telling me useless info i already know
i had a real order number bet ya didnt see that coming erza
When asked to read metres and they are left on your phone messages over a weekend  they should be read and not get any further requests from you the reading metres
I have been charged for a hotel booking that was never confirmed I have phoned the customer service several times but they are hopeless at answering my questions
Definitely a bad move trying to unlock my iPhone 6 with them They charged me 70 and took the money straight away and told me 3 weeks later that my phone is still not unlocked and I will get a refund I chased them this entire time and all they said is that my phone will be unlocked soon
I DO NOT RECOMMEND
If you lost your dog with this device good luck to found your dog back  The GPS is not accurate at all Very disappointed by the service its a waste of money But you know it only once you registered
Making a reservation with Agoda was such a bad experience
Dont look at the price they show when you make the booking once the reservation is confirmed and its time to be charged on your credit card because of the rate exchange the final amount will change  and I am not talking about taxes etc that in my case were already included
Last time I had a rate discrepancy of more than 30  
Next time Ill use Bookingcom
At least you pay once you check out and you can show your reservation and the price agreed
Agoda never more

We purchased this small blind for our downstairs toilet and the quality is noticeably worse than every other blind in our home The slates are wafer thin and the fittings are cheap and nasty After putting this up it looked of such poor quality I removed it and replaced it with one from a local shop which looks far superior Avoid unless your on a very tight budget Very disappointed
I was told at the check in counter that I do not have a ticket because I have not paid for the ticket  My ticket was purchased on line with credit card She asked if I had a bank statement to prove when I am an international passenger I showed the booking confirmation email from TAP printed out Counter agent gave me a number to call 901 11 6718 Using an international phone I made the call only to be not answered that I showed to the agent She sent me to TAP office who like the counter agent said I dont know you have to buy a new ticket Upon repeated requests she called TAP and after 40 minutes of breathless moments said someone at TAP had forgotten to make some entry and hence the booking was auto cancelled which she rectified This is an unreasonable experience for an international passenger If ever you purchase a ticket on line you may need to carry your credit card statement to show it was paid Also they may cancel your ticket and not notify you at all
Used to be my go to site for Saab parts Last two orders were messed up Needed a part ASAP Part was in stock so I ordered and paid an additonal 38 for overnight shipping Part arrived 4 days later and was not shipped until 2 days after purchase from another supplier Second part I ordered took over a week to get here because once again part was not in stock even though the site said they had 3 in stock Prices are not the lowest around so it was a no brainer to shop elsewhere from now on
I joined up with Costa bingo last year and im not impressed as its the same names winning the jackpot games aswell as the cheaper gamesi have noticed gibraltor runs the site so you notice the same names that win are on gala bingo tooslots are fixed as those reels dont spin right at alljust eats your money and hardly ever payout anymore than 6p a win sometimes a little more but takes it back a more the online bingo site ran by gibraltor should be invetigated fully as they are a big fix in my opion folksstay clear from gibraltor as your never have a dream win they will make sure of that

I never expected that i will be having this kind of experience after booking flight booking with youi booked 3 tickets to melbourne and paid as soon as booked my tickets online i booked it on 17th february 2017and next day i received an email that my surname is too longbut i entered all the details as indicated of the pasengers passports
And i replied that my names are right and you sent me an automatic email that you will be replying me within 72 hours with the booking confirmation
But on 19th february i received an email that my booking has been cancelled due to unavailability of seatsbut when i was checking still the flight seats are available 
After informing you that still the seats are available your reply was that you will be refunding my money within 1015 days
Ohh what a bad experience  when can i have my refundand i had to waist more 3 days to get to know that my tickets have been cancelledbut you have deducted my money on the spot when i make the booking 
What a bad experience
Refund my money as soon as possible and dont ever do things like this to peoples againplease dont break their faith and dont make them confused 
Took hours and a lot of emails to get the account activated Very annoying process Most of my colleague had similar issues
I received damaged furniture Manager  employees do not return phone calls and change what they promised you
I recently ordered 7 Randy Wayne White Randy Stryker series books and they were delivered in 3 separate packages  they actually came from 3 different cities First of all only 6 books were delivered Four of the paperbacks in the first 2 shipments are in poor quality They are well worn yellowed and the covers are ripped or bent The 2 books in the last shipment are in perfect condition and it is difficult to tell that they were even used at all All of these books were purchased as a gift for my husband so needless to say I felt a need to apologize to him This was my first experience with Thrift Books so Im not sure Ill take a chance again
My flowers arrived looking rather sad and dated rather than how they were displayed online
Once I complained I did however receive a refund

Dhl is one of the worst delivery companys here in Austria some time you have to order with them for fast shiping 
In last five orders that I make with them one was delivered to wrong person I hade to go to all neighbors to ask finally I find the packet one month later 
The other two times they dont find me and charge me for shipping for returning it back ps On the packet it was my telephone number and the adress it was right I was waiting them every day in hous plus was call the customer support and please them that they ask the driver to call me on telephone before come to I can show my hous the driver never call me  The other two times they stop the delivery on costumes wanted double the shiping cost is workers from Dhl that Paid extra for every packet that they block on custom for clearance if they believe the packet is under praised the fast shiping then get double cost and you have to wait long time to get refunded for the product why is will stay on costumes for a long time after they have to send it back they have to charge the time that it was staying in thems store and and
I always have to email the rep to ask for a copy of my bond and he acts like its so much work to get it to me
Also just recently I asked if we got a bulk discount if we purchased bonds 4 or 5 more states while asking for Quote s for these bonds and he responded with some obnoxious response that no they dont offer bulk discounts dont I know how business works
Well I know enough about it to know they will probably lose my business I dont know if I got a bad rep or what but there are plenty of businesses out there willing to offer bonds and I dont need to deal with idiots like that
One of your workersMatej Sismanovicpromised me a bill of 50 a month for 12 month without any changes I told him that its 4 of us in apartment and he said that no mattersit is no chance to have bigger bill
I convinced him to put me on 74 a month what he agreed and he told that electricity is so cheap at Energia that is no chance we will spend that amount on monthly level After few monthswe got credit to pay of around 100  extranow after 12 monthwe have to pay around 400 extra what means that for a 12 month contract we paid electricity around 1288 what is 35 more I am very dissapointed with empty promises and we changed our electricity company from this month
Called 3 times in 3 weeks regarding my order kept being told items were in back order the 4th time I asked for the owner  the items were there and were then sent if I didnt insist on speaking to the owner it would have been a crappy Christmas
I will have to call a locksmith to cut new keys

Ive used onesimcard for several years They have improved the annoying delay that occurs when you are having a conversation last year it was almost unusable in certain situations They offer an alias  alternate local phone number to make it cheaper for others to call you while you are travelling But the problem with this feature is that the number receives many spam calls  I am currently getting around 4 or 5 of these per day This is extremely irritating The overall cost of the service is reasonable which is why I use it If they can solve the spam problem and further reduce the talk delay time then I would give it a higher rating
I was thrilled that they had the part in stock I paid for priority shipping and expected to receive it in 2 days and scheduled the repair for the following day It came in 5 daysthe same day I was leaving town Now I have to wait until I return and reschedule the repair It was an inconvenience to myself as well as the mechanic Very disappointed
I have been unable cancel my cruise due to work commitments I have called the number provided dozens of times and left my contact details no one ever called back I tried to email and the links to email would not allow me to do this there was no option on the webpage for cancellation this organisation should be shut down I would strongly advise against using them
Used to love my case on iphone 6 Once I upgraded my phone and got a new case I have had the worst luck No one can hear me when Im on speakerphone unless I take my case off SUPER ANNOYING Switching brands
Ive used this company so many times NEVER AGAIN I used them to book a hotel for someone else as a present It let me book  pay upfront Yet when they arrived at their hotel they had to pay for the room aswel I called booking who told me the hotel had refunded me yet when i checked they had only refunded half The worst part is my guests had to pay for their own present So out of order bookingcom When I spoke to bookingcom  told them that I had only been refunded half the woman on the phone julinter told me I had been refunded the full amount she was very patronising which made me just want to speak to a manager she refused  told me she was going to put the phone down on me And did So I called back almost in tears asking to talk to a manager about what had just happened on the previous call She refused also  put the phone down I will never use this company again DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY Im so disappointed in how they treat their customers Its disgusting
I placed an order back in August 2016 the order was completed and I returned an item the return was processed I got a notification in February 2017 that the same order was being shipped to me I reached out to Chinese Laundry several times by phone and also sent an email asking for clarification on the duplicate order that was never placed and was sent 6 months after the actual order was placed and never heard anything back

Very poor business practice
Booked a hotel in Venice based on our needs and requirements  Twin beds  next to a water bus stop  close to parentsgrandparents memorial
48 hours prior to booking I received a message to contact Amoma urgently after 45 minutes on hold I tried the book a hotel option on another phone line and got connected immediately I was offered an alternative hotel which I had to accept or be issued with a refund  I was travelling with my elderly Aunt and could not risk having no accommodation The Hotel itself was nice but double bed only a 1015 minute walk from the water bus and over a mile away from the Hotel we wanted
Overall a very stressfull start to our visit  I would not risk booking with Trivagoamoma again
All of our travel plans from the airport etc were turned upside down
The reason we were given for the change in Hotel was refurbishment I called in to the Hotel we should have been staying in and there was no sign of any refurbishment taking place
terrible customer service located in romania
Price of the csr was fair good but at the counter we have been somehow forced to contract the insurance to cover all risks
The price of the package was ridiculously high this just to justify their low rates and make profit on insurance coverages
A restaurant cancelled my order for not answering my phone
Not only will you be charged over the twice the price that the garage would charge you independently Service stop will also tell you that additional work needs doing  this additional work is made up by them for extra revenue and is not work that has been recommended by the garage We will never use them again
We are happy to pay for good service but we are not happy to ripped off and lied to
My advice is to directly use a reputable local independent garage
Even D1ck Turpin had the decency to wear a mask This company should be closed down
AVOID AT ALL COSTS OR FACE THEIR FULL INFLATED COST
 Thanks for your response which does not answer any of the issues i raised 
We are not real happy customers yet Hope you can make us happy customerswhat can you do for us
My parents went on a trip in Brazil and booked it via lastminute I called several times in regards to issues with their accommodation and been promised call backs this never happened and my 60year old parents are stuck in a rut because none can be bothered to call back Shame on you you had no problem taking their money but now you cant be bothered to help them Disgusting

I realize your mission is a worthy one but my experience has been a substandard one My blanket is too small to qualify as a blanket perhaps a lap warmer and is very heavy so at night when I turn over the whole thing just ends up in a weighted ball somewhere in the bed Ive tried to wear it as a cape while watching TV Ive put it over and under my comforterbut nothing really works
The color was what I expected The bean bag stuffing was not Im also wondering why these little pockets with the beans arent fully filled with banting or cotton For 200 I was expecting something amazing The fabric was average the pockets with plastic beans was odd and it mostly feels like someone poked a hole in a potentially fluffy blanket and let all the air out
I read that returns are prohibited So I trusted the website the reviews and took the plunge I wont recommend this to anyone I know In fact I crochet blankets for loved ones with a high quality heavy weight yarnand these are much more evenkeeled balanced soft and quiet and stay on the covers through the night once you place them there

I am very dissatisfied with my shopping experience at miniinthebox I will never visit their page again I had to pay outlay fee and import VAT which costed as much as my order and I did not get informed about risk of paying it at all After I have contacted miniinthebox they told me that they cannot do anything for me because i did not pay for customs and tax insurance which they did not inform about earlier I think this is cheating and that is why I want to warn others from making this big mistake and order anything from miniinthebox
Ive never been dealt with such dreadful customer service in my life and this was not only on one occasion but on two  involving another flight ticket
I booked a flight for a weekend in Barcelona as I has an important event to attend to on Friday I had originally booked the flight to leave the UK at 630 am so i could get to Barcelona as early as possible A week after the booking was done i receive and email stating the reschedule of my flight they had changed the flight leaving on friday and 630am to leave on friday at 530pm this is an 11 HOUR DIFFERENCE WHICH AFFECTS ME I Called last minute and they where NO HELP AT ALL they kept saying they will put the request in to see what they can do i kept going round in circles and nothing was being resolved I eventually asked for refund and to this this day i am still being tossed around My flight is now this weekend and NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO HELP THIS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND AGENCY HAS DONE NOTHING BUT BROUGHT STRESS TO MY LIFE BECAUSE OF THIS I WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO ATTEND THE IMPORTANT EVENT I HAD PLANNED AND LOOSE ALL MY MONEY
ADVICE TO ALL  DONT BOOK THROUGH THIS COMPANY AS THEY DONT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
I Submitted a claim for Surface Pro 3 in June 2016 and heard back immediately The agent told me to pay for the shipping label and send the device which i did in a day
After that i never heard back from anyone until i posted a review online sometime in SeptemberOctober Esurranty replied to my review on TrustPilot and said they have no record of claim from this customer However someone called me the same day i posted the review and told me about the miscommunication that had happened between esurranty and Microsoft He told me he would have Microsoft repair the device and that the repaired device sent back to me in a week
But again never heard back from him I left a dozen voicemails and emails but no response I went ahead and posted a second review and essuranty replied back to the response  It is unfortunate that there is not a way for us to dispute false statements from customers The account notes show that your claim was denied because it was a preexisting issue according to the MicroSoft store when they diagnosed the device There is not any propertycasualty insurance or extended warranty company that covers preexisting damage or mechanical issues All approved claims are handled as quickly as possible and devices that are not repairable are replaced unless the claim is denied and then the device is returned to the customer
Its funny they claim that the claim was denied when the person who got in touch with me after my first reply told me the device was repaired and would be sent to me And even if they denied my claim  they never sent my device back to me
They are very good at replying back to reviews and making it look like the customers fault but they never reply back to your email and try to solve the issue This is the third time i am posting a review in the hope that someone would contact me and we can coordinate on how to get my device back from them My claim number is CL5152401
Not happy with purchase I bought code to put money on my psn account but will not work due to being in a different country I did not see written anywhere when buying code that it would only work in correct country
My books got returned to sender and now I dont have what I paid for

First impressions means a lot and my first experience with Oliver and Piper was not a good one From the package being sent to a totally different address and individual and then the post office from that location constantly contacting me as they were trying to get it delivered to me which I did appreciate Then I received an additional item as the company did send out another one to me and that I also appreciated as well but what I did not appreciate was when I notified them that I received the original item before I even got the one that was on its way the representative that has been emailing me regarding the issue told me to ship it via USPS indicating that I pay for the return shipping which I emailed her back and stated that I would not do such a thing as the entire debacle was no fault of mine and I requested that they provide me with a return shipping label The nerve of that was beyond me I would shop elsewhere where there are less hassles I even asked for a discount or promo code and she said no Glad the ordeal is almost over The item was not worth the headache at all
Trying to change a part of my booking Called them Was stuck over the phone for almost 30 minutes Then the line disconnected Apparently they are not allowed to call their customers But we have to call them and pay for the privilege of getting nothing done I will never book with them again and I will put it on my Facebook for all my friends Unacceptable service
The only problem is my machine sometimes refuses to take the compatibles Bought 2 2 yellow 564xl for my HP Deskjet 3070 A Machine would not accept them This has happened before  thats why I bought 2 of yellow that I was out of and of others that I might need shortly in the hope that if 1 didnt work the other would
Now I think I will have to switch to HP cartridges at much higher cost or buy a new machine Very frustrating
However would still like to buy through Inkjet as buying from them is so simple  a good price
I booked a flight a few months ago through travelup The airline stoped operations from the airport I was going to fly from a month later Travelup offered another flight from another aiport 2 hours away from the airport I was originally to fly or a refund
As flying from the new airport wasnt convenient I was offered a refund however not for the total amount Travelup deducted 100  despite they received a full refund from the airline Travelup said I had to pay some taxes original booking fee credit card charges ATOL protection fees Scheduled Airline Failure Insurance fees Saafi charges and ticket suppliers
They said the refund will be actioned 89 weeks after they received the refund from the airline wich was expected early December It is now nearly March and I havent received no refund Neither they are bothering replying my emails so I have decided to take the matter to the small claims court
My advice is to stay away from this company and their sister companies
LLEGARON LOS SOBRES EN UNA CAJA SIN PROTECCIN Y PRCTICAMENTE ROTA PARA LO QUE SE PAGA DE ENVO ES DECEPCIONANTE
Booked through webjet for 14000 and paid deposit and insurance through the webjet booking service
Redspot charged me 33100 at car pickup which included their own insurance 135 and who knows what other feescharges
The webjet booking service and redspot have not communicated the original booking Quote and purchase of insurance at time of booking
I paid a deposit online and no record of that via redspot invoice
Terrible customer service at pickup of car pushy rushed attendant not willing to answer basic questions leaving us with two options  not getting a car that we paid a deposit on or paying more than double what we were Quote d and paid the deposit for
Cannot believe how unsatisfactory this is Wish I could give it a zero rating Currently trying to get information through redspot customer service but not much luck there
Did not allow me to choose extra legroom I am a big man and will suffer terribly on a long flight London UK To Calgary Last time l did this in a 767 l almost had a break down My knees were jammed up against the back if the seat in front for 8 hours I am 230 lbs and over 6 feet Your web page shut down on me before l could make the sear selection

I reluctantly paid a deposit on a car rental at Chicago airport I was charged a high percentage of he deposit price in foreign payment bank charges At no time did I see any warning that this could be the case Very annoyed ad disappointed since I could have avoided the fee by using a different means of payment
Very poor customer service
Customer service has always been great here Keep your eyes open for the specials sometimes theyre too good to pass up
Its a great email platform but thats as far as it goes
Anything else such as if theres ever a problem and if you need help for some reason well then you might as well bend over and take it in the rear because they lie and dont help as their email 35 business days thing claims
I lost access to my gmail account no thanks to stupid gmail authenticator and couldnt get back into my account no matter what I tried so I emailed them about it because nothing else was letting me back in and it has now been almost a month and no reply
Because of this I am moving all my accounts to a new mailbox system and refuse to rely on crappy gmail no more
The visor came to me bent I called customer service did as they requested Took pictures and sent via email with order number Have never had a response Bad is too high a grade
Booked my honeymoon flights one evening the following morning they called me up and very rudely told me the booking had been cancelled  giving no further reasoning and have refunded my money which will take three working days meaning I cannot even book replacement flights Customer service is absolutely appauling the representative that rang me was beyond rude and couldnt hang up quick enough AVOID AT ALL COSTS
Drlig kundeservice  U serious firma Aldri igjen
dishonest scam artist
I keep coming back Think your doing good no complaints
I was Quote d one price and then refunded a completely different price When I asked why the prices were different I received no answer
Im not happy I have been on hold for now over 30 minutes waiting to clear this up I only want flight only and I selected no to cancelation and Manulife insurance And some how I was charged for both I am now in the line waiting for customer service to correct this huge mistake and honour what I originally selected to purchase
Used Service Stop for the first time yesterday having read all the positive reviews My car was collected early and I was told it would be back between 46pm A driver would bring it back once I paid the bill No problem
Invoice came through about 3pm and paid online immediately I then waited and waited 6pm came and went and no car I had to go out so thought they were running a little late so would drop it off and put the key through the door Arrived home at 11pm still no car
I called the garage first thing this morning to be told they hadnt received confirmation of payment from Service Stop and in fact they had 2 other cars still at the garage for the same reason They would not bring my car back until they had payment To say I was unhappy is an understatement Service Stop phone line doesnt open until 10am so I was stuck
Car eventually brought back midmorning with an apology from the driver Its not his fault but not having my car back the same day was simply not acceptable
Definitely wont be using again or recommending to others
The worst experience Ive had in a decade of online shopping After placing the order they have this weird verification process I received no notification that they hadnt been able to verify me through the voicemail that was left Though the payment sure went through  so the timeframe that I had required the card for had passed so the following morning I emailed them requesting them to cancel the order and refund me for the purchase 13 emails later having to do ridiculous verification processes later short and useless replies  they completely ignored me and proceeded with the purchase against my expressed wishes from the very start of my communication including the verification photo Would never recommend them Do yourself a favour and go to another site  particularly if you want it delivered in a timely fashion without having to jump through ridiculous hoops
Incorrect sizing of item on website the item had sizes listed as Womens for a womens item in the womens section When I received these they were clearly Mens sizes as the shoe was 2 sizes too big
I asked to return these with full refund including shipping as shipping to Australia is very expensive and this was a mistake on their part for providing incorrect information All they offered was a replacement and 5 store credit but returning the shoe would cost me more than the shoe itself

Things went well until I needed to edit and item in my cart There was no option to just edit so I had to delete and then it wouldnt bring what I wanted back up I had to then contact customer service which was a 40 minute ordeal and became quite a process It all worked out in the end I just hope I love the product when it comes in
Ordered a coat It arrived late it arrived missing key design aspects of the order the lapels were only half pressed the buttons were inaccessible the fabric was wrinkled and has a small tear A cheap coat from Primark would have been made better They forced me to pay for the return international shipping to their obviously nonexistent quality control department despite the issue being their fault I only paid to send it back out of my own pocket because their customer service promised to make a free remake and donate the faulty coat
Bear in mind I ordered the coat in December It is now early March 2 weeks after the new coat details were agreed yes agreed  accepted I got a message requesting further payment before they make the coat What the heck is this Tailor4Less are liars worst company I have ever dealt with Refused to give me a contact number refused to take responsibility refused to give me a refund and now that I have done my part they are going back on their word and bullying me to pay them more Good lord I have absolutely no confidence in their ability to create the coat as depicted on the sales website yet alone in their word
Utterly terrible stay a way it is just not worth the months of wasted time and horror
I ordered a black one piece swimsuit in a size small and it was in terrible shape The swimsuit was all stretched out as if someone had worn it a couple of times Size small seemed like a size medium but I couldnt confirm since all the tags and labels were ripped off literally ripped off There were laces on the side and the loops that held the laces were falling apart The breast cups that were inside the swim suit was bent My hands were also black from the ink coming off the DRY swimsuit The whole design of the swimsuit seemed as if someone had slapped everything together and sowed it by hand Never will buy from this company again So many regrets
But when the dates changed three weeks before my flight I found my change insurance was worthless and I ended up paying double the money for seats 24 hours prior to the ones I had booked Wednesday flight The booking was easy  I had no interaction except with the website But trying to make the change was a nightmare Six hours on the phone four separate salespeople none of whom spoke English or French for a first language Twice I was hung up on the first time after two hours on the phone and having given assent to the final change I would never book through Flight Hub again
RIGHT NOW A 2  ITS BEEN A REAL PAIN IN MY BUTT AS SOON AS MY REFUND AND DRESSES GET HERE THEN IT WILL GO UP
Had ordered Foodler from CPK at various locations through Foodler  always timely and warm Not today from PF Changs to my house maybe 10 minutes away More than 2 hrs and 3 phone calls later cold food Foodler called Dashed PF Changs blamed Dashed Ordered at 604 on a Thursday night  no snowstorm App said would arrive at 720 Emailed them at 734 they emailed back right away Called at 748 saying I would be reimbursed my 799 delivery fee I said gotta do better than that over 12 hr past time and said I could expect in ANOTHER 1520 minutes Called PF Changs manager who said they just picked up maybe 10 minutes before As I was on phone tracking started Finally got cold food at 806PM
For half a year I have tried to get Money back form FireFly because they charged us for 168 euro in additional Insurance although we already had paid for the Insurance to their partner DoYouSpain On the internet we hired and paid for the car hire and Insurance to DoYouSpain 3 month before
But at the front desk in Barcelona Airport where we should pick up the car from FireFly we couldnt get the car keys unless we paid extra We showed the staff our documentsin English from DoYouSpain saying that we didnt need the additional Insurance because we already were fully covered
And it is all about using the Danish Visadankort They dont accept it as a credit Card They tell us it is a debit Card
We have contacted DoYuoSpain and FireFly several times but none of them will give us our Money back car hire prepaid to DoYouSpain including Insurance for 12 days was 226 Euro
Ive been in contact with Forbruger Europa Denmark and told them about the method DoYouSpain and FireFly use to get extra Money
DONT use DoYouSpain and FireFly

Have only had one experience with Sortlist as an agency and it has been bad Their site has technical issues and the opportunity I was given was either bogus or poorly screened When I tried to voice my concerns to them they responded with a canned answer Terrible Ive also taken the time to check out their Facebook page and find it unethical that one of the founders of the company has given Sortlist a 5star review If youre a client I suppose youd have nothing to lose If youre an agency thinking of testing a new way to conduct business development stay away from Sortlist
When placing my order with two products that are supposedly in stock I was told that in 45 days I would arrive After 10 days I contacted them and they told me that one of the items is not available yet that I had them arrive from one of their physical stores and that 23 days later send me After 8 days I was sent an email indicating that the missing item was no longer available
It took them 3 weeks to tell me that they did not have the product they had insured Of course cancel the order and will not buy again in this store Everything very sloppy
Al hacer mi pedido incluyendo dos productos que estaban supuestamente en stock se me indic que en 45 dias me llegara Despues de 10 dias contact con ellos y me dijeron que uno de los items no estab disponible todavia que les tenia que llegar de una de sus tiendas fisicas y que 23 dias despus me lo enviaran Pasados 8 dias me mandaron un correo indicando que el item que faltaba ya no estaba disponible
Tardaron 3 semanas en decirme finalmente que no tenian el producto que me habian asegurado Por supuesto cancel el pedido y no volvere a comprar en esta tienda Todo muy cutre
dhabitude cela se passe bien
I had my flights jump in price on the day I wanted AS I WAS BOOKING IT Had to pay 70 more

Vision Direct said my product was on the way After a couple of weeks of waiting I was then told its not on its way and out of stock They now say it will take up to 9 days to get to the distribution centre and then God knows how long from there I could be waiting over a month just to receive my sunglasses Extremely poor service and wont be using them again
I have used Skype for years It was a wonderful service and solved so many problems for me What is there now is not Skype It does not deserve the name Its disappearing makes me sad It was a good thing
What is there now is some version of a non communication nightmare that has no real customer service but rather endless loops It is possible that you will be charged for something you do not want to be charged for It is unlikely you will be able to file the form to get it back You will want to close your account You will become bewildered about how to do so You will try and try to follow the loop to customer support be forced to join Microsoft something or other while so doing That will not help you You will be switched back and forth across web and nonweb Skype and into microsoft verification forms endlessly
I largely feel neutral about Bill Gates and how he has earned his fortune and then gives from it I did admire the giving piece This fake Skype changed that for me His affiliation with this product bewilders me It is truly terrible now and feels like it steals from people by how it charges and evades  recourse He would do well to discontinue his affiliation with it soon before it really damages his reputation
The space to store ashes is a jokeI bet it only held TBS of my mothers ashes The piece is unique but definitely not worth the money spent
I bought a backpack on a Sunday and paid for the priority shipping which states 13 days since I was going to fly out that week and wanted to use it that same week When it finally shipped I called FedEx to get an estimated time of arrival and they told me that the package was sent through regular service not expedited and that I would not get it on time I emailed Tomtop one week later and still no response I tried the chat many times and it failed to work until today when I finally could get in contact with them They were of no help simply saying that the fact they shipped it with FedEx and not USPS justified the extra charge and made it priority Then in the middle of the chat they just stopped answering I truly doubt it had anything to do with the connection they simply chose to ignore me Customer service after a purchase is nonexistent with this site
I regret to have contacted this site claims are not accepted ignored any requestbut to write about them well into the money offered regularly
Very difficult to communication with 25 plus I was rang back on a private number Very difficult to deal with  luckily I never had to make a claim I had both my car and home insurance

Went in for my sixth laser treatment for hair removal My worst visit so far My appointment was at noon and I wasnt seen till 1215 no big deal I have two hours allocated for my treatment Usually doing my underarms lower face full legs and full arms takes an hour and a half The lady did it all in 40 minutes skipping my underarms When I told her she skipped my underarms she said no I did them u just didnt notice I wont notice laser treatment on my underarms I dont think she knows how much money I paid for this package  she was really unprofessional checking her phone texting and not doing her job as supposed to Very disappointing since I took two hours out of my day just for this appointment and I drove 40 minutes to get to that location one treatment session is wasted
There was only two choices in the size of tires I neede I felt the price was fair but the shipping experience was where my disappointment came in I put a note on my door requesting any shipping needing a signature be delivered at my neighbor house because I work during the day and he is home all day The FedEx driver didnt my neighbor was waiting all day for a knock at the door that never happened I had to wait another day for the tires
I understand Sydney is a diverse location but if you deal with customers a clear and well articulated communication should be peramount I understand redspot is not a big company but that means they need to be therefore a bit better then those
I am sorry to say that the color cartridges did not work for me and I had to dispose them without any use at all They did not snap into my printer head properly and in fact one of them broke I wrote to Inkfarm and told them about it but they did not respond at all So I wasted my money

We did not end up using Zicasso to book our trip to Japan or Southeast Asia Their website pretends to appeal to all price levels when in fact only the highest prices are available Whatever prices are initially put down Zicasso tells you it will be much higher Question why bother putting costs down that are unavailable In the end you are much better off going to the travel agent of your choice or book directly You will save lots of money
While the agents at Zicasso are friendly enough and respond relatively quickly the general nature of the responses are about the costs you are willing to absorb for your trip And as noted there does not seem to be any interest in getting quality accommodations at the best price possible rather it appears to be about maximizing the travel costs

I placed two separate dress orders The delivery was on point But the quality of the dresses are very poor I was in question about one of the dresses as far as the Color Its description was Nude When I called promgirl I wanted to be sure that the Color was as they stated She said as far she could see it was nude Not the case when the dress arrived it is a bright peach Color I paid extra shipping of 17 to get the dress fast only to be disappointed  I emailed PromGirl to see if they can refund me in full for this particular dress because I called to have specified on the Color before I placed the order I especially would of like a refund for the extra cost in shipping But the failed to email be back So I was stuck with the restocking fee along with the extra shipping cost

This company is not following any company policy they are forcing for overtime everyday but not giving any overtime and not even compensation when i raised my voice then they separated me due to my to my sick leave which was approved by them because i was having sufficient leave in my leave kitty After that also they kept my fnf and salary They are not following any policy and HR also talking in layman language they newer listen any thing from employees And this is not first case this company did this with many many people There is lots of thing about this company to say but due to some principles of mine I will not say any more beyond this
I changed from Bord Gais after hearing that Energia were supposedly better value However since changing my bills for gas have been terrible I have even been charged twice for a bill I paid The costs of an estimated bill is a joke
My new bike is great However getting it delivered was a nightmare I sent it to a post office as I was unable to send it to my residence It turns out the delivery company Reid Cycles uses cant deliver to post offices which isnt stated anywhere on their website So the bike wasnt delivered and was just sitting in a random warehouse I
called Reid a week after it was supposed to be delivered to ask what why it hadnt been delivered Customer service was useless They told me they would call me back if there was a problem I didnt hear from them I waited another week before calling the delivery company who informed me why they couldnt deliver it and that it was just sitting in a warehouse Noone contacted me to tell me this Presumably if I hadnt followed up It wouldve sat there indefinitely I then had to take time off work to pick it up from the warehouse as it was only open during business hours
Sales representative gave me wrong information MisQuote d the installation price Said it was 95 but ended up at 150 Also told me that my brother or father could take the car in for me to the installation site and it would be fine It was not fine I had to be present the whole time And worst of all They misspelled my name on the dmv paper The installer said DMV would never take it because of one misplaced letter in my name I sent them my ID  unacceptable
Terrible customer service that reminds me to an extra low cost airline Avoid them at any cost
Giving it a 1 because theres no option for a 0 They dont call they dont even put notes on the lobby door Once they didnt deliver and didnt even notify us for the next 2 weeks Phone customer service is totally unhelpful The lady on the phone didnt know if undelivered goods would be available for pick up the same evening or the next day Instead she offered me to lodge a complaint against the driver which I thought was weird She said drivers are supposed to leave stickers specifying details So I asked if they have a designated driver for a particular location or more than one driver and she didnt even know that What an absurd way to pass the buck and just blame the driver
I just hope Amazon doesnt use their carrier services They just screw up amazon prime big time

Excellent bike Paid for bike and returned 7 days later to pick it up It hadnt been unpacked and had to wait over an hour before I could take delivery Didnt even come with a bell which I thought would be mandatory Phone calls and emails to the store an head office seem to have fallen on deaf ears Have not had one reply As I said excellent bike but non existent sales and after sales service
Bought a pair of skis online only to be told a week later that there was a mistake  they didnt have the skis as they had been sold to someone else Very poor
I thought itd be good to rent from a local company Wouldnt do it again I declined on additional insurance as I have forever Someone scraped the back bumper of the rental car while it was parked within 2 hours of me renting it They were deep enough scrapes in the fiberglass bumper on one corner that they were noticeable I took it to a local body shop that had great yelp reviews before I brought it back to them They hemmed and hawed had me turn the car in so they could evaluate it I had to make followup calls to keep things moving Then they came back 900 over what the body shop had estimated I gave both Quote s to my insurance company They then gave my insurance company all sorts of trouble and stretched the whole thing out for months Bottomline they are disorganized as a company and they arent ethical in their dealings They tried to make a lot of money off of me and my insurance company I would not rent from them ever again
I have a previous review up for this same purchase however the issue has become substantially worse and they continue to offer horrific service I purchased two Seagate Ironwolf ST8000VN0022 35in 8TB NAS HDDs two weeks ago along with a QNAP TS453A4G 4 Bay NAS upon receiving these after setting it up I noticed a huge amount of noise coming from the drives Upon pulling them out I checked the serial number which ended in N002 rather than N0022 meaning they sold me a prior model of this drive NOT ADVERTISED AT ALL ON THEIR WEBSITE that had been discontinued
This was the original issue however now it turns out the QNAP is dysfunctional and has to be sent back too QNAP have confirmed the issue and have offered a replacement but it has to be returned through PCCG however the disgusting reprehensible service people here say it will take 24 weeks to replace it saying they have to confirm this with QNAP despite QNAP saying this is not necessary and it has already been confirmed They tried to deceive me by giving me 6 month old hard drives which were the wrong model and which I wouldnt have noticed if not for the noise they made and now they refuse to replace a 700 QNAP in a timely manner I work for myself and this has cost me over 10 hours of hassle dealing with the disgusting people at PCCG and setting up a system where the drives are 6 month old and discontinued only to find this out later on and now the QNAP isnt functional
Ill go to the ACCC over this because its absolutely disgusting and Im almost sure they are trying to punish me for my previous negative review which they harassed me on the phone over Im also going to complain on their Google Trusted store accreditation They tried to deceive me by selling me a product that had been discontinued for 6 months and was not what I paid for and now they refuse to replace a faulty QNAP
I can barely believe how horrific the service is they obviously took to heart what I said about never coming back in my prior review and how I mentioned I would tell everyone I know about how disgusting they are now it seems they are punishing me for it despite their own deception and incompetence Worst experience I have ever had with ANY store
Descent products highly priced but with good sales that make them ok but terrible with delivery time and customer service they take for ever to get back to you and to process things
I had to provide way to much information to dlgamer in the name of security to get my game Lame
I have requested Lenskart to measure my eyesight and make lens and frame for me
I had purchased the spectacles of Vincet from Lenskart for Rs12000
I got the delivery of the specs in October 2016 after opening and wearing it I noticed that the lens did not suit my eye sight resulting in blur eyesight
I returned this after of couple of days and requested to kindly review the product but after 15 days the same specs were delivered to me Again some personnel along with some senior official once visited my place for inspection of my eyesight from Lenskart again the wrong eyesight measurements were taken and this time the specs were delivered to me after 20 days in February 2017
I have just wasted my money by trusting Lenskart resulting in loss of Rs12000
Its really disappointing that I am just following up for lens since i have purchased it but did not receive proper service or specs as per my specifications which should suite my eye sight
Was trying to book Valentines flowers online but the website was broken it kept asking me for tags and didnt accept the order Later the order by phone went fine although the lady could have been a bit friendlier 
Dear fellow customers this has been a terrible ecommerce experience I ordered a 100 voucher from Fishpond on 14032017 on 17032017 it was confirmed by their courier company that this parcel is missing After 6 emails to Fishpond who dont have a phone number customers can contact and 5 phone calls to the courier company this is how I have been treated  each time a DIFFERENT Fishpond personnel replies and I have to regurgitate my situation they have not apologised or shown the slightest will to help solve the scenario even after I email them with the helpful courier companys email confirming 1 parcel is missing 2 only Fishpond can resolve with courier as only Sender has contracting relationship with courier  Fish pond STILL responds telling me to contact courier company and sort this out MYSELF
At this moment in time  23032017  I have had no refund no reissued voucher come my way no resolution  only a very sincerely helpful and willingtoadmitmistake courier company
A deeply disappointed customer  I would give 0 or negative stars if I could

They keep renewing your hosting even though you initially pay in advance If it runs out after 12 months the account should turn off well not here there will keep invoicing you adding changes for a service you dont even need This is illegal sending letters and treating further cost is a joke
I made a reservation it showed that I was supposed to pay 50 dollars for a one day rental

I called 2x before placing order to confirm shipping date Item showed up 1 month earlier then dates I was given in the fall company took no ownership No communication from Willis when item shipped email came from Fed Ex and went to spam Called to inquire about early shipment  First representative I spoke with was rude and kept interrupting me she finally transferred me when I asked her not to interrupt me Communication improved with the next representative Still no ownership over my original shipping date information They had no interest in my feedback when I told them an email from Willis regarding shipping would benefit the customer
Well to be completely honest weve been disappointed a majority of the trip The weather has really affected the trip We were able to do the boat ride but it was rainy cold and you couldnt see anything because of the fog We learned that we shouldnt book excursions ahead of time as every trip we took was affected The ferry to rangitoto island had little visibility and then when we got to the island there was nothing to see and the tour was not good A similar story for Waiheke island Everyone kept saying how there werent many people for the excursions because people dont choose to go when the weather is bad It made us feel pretty bad
Then in Queenstown they couldnt believe we wanted to go up the gondola ride because you couldnt see anything but thats when it was booked for and it was pre booked
Again weather is no ones fault but we will never again prebook so many weather dependent activities I would recommend you inform future NZ travelers that those activities your company books are largely weather dependent and not enjoyable in rainy low cloud weather And they should wait to book activities until they arrive
Transfers were fine Hotel in Auckland was an awkward apartment Hotel in Queenstown was nicer
Also the morning we went to check in for the ferry for Rangitoto island at the time on our sheet we were informed it had been cancelled and moved by four hours No one called or emailed to inform us of this Pretty terrible service when we had arranged the day around this
Dont try
This is an honest review
I booked an expensive international flight However in 24 hours I havent received a confirmation email I called them to ask what was going on They told me that the fare was changed I had to cancel my booking There is still a pending charge on my credit card account so that I cannot make another flight ticket purchase
So dont try your chance Waste of time

PayPal Case PPD838269
Better Business Bureau Case 540001
I purchased an iPad Mini from one of PayPals Merchant  Vendors Gazelle on January 16 2017 Upon receiving the iPad Mini I discovered it would not meet my professional needs The iPad Mini was returned and received by Gazelle on January 27 2017 Gazelle has a 30day no questions ask returnrefund policy To date Gazelle has refused to refund my 40303 I spoke with a Gazelle Supervisor Brianna on 01302017 she told me they attempted to refund my 40303 to PayPal but the refund was rejected According to PayPal Gazelle was 100 dishonest about attempting to process my refund
I have spoken with five PayPal agents who have failed to provide process the charge back credit or refund to my account The agents I spoke with are PayPal agents Jeannette CSR Matthew Supervisor Aaron Supervisor Charnetta CSR and Disputes Representative Colleen neither one of them could say for sure when or if my 40303 would be refunded or charged back as a credit to my account I will say that Charnetta showed empathy and concern The rest of the PayPal agents could care less
I returned the product within 9 days of receiving it within the same condition it was shipped to me in PayPal was provided with the USPS Tracking 9201990113668003715528 for the return They have refused to verify the tracking
They are allowing this vendor to wrongfully keep 40303 for merchandise that returned a month ago My refund should have been credited back to my account almost immediately This is another one of those BIG businessestoo BIG to care about its consumers Shame on them for not treating their customers like they would want to be treated under the same circumstance
Instead PayPal supports the willful intentional and malicious financial injury of allowing consumer accounts to reflect balances they really do not owe I returned the product within 9 days of receiving it in the same condition it was shipped to me in My refund should have been credited back to my account almost immediately
I am demanding that the 40303 is credited back to my account with no more delays and excuses I need in writing from PayPal a definitive date of when they will be applying the charge back credit or refund of 40303 to my account
What I said above Very disappointed in them and not worth the trouble to go through the hassle to get refunds returns exchanges for me I just chalk it up to something I will not do again
They were once the best Items no longer get shipped No notifications of nonshipments No longer emails on deliveries No longer quick shipping The last straw was a non shipment for not having item in stock which was shown in stock Buy elsewhere
And please note the PureFormulas posted a response and said they would be looking into the situation and contacting me They never contacted me Shop elsewhere
I am so disappointed that my above order did not show up for my sisters birthday My account has been deducted I have searched for a number for teleflorist Ireland but nothing shows up If I hear nothing I will be forced to take action
I am always careful when purchasing DVDs online to check that they are compatible with Australia Region 4 so I was happy when I found a Miranda Complete Collection advertised on Fishpond and the description stated that it was Region 4 However when I opened the parcel I discovered that the DVD was Region 2 I contacted Fishpond and was provided with a link to look up DVD hacks to unlock my DVD player but if this didnt work I could send the DVD back for a refund of the item only and not postage costs
Very disappointed as this was supposed to be a gift
Whats the point of having the discount codes displayed if they shipping code cannot be used resulted in me placing several items back
My customer service experience a few days ago was horrific I purchased a groupon for a stay at a hotel with spa sevices once I made my purchase I booked upon calling to set up spa services I was informed they have to be done well in advance I didnt have later date that would work for my stay Groupon denied my refund because they are not responsible for cancelled reservations However I was not afforded access to the services they advertised
Rahul was pleasant enough but I did not appreciate the price increased while I was making the reservation via phone Normally I would prefer to use the computer but there was not an edit button on the website I accidentally clicked past add baggage and could not go back to edit it As a result I paid almost 50 extra with live person fee and the price increase
Again Rahul was very pleasant and effective He was not the cause He did the best he could
Ordered tshirt on Monday and phoned to confirm Due to delays they upgraded my order to express delivery so it was supposed to arrive on Thursday No sign on Thursday so called them to check dispatch  no answer Called Friday Saturday and Sunday with still nobody picking up the phone which just rang out with no voicemail Needed to tshirt for a corporate event on Tuesday and Wednesday Finally got in contact to discover the person who had dealt with my order had left the company and moved to SpainTshirt supposedly delivered on a pre 9am delivery for Tuesday morning didnt arrive until midday Wednesday Although a refund was issued it didnt detract from the dreadful experience Certainly wont be using them again
I hired a BMW or alike  the car rental company only had a Skoda telling me that was alike I did not take that bad car Carrentals does not refund and charges the full rental period

I had a good experience with my salesperson but a horrible experience after that One of my pieces of furniture was badly damaged in a spot that was very visible to the drivers who were screwing on the legs when it arrived but they chose to not tell me about the damage and I did not see it until after they left Several of the throw pillows were also damaged I then went back to the store to return the furniture They were very apologetic and agreed to a full refund and that I would get a zero balance statement because I had financed but that I did not need anything in writing I considered the issue closed When I got the credit card bill today however it included a 9998 balance for shipping This was very disappointing as I was told that I was being given a full refund I paid the bill so I can close out the GardnerWhite credit card and consider this awful experience complete When your customer service team agreed to a refund I said that I would give GardnerWhite another chance in the future I dont believe that will be the case anymore
they are unareasonnable they cant even facilitate their customers last time i will ever buy tickets from them

Opened up my computer  appeared that I was due for an update of my drivers etc As a Microsoft partner and with things changing but no info about or before downloads happen  I mistakenly assumed that this was a Microsoft change to downloading updates Even though I felt funny about it
There were 4 downloads to take care of my 16 new or too old drivers  garbage garbage Low and behold after wasting my time  I learn that they want different amounts of money for the service I immediately backed out  found that they had installed the files I was able to uninstall 2 of them but the last two titled with Tweakbit have not been uninstalled From the beginning of the uninstall process repeatedly Please wait until the current program is finished uninstalling or being changed appeared  it has now been over 24 hours and it is still appearing and the files are still in the same location
I did not feel my computer needed to be faster  it was fine Now I am running into problems with downloading files and working with Acrobat DC after never having any difficulties before
This was a misrepresentation as if it was supported by Microsoft no costs were mentioned until the end
the sales person gave me a different price to add internet than the 1499 I see now The sales person told me a price over 3000 Or I would had gotten the internet
Most companies reward customers for their loyalty but not this one For as long as Ive used the service they never offer any kind of promotions but they constantly ask for feedback and reviews and nothing changes
Really poor service not acpect from u guys using ifrom am using your service last 1 year not good excuse from you you  once i got my money back then delete my account
Very professionals
Dont trust this site i paid for a key and they did not deliver and they are not responding to any of my messages nor the Live support 
This site is only fraud and scamming
Trust me DO NOT TRUST 
Waited over an hour for meal and they went to the wrong address They called me and asked me to come out saying your meal is here come out the front They were at the wrong address They didnt read the instructions I put there Never using this company again No help whatsoever
I have rented from Malagacars for the last 7 or so years on approximately 14 occasions In effect you achieve 1 loyalty bonus discount on each occasion you use the Company eg 13 bookings equals 13 discount Up until last year you were able to use this in conjunction with Promo codes available to anyone eg Use HELLOFAN in the promo code box and you will receive 10 discount no whoever they have stopped the ability to use both discounts which effectively means that for 10 bookings Mallagacar treats you no better and indeed less well than someone who uses them for the first time and happens to use the HELLOFAN promo code This combined with their changes in insurance and breakdown cover which forces you to take the full pack rate unless you want to be hit with potential huge costs through a breakdown in the car means that prices have escalated substantially in the last 2 years Explanations welcome because I know I am not the only fan of Malagacar considering going elsewhere because of these changes
In the case that everything works fine of course customers are satisfied but what happens if UPS has to much to do and you just booked the standard delivery Well it is really easy you dont receive the product but you are the responsable person who needs to pay afterwards the duty
Y estn diciendo que la entrega y la devolucin est gratis Mentira vas a pagar las tasas
Further more they expect you to be home all day And even if you talked to the customer service to reschedule for another day and you going to tell that you just home at the evening they dont care they will come the same day during the morning So why do we have actually customer service if UPS afterwards does what it wants doesnt matter because if everything goes wrong dont worry you are going to pay and dont worry the payment you need to make wont be cheap And regarding them they did fullfill their duty and tryed to deliver three times so easy In my case I bought two carpets I called various times before to UPS and paid allready like 20 bugs for being just in line and just to lisen to cheap excuses Delivery day was the 4th of january but I dindt received the goods and I dindt received also a call neither did I received a note in my mail box But dont worry if UPS fails you going to pay afterwards 44 because it is your fault that you cant be at home all day long 3 days in a row and your are working
So better make sure that you have in busy times 3 days free because if UPS cant make it you going to pay a lot for nothing
I ordered 50 post cards as a test lot I was planning to buy another 5000 or so for promotional reasons
The cards arrived damaged  in the post Corners totally bent kinks in the prints etc
On closer inspection almost all of the images had some sort of bubbling in the emulsion  coating of the paper They were totally unacceptable to send out to clients  absolutely no quality control what so ever
Worth avoiding if youre in the image making industry
Chinese vendors on DHgate do tricks with shipping and not keep their promises I dont feel that DHgate does much to protect the buyer The support slow and not cooperative
I paid for this service Yes I got a great design the design team was quick and pretty much got what I wanted My logos and other items were finished in a timely manner If you need help or have questions the chat people suck cant spell and are jerks I had one person named Morgan If you get her you can expect complete rudeness and illiteracy from her I have sent several questions and received no response They made it seem like it was easy for people who arent as computer literate as others and it isnt The designs arent as easy as entering your info into the business card and boom your done You cant change or move icons and I was told well it is easy Nice customer service Anyway if you are an expert you will probably be fine with this company if not I wouldnt suggest them
For the price its not bad My actual locker was clean I havent seen any mouse droppings The staff was very nice but almost seemed like they were reading off of a script
But Its very dingy in the building The carpets do not look very clean which is somewhat understanding with the amount of people in and out of the building all day
I get nervous riding the elevator to the third floor There is a stickersign on the elevator stating on 12202016 the elevator was deemed safe to use but did not pass inspection the notice also states another inspection is due in one month On 2252017 the same notice was still posted When the button to call the elevator is pushed on the third floor I noticed the lights dim like its using to much power The elevator doors open very slowly which is also a bit concerning especially when knowing the elevator did not pass inspection
I will continue to rent at StorageMart but more because of the convenience than anything else Its on my way to the place I will be staying it and is only a few minutes away
Good customer service over the phone but Im honestly bummed about the product My boyfriend sent me a pic of his cookie bouquet and it just didnt feel like what I ordered
Alqays great wfficient  peompt service In many years gave NEVER had any problems
I was suppose to receive my kitchen table with 6 chairs and had to send back due to chip marks and cracks This was on a Monday I told them to come back on Wednesday due to my work schedule and they showed up Tuesday Luckily I was home They were suppose to have the furniture already inspected and the furniture was still damaged The only thing That was not damaged was the top of the table I have to wait for them to come back for a third time to drop off furniture My fingers are crossed that they will actually inspect it so that I do not have to send back once again I paid for brand new so I want it to look brand new
Worst experience Ordered on the 6th When I track my order it says that the expected delivery was on the 13th Its already the 15th and the tracking page has not been updated Still havent received my package Very disappointed
Worst staff in dollar car rental in Dulles airport location unfriendly staff and very rude I would never go to this location again
It took two weeks for my order to be processed and delivered
When I go the shipment several of the cases were cracked The CDs were in good shape
uneccessary time consuming jibber jabber
Do not use avoid at all costs Deposited money to account placed a bet My bet won when I went to withdraw paddy power blocked my account
I cannot get my winnings or even money on the account back
Customer service are not helpful and extremely rude if you ask too many questions
AVOID PADDYPOWER IT IS A SCAM
Highly disappointed Wrongly filled up papers caused late arival of my delivery although i was paying extra money and i had to pay 20 pounds more for a tax which was not mentioned on website when i was making a purchase
see title too many leaked
I have to call 3 times before establishing a good connection Still looking for a good international phone company I use to speak 100 minutes per day but this calling card is driving me crazy Every time I am calling I have to do it 3 times Going back to the old one this month even if is more expensive
Didnt notify meand then still charged me for expedited shipping although I got the flag a week late
I like the music folder Its light weight has rings for holepunched music and elastic bands for folded page music It has nice little straps that prevent the folder from opening to wide with buttons for two width settings So its a good design
But it broke the first time I used it Not anything really critical It was the grommet on the strap that holds the folder open I guess it just didnt have enough solder on it or something Now unfortunately half of the grommet fell into some sort of rip in the spacetime continuum so I couldnt bring it home to repair with my own solder gun
Do I need that strap Probably not But every time I use the folder I cant help but think that its not quite as good as it should be

Booking made through corporate travel agency
Had to wait more than 15 mins for pick up while listening to the person in front of me complain about there booking Then had to supply a 200 holding bond on my credit card which would only be released up to 28 days later though you would have the car back the same day Then had to wait over 10 mins when dropping off the car
Then when emailed customer service to lodge complaint about the holding bond was told its not them but the banks fault Sorry what a lie The bank did not impose the bond you did
Would never recommend your service and only use it because the company I work for booked it
You gave me a room in a hotel other than I wanted I did not see anything that gave me an adequate heads up that this was happening
They do not deal with customers in any level One of the wheel came of during using because the metal piece they provided was not strong enough I asked for replacing the piece never get one Now the biggest problem is that the plastic is not strong enough in the back wheels and when I use the break they break out now not many left so the break not working properly This stroller is not safe for any children and should not be sold 
I had 3 couk domain that were setup for renewal on the 11032017
On the 27th of Feb 2017 2 weeks before renewal date Go Daddy charged my card well before the renewal date An obvious mistake
I spoke 3 times to Go Daddy and their terrible customer service They are not acknowledging their mistake and will NOT refund They say they can not refund because couk are not refundable Whatever that means They are expecting me to pay for their mistake Unbelievable
I had to call my bank to open a dispute case and go from there
Beware
if you want really bad merchandise no customer service have your credit card scammed  then alibaba and aliexpress are just for you it is the joke of the century i just had to cxl a credit card for 6 fake alibaba entries
I recently bought a pair of timberland mens 6 inch boots and although I had a speedy deliveryThe boots them selves were disappointing both had scuff marks on the leather and the left boot had large creases as though previously warn
When I contacted myshu all they could offer was 10 pounds compensation or send boots back for refund  Alot of time and hassle which I couldnt do as was going away and was relying on boots to go away with
I will not use Myshu again as can not trust quality of products
Would like to add that Emma at customer service with myshu was excellent
We will see how it works out Installer says push start vehicles like mine arent as compatible with your product
People count on your word and make choices based upon it I rented a truck and made plans based on the fees you Quote d me When I got to the storage facility I was told that there were no vacant units contrary to what I was told by sparefoot The storage facility employee was friendly enough but he told me that the fees you Quote d were not enough to cover the move in I was told there would be a 15 admin fee but it was 20 I was also told I would pay a prorated rate for this month The total was to be 60 It cost me 120 to move in Im sure thats not a big deal to you but that was my grocery money and Im going to be pretty hungry by Friday I wish you would be 3 your facts before just throwing them out there and taking peoples money I was committed with a rental truck and could not change or decline the unit due to time constraints
I told the woman at the desk that I had purchased an excess protection policy online Although I had ordered a VW Golf I was then told the only available car was a Honda Jazz The lady said that it was to dark for us to inspect the car but to look at it in daylight and if I found any damage to ring up  I rang to say that there were lots of marks including a deep graze on the drivers side I was told that my call had been logged
Surprise surprise when I returned the car after 6 days and only 142 miles there was no record of my call and I was charged 995 for the damage
When I protested the manager said to me  It wont cost you anything You just claim it back on the policy you bought
I wish I had read the reviews before using Green Motion as it seems they are not only rated the worst rental company of all but are well known for their sharp practices which are at best a scam and at worst insurance fraud
Returned 3prs of shoes fit problem and that was before Christmas 2016 still to this date waiting for the refund They claim they have not received them Than after further delay because they dont rush themselves they claim they did not send a returns note strange that because it was mounted on the parcel so not only out of pocket for over 7500 for shoes also out of pocket for the cost of returning them to Poland They then wanted proof of posting this was scanned and sent as requested still waiting for the refund and in fact a reply Very Very poor customer service poor contact no real effort to solve the problem get the impression if they take their time replying and sorting the problem youll go away AVOID THIS COMPANY  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
Read the reviews this does not appear to be unusual May be forced to take this further

I honestly think my expectations were too high for this product Unfortunately I didnt get much relief from oil 
I purchased a product from Tomtop in December 20 2016
It never arrived as of 17th March 2017
Contacted customer support many times via email without any reply from them
I used their online chat service to contact them but as soon as I told them my problem they terminated the chat
If you buy from them you are most likely to lose your money
They have contacted me and offered to pay me money to leave good reviews on here I am sure this is so they can take more innocent peoples money
I wholly recommend you do not buy anything from them
Ever since installing this device into my vehicle my experience has been absolutely positively and clearly about nothing but  It feels like their employees can care less about helping customers and they seem to have the mindset that regardless of the situation the customer is wrong Also dont dare ask to speak to a manager bc all you will get is an employee who poses as being someone of authority but is actually extremely uneducated unprofessional and rude I wish I could say something more positive but unfortunately I have no positive experiences with this company Hoping someone who represents this company and cares about the customers point of view sees this and contacts me because calling them for help is a waste of time
incomplete hardware disappointing Velcro not sewn in easily misinterpreted installation instructions no followup with customer service product does seem to perform as advertised but overall not worth it
System said you had stock I ordered I was then called to say you were short of stock I asked for part ship and I had an acknowledgement of this It did not ship I contacted again and it then shipped
got booked into an absolutely appalling location
Second time a location was double booked Got given a poor substitute instead
Still have not received
I ordered a fuel pump 4 days ago and when it came it was missing the wire harness connector now and Im getting the runaround I asked to speak with management after looking up their phone number because they do not respond to emails and they hung up on me not a good place to do business broke customer service reps disrespecting you they will never get another dollar from me
I purchased 10 Lombardy Poplar trees in midNovember 2016 hoping to get them planted before the ground froze up for the winter After three days with nothing but a receipt I emailed to ask when they would be shipped as each day was getting colder They told me midDecember at the earliest which was cutting it pretty close for me here on the North Shore of Massachusetts The trees did not ship One day in early March I received a notice from FedEx that a package from Willis Orchards will be delivered in a few days They did not reach out before hand to ask whether it made sense to send 10 trees to the frozen tundra that is Massachusetts in early March So I had 10 trees arrive Luckily the snow from the previous storm had melted and the ground softened up just enough for me to get them planted just before Superstorm Stella dumped another foot of snow on us I have no idea whether the trees will survive I can barely see them under the snow piles at the moment
I never really write reviews unless something is really good or really bad This store is the worst I ordered stuff December 12 th My order was shipped the 25th Out of 15 items received 5 the rest was back ordered never got any message about back ordered items Contacted customer service on the phone  nobody ever answers it  you wait for 30 min on hold then they hang up so i wrote an email They apologized for not contacting me and let me know that items that i ordered were discontinued by manufacturer And they will refund my money but refund reqest takes up to 30 business days and refund itself may take up to 10 days Do you believe how ridiculous that is Wait for my money back 40 business for items that i never received That is my second purchase with them first time they send me shoes with broken strap never responded tomy emailsNever will shop there again
As you asked my order number is 101977633
You are damn right i opened case with paypal I want my money back soon will be 4 months since my purchase how long it takes you to refund money for items i never received You are fraud and its a shame Unbelievable I will never shop there again and i will spend my time to write horrible reviews on every possible website to warn other people from making mistake i made
On top of all that i forgot to add that items you sent me werent new definitely was worn by someone else and panties area was dirty Disgusting
For the first time I receive a 10S voucher I buy and not only do not send the product but my voucher is reduced to 2 S
My request for delivery to my PO Box was rejected in favor of some obscure courier service you prefer All Ive received so far is a note from the courier to say that nobody was home at the time and i can arrange to collect myself from some outpost in Brisbane more that 100 ks away Ive spent 500 on goods that i may never receive It may be easier to just start again with a reputable company that can deliver to my needs and pursue 4 Cabling for a refund fat chance Im sick of suppliers that cant deliver to my needs and will never use this supplier in the future
My order was taking too long to arrive 10 days already so Ive contacted the company The contact said the package was lost but there would be a new delivery Two days after and still no news from my order I had to contact you again when I immediately received the confirmation that my order could be picked up at the store So hadnt I contacted you twice would my order never arrive
I placed an online order for a part on Sunday afternoon  February 26th In that order I paid for rapid shipping Following up on the transit progress via Eeurparts online system the system indicated that my order was shipped on Monday February 27th I telephonically contacted Eeuroparts customer service on Tuesday evening February 28th inquiring as the the whereabouts of my order The Customer Service representative indicated that the shipping company handling my order was changed from FedEx to USPS and that no further info was available She indicated that she would research and advise me within the hour The Eeuroparts representative did not return my call so I called again to understand if my order would be filledsent  she could not provide any additional information Its now Wednesday afternoon March 1st Telephoned Eeuroparts and spoke again to customer representative He indicated that he would have the premium shipping costs refunded to me but again could not provide more specific information as to why my order sitting at a distribution point approximately 23 miles away at 9 AM this morning is nothas not been delivered  and that no additional tracking update is available As I am a long time  customer repeat buyer with this company I would have expected at the very least that this organization would attempt to rectify their short comings  perhaps in the form of a a discount voucher good toward a future order Well its Wednesday nite as I complete this survey  and still this order has not been received keeping my fingers crossed to receive this order on Thursday To the new owners of Eeuroparts with customer service and followup like this I sincerely wonder how long you will remain in business I wish you success in resolution of these shortfalls to make my future business experiences with your company more pleasurable

I went to mavis to do my oil change we were outside waiting on the cold weather they did not open at their said time which is 8amcouple minutes later my car was pulled in for service I was told my passenger brake light was off if I want them to change the bulb it would be additional 10 dollars I told the front desk guy that I have an extra bulb in my car if they could put it in he yell no at me in front of all the other customers I felt so embarrassed even though one of the tech was still working on my car he refused Ive been doing business with sts for the past 15 years and the former workers NEVER treated me like thatI would never do business with this new company mavis
I received a phone call from ecareers about a PhotoshopGraphic Design course reduced from apparently 700 to 305 I enquired about I realised that the course itself wasnt exactly advanced but I was under the impression the course included all 3 ACA Adobe Certified exams included in the price I asked 3 times during the phone call to confirm that this course included both Adobe Photoshop Illustrator and InDesign I was told after asking three times that yes these were all included So I paid the 305
Turns out none of the exams were included in the deal you have to individually pay for them yourself so I cancelled the course within an hour of paying And Instead of receiving a refund within 35 working days I had to wait for weeks send multiple emails and file a dispute with my bank Eventually I got my money back Avoid like the plague They wasted a month of my time for no reason Absolute bunch of jokers Sales people and bad ones at that Good luck if something goes wrong with your course If it does you will NOT be able to contact them
Not too impressed as I returned goods 2 weeks ago and money has not been refunded as yet
Bad experience Ive write to customer services ans they didnt do nothing at all It was an error of the website for the dates of the reservation Ill never use this website again
Two weeks to receive parcel label Not received cheque yet must be nearly five weeks now
The Quote for the rental was 189 with taxes and fees Upon arrival I was informed of a mandatory supplemental Liability insurance fee of 1999 per day There was not mention of this required insurance fee in the Quote  There were several other charges also not mentioned in the Quote  I ended up paying almost 100 over the Quote d amount
I would never do business with this company again and I recommend that you avoid them as well
89 tickets cost me over 200 They never mailed actual tickets as they stated and electric tickets were available only hours before the concert Very disappoint i will never use this vender again
Part 41A100 purchased part 40A100 sent to us
I ordered product from Banggood January 11th 2017 The product was shipped on January 15th 2017 with and estimated delivery time between February 5th to 10th I eagerly watched my mailbox everyday as it was to be delivered via Canada Post On February 10th my package still had not arrived I emailed Banggood to inquire if they were able to track the package for me I was instructed to wait 5 to 7 more days which I did no package Emailed again and received the same generic response After many emails back and forth with me asking for tracking possibly resending the package etc I was sent an email informing me that they could refund my money OR resend another package No apologies no discount as far as Im concerned ZERO customer service I have waited a month and a half to receive product from them and to them its just an Oh well situation I have never been made to feel that my worth as a consumer and my dollars mean so little Im beyond upset by the treatment lack of customer service and general attitude of this company I cant believe they are still in business At this point I have been told I will be receiving a full refund within 7 to 14 business days Im not holding my breath Im so disappointed Even if I do receive a refund doubtful considering their customer service thus far I will have to source order and wait all over again to get what I want
Ive been with Goldmoneycom since 2013
Initially it looked good when James Turk was running it There was a sense of quality and very responsive customer service
Now you would be lucky to get a person on the phone Even email inquiries are ignored
Customers store their wealth in chosen vaults all over the world Europe Asia Canada Customers do this for a reason However if someone wants to redeem their precious metals they are informed that the company only ships from the USA I only learned this from reading reviews here on Trustpilot
When I signed up with Goldmoney I read through everything they had available on their site and there was no mention of this in 2013
My confidence in the company is enormously undermined

WHERE ARE ANSWERS TO THESE LETTERS 
Slow to respond to calls mismatch between that document status was on website and what i was told by letters asked for NCT cert even though I sent the disc this was not accepted Although haven spoken to a solicitor we could see no reason for this Nor was your agent able to explain why full cert was needed over the NCT disc Agents we never rude but were not empowered to do anything Asked to speak to their manager I was told they were not willing to talk to me
Im not sure if my unit came from a bad batch however I was not pleased with what I received The length was not the same as others who reviewed this item before me I was very disappointed with my purchase
Took over a week to deliver my item ended up buying from elsewhere then returning the item from Outdoor and Country when it arrived
Ive ordered twice so far from this site both times upon placing an order I received a notice that although it doesnt happen often my contacts were on back order Thats 2 out of 2 times doesnt seem like a coincidence to me The pricing is changing as well First time around there were no extra fees or shipping charges but when I ordered second time I was hit with both I think this is outrageous I wont be using them again
Ive used many online booking agents but Agoda would have to be the worst I booked and paid for accommodation only to be told a week later that the accommodation provider didnt have any space and that there was no where to stay in any other hotel or motel because everything was booked out for the festival I chose Agoda and this accommodation provider over others but by the time
they told me they had made a mistake there was no accomodation left within 60 km of my destination They offered a refund but said it would take up to 30 days to process the refund So they take your money straight away but then cant give it back for 30 days You cant ring them you have to communicate by email and every time you send an email someone different replies and just cuts and pastes their replies With the same pathetic robotic apology which is so insincere its actually quite funny Never again Agoda Lift your game
I paid for a tri fidget spinner and there never came an verification email or when i was gonna get it
When you went to the store the experience was great Sales were nice and helpful Funiture looks great and feels great on the floor Everyone seems friendly when purchasing Since our first purchase the we have had one of our 2 items we purchased replaced due to the reclining portion not latching less than a month later Super easy just called explained it and the manager had a new one ordered and here in less than a week Now here we are less than 90 days from purchase and the love seat is making a metal on metal grinding when it rocks and the replament has the seam threads falling out Tried to call back and tell them they need swapped out and now oh no you have to photo everything and send it to us to be sent to the claims to see if its covered When we purchased the extra warranty stuff it was explained just call tell us whats going on and we will get another set out to you So beware what you purchase and what warranty services you purchase as well it may not be worth the hassle If you do purchase I highly suggest getting delivery replacement or you will have to lug that furniture back and further yourself
did not receive item after 50 days and the seller refuses to refund or reship
Ciao SNCB je ne prendrai plus le train
Agent was supposed to pick up at collision center with rental at a certain time arrived 20 mins late and without car We had to follow him to the shop we would have gone there in the first place Agent was sloppy unprofessional and drove through a red light Car was fine but I can get better service pretty much anywhere else Nope nope nope
I didnt realise they took 29 from your transaction amount I sold a 750 item on Gumtree and the buyer wanted the security of a possible resolution method in the event of problems Now that is fair enough but nowhere on the headlines on the website is this pointed out Still fair enough Getting the money into my own bank was a farce Why do they hang on to your money for up to 3 days  well you can guess and they use your security and well being as an excuse Imagine going to your bank and filling out forms in triplicate to make a withdrawal It is calculated to make them money on top of the 29 i am sure
And just a warning some years ago my daughter sold a big ticket item on Ebay and was paid via a stolen credit card which was not reported for three days Ebay then demanded the payment returned and Paypal threatened to put it in the hands of debt collectors if the money was not transferred back to them immediately In dealing with them on the phone i found they couldnt care less Despite being advised by a solicitor and the fraud department of the police that the demand from Paypal should be ignored I told her to return the money as she did not need a CCJ hanging over her
Paypal showed their true colours on that occasion Make your own choice 
Please can you send me the EU address for the return of a dress and shoes I ordered Both items dont fit they are both too small I have read the shoes I ordered which was a standard size 3 were made to ordermeasure therefore I cant return them This surely cant be true can it If this is the case I will certainly be advising people NEVER to order from you as unfortunately your returns policy is dreadful I feel disappointed Im having to go public with my review however there is no option to directly email a team member again a huge failing on your companys behalf as people will read your reviews and decide not to shop with you
They said online that they tried to deliver but they didnt try it There was no attempt to buzz my apartment or anything Now I have to drive far to get it I was literally outside my house at the time it says online as attempted delivery
CarRental8 site allowed us to book a mid size SUV stating it would fit 2 large and 2 medium suitcases On arrival at Alamo we were informed that that class of car was too small for the 4 suitcases and that we should upgrade to a Large SUV The Alamo rep was correct we fitted the 4 suitcases in the large SUV without a lot of space to spare we wouldnt have fitted in a smaller car
The info on the site was misleading  even though we researched the type of car suggested on line to compare to a make and model we were familiar with Alamos mid size SUV where not the same as suggested on CarRental8
Very disappointed with the outcome of my dealings with this company
In short the car would not turn over Towed back to work shop diagnosed as a key problem Instead of replacing the key they put a new part in the old key tapped it up and told me it may last and strongly advised me to purchase a new key then proceeded charged me 32000 for taping a new part in an old key that wont last WHAT THE They didnt even give me a choice to replace or repair
I could have purchase a new genuine key from the dealer coded to the vehicle for 33880 how does that work
The Manager of the Caboolture Branch told me he was going to call me back in 2mins with a response Im still waiting I did get a call from his mechanic however Very disappointed Poor customer service skills Shame on Lube Mobile for allowing a Person in that position who has no customer service skills to be working at your establishment
Seriously what kind of circus are you running
I would not recommend this rock show to anyone Especially in the Caboolture area
I recently tried this service to have iCloud lock removed from a device But after doing multiple check on my imei to see if it was block listed and all result showed that it was clean Iphoneimeinet sent me an email stating my imei is block listed and I cant get given a refund either The issue is on their term and condition page they recommend websites to check imei number that I used and it came back clean So I expect my phone to be unlocked now or be refunded
Support is very bad they ban your account without reasons it is almost impossible to log in it is very annoying that they ban your account when you have your money inside it is really a service disgust I say sincerely my account was banned with money in
Support is bad because when you try to contact to ask you to help you recover your account you get thousands and thousands of meaningless excuses
The last time they deactivated my account and they reactivated it but they deactivated it again
I recommend users to be very careful because the support is so bad that it looks like a horror movie precisely when it comes to your money
The support does not help at all just incoherent excuses with little logical sense and is a good waste of time
I have even lost patience with the poor support of this service that proclaims itself Quality Team
I bought the cheapest flight ticket I found with 3 stops that lasted 2 days and a half to get me to my destination it was grand total of 674  TAX INCLUDED After I bought it I was charged a total of 915  I complained and this company did not take any responsibility and blame the customer when it was clear that Flighthub its a tricky company that does fraud After talking to at least 3 people for about 2 hours the RUDE Supervisor agreed to give my money back You have to get really rude unfortunately for this company to take you seriously Worst experience ever ruined my morning Never again and definitely will never recommend it to anyone
Tracker rarely connects to GPS  give false information Also beware you only find out how bad it is once you purchase the tracker  yearly subscription yes they market it as monthly no contract but you can only purchase 1yr or 2yr subscription
Claims
 notifies you if tracker lost didnt work
 set safe fence notified me 4hrs after the dog had gone outside safe zone
 live tracking occassionally connects  then loses connection constantly
My dog was off leash heading towards busy road did not recall him back as it was showing him in the safe field
This product almost got my dog killed  worst product I have know for false promises
Contact them  they offer no refund not even the subscrition
Solicitors have now been contacted
280 Out of pocket due to a cancelled flight which I had to pay to rebook and no customer service resolution Avoid last minute com and Bravofly as they take you money but no ownership
Send me my book please
I ordered a key and paid to have it shipped overnight The key that was received did not work It would not even go into the keyhole I called customer service and was able to explain the situation I sent them a picture of the key they had sent me and pictures of the lock face They sent out a new key that day overnight with the explanation that the key should have been double sided When I received the new key the next day it also would not work
Customer service was not helpful when I called back to complain and would not refund my shipping fees They would only refund the key charges I felt that this was not a good business practice as their product totally failed They should have covered the entire expense I asked to speak to a manager and the rep asked me to hold then came back on the line to tell me a manger said they can not refund the shipping
The whole experience was disappointing at best I feel that the company should have been more willing to work with me
I received a code from them and they requested a video proof that I tried unlocking I send screen shots with all the proof and that wasnt enough In the process I had to find someone with a phone get them to do the video and send I will not use them ever again
Salesman lied to me
Terrible  ordered white flowers for condolence of a family death and a bright bouquet of flowers was delivered instead a day late
I had a start loop problem with my iPhone 5s and after trying different solutions from internet i finally decided to spend the money and buy Dr Fone iOS System Recovery 70 euros and all it did is tell me to contact costumer support the support offered a pdf software as consolation this product is completely useless and absolutely not worth the money you will have to buy a new phone anyway BEWARE
Far away different what you see on the web and what you get My injeck printer gives me more quality I dont recommend this product Seriously I know it looks really nice on the screen but it is not disappointing
These cookies were hard as stone tasteless and stale First time I have received an unsatisfactory product from Figis but theres always a first time I will never order bake goods again
Really pricey High customs taxes Product with faults Support service trying to convince me to repair them local instead of refunding or repairing them
Bad idiot staffs false company
I purchased this book in good faith that the condition would be good Granted I did not pay much I believe that it was 4 But I did not expect the cover to be as damaged as it turned out to be The description was not an honest one
You have to read the fine print regarding how you will be charged the full amount at time of the reservation and a cancellation fee will apply if you change plans andor cancel I will know better next time
I splurged on ordering 2 lamps for around 400 When they arrived they were MUCH larger than listed and expected I only half opened one and repacked it to original state Didnt even open the other After having to call customer service and routed to two people I was told that they needed to contact the manufacturer to see what was possible and get back to me I was later told that the manufacturer would not accept any returns and that my only option was to pay for shipping myself back to the RCWilley facility in Utah BIG shipping bill RCwilley customers buy products from YOU not the manufacturer So either come up with a decent return policy or pick better manufacturers Consumers dont buy anything unless you are 100 confident you wont need to return it
My dad used the Guardian and while he was alive was a good experience The issue I need to share with everyone is I cant return the units and get my refund I keep calling and ask for the RMA they say I will gat an email with the information but it never comes I asked for it to be mailed and still it hasnt come Such a shame to add another problem with all the other problems one has to deal with after their last surviving parent passes away
Havent received my order or email that have send order but it may be on road these 2202017
My booking was cancelled because the name on the payment card didnt match the person traveling Apparently I cant buy my wife a flight with you
not recomended
I ordered the wrong moldings for my stairs however they were not custom pieces and I didnt even open the box that they were shipped in they refused to take them back The stair moldings I ordered were not custom pieces or sizes they were the standard sizes they offered I would never order from them again
Does not do what it says it will do no free trial website does not cooperate
As I was booking my flight your site CRASHED and I was charged TWICE for ONE ticket for ONE person I sent several emails and wasted phone calls and MY time to tell me that they were sorry and nothing can be done I was told a Refund was not going to be given only a Flight Credit Which means I have One Year to Travel somewhere REALLY Their site crashes and I am out of 500 because of it NEVER USE THIS SITE Not trustworthy at all
Make sure you research properly as you are not aloud to change any details on it once paid
I was always Under the impression that Groupon was here so that they could save the consumer money by selling bulk couponGroupon I have since found out that you can find much better deals by just looking Ive found the exact same pressure washer that I bought from Groupon for 100 less by going to a big box store Ive been taken to the cleaners buying a Las Vegas Hotel Groupon only to find out I over paid by hundreds of dollars Do your due diligence prior to buying through Groupon I think youll find that it pays to look else where
The actual process was straightforward but I didnt find out until after the booking that the pickup is not at the airport but I have to get a bus to another place for the car I didnt this any earlier although perhaps I just missed it
I often shop at RCWilley and will continue but this last purchase experience needs to be said
It was a small ceramic dog to be picked up at the warehouse When I picked it up the warehouse guy would not hand me the box and carried it all the way to my car and set it in the trunk I thought this was strange since it was the size of a shoebox why he wouldnt just hand it to me I signed and went home When I got home I went to pick up the box and as I barely touched it you could hear it was completely shattered There is no way anyone in contact with this box would not know this I understand that broken items happen but my problem is why the warehouse couldnt just say hey this is broken and go from there They purposely gave me a broken one Well I drove back to the store and returned it for a refund What a waste of my time My advice always check your boxes before signing Lesson learned
I went to Nippon Yassan to purchase a PSN Japan card The sign up and checkout had no issues and as it said it can take up to 24 hours to receive I was not concerned when I didnt hear anything immediately
It wasnt until the next day that I received an email from them requesting that I send them photos of my ID through their ticket system on the website as they needed to confirm the transaction and it would be illegal to progress without it I spent over half hour trying to submit photos using their system and was repeatedly getting errors as it would not accept them due to file size
I sent another reply through the ticket system advising them of this and asked if they could get back to me ASAP as I was getting the PSN code to use in a sale that ended in a few days
I didnt get a reply until the next day which was a short message advising me to upload photos of my ID and credit card to a website and to send them the link In addition to this I checked my card statement and they had already taken the payment I was not happy with this but was able to use a secure site I had access to for uploading photos and sending a link advising them of the above on the ticket system again
Next day there was no reply I checked the site to find that they were closed at the weekend and the sale I needed the card for was ending Monday I went onto Play Asia and picked up the same card for cheaper as they had a 5 off and received it immediately I then updated my ticket on Nippon Yassan to say that I could not wait any longer and had brought one from another source hence I would like my order cancelled and my payment refunded as I had not received the goods
Monday morning I had an email saying they were processing my order and a few minutes after that my code arrived I was absolutely furious as they had obviously seen the messages on the ticket system or they wouldnt have been able to look at my ID and since the latest message was at the top it would have been impossible to miss  meaning it was ignored The code was sent too late anyway for me to use in the sale i wanted and as it was a 10000 yen card being charged again when i explicitly asked them to cancel is a horrific service
I will not be using them again
Stop sending me emails
Read above still waiting
I bought my tickets in August After several phone calls and emails including having to take a day off of work my tickets finally arrived a few hours before the event Feb 14th I got no sympathy for the stress time spent figuring out what was the delay and zero concern I had to miss a day of work to wait for my tickets I will never use them again

A joke of an insurance company 3 notices and your policy gets cancelled even though they give you very little notice when your kilometres get low The bonus kilometres never happen and the support services are terrible Cheap insurance at the beginning and then you have to top up when the kilometres go low so youre spending as much topping up as you would have buying insurance with a better company  Would never insure with these again

Back in August 20016 I booked a room Maui hawaiiHololani rentals Immediately upon booking I realized that there was no note of unit being equipped with air conditioner I immediately Im talking minutes after I booked I statmrtes chatting with Leah and expressed my concern to her Leah could not find any information in the website about the unit being equipped with AC unit or not She then suggested to get back to me the following business day Which never happened I had to call back myself At this point they couldnt even find my booking or info Took them several days I also spoke to a Lauren over the phone at Vacatia and told me that she had forwarded my issue to the manager and that they would get back to me in an estimated time They didnt so I called them I was forwarded to a person named Dan I requested a unit with AC due to medical issues with my kids I explained that they needed to be in a controlled environment He explained to me that none of the units in that building had Air conditioners So I requested accommodations somewhere else To justify my childrens needs He then proceeded to tell me that he couldnt make that decision at the time He needed to speak to a supervisor and then would get back to me He didnt so I called them again I was forwarded to Lauren Which in return told me that the supervisor is Dan So Dan lied to me about whom he really was I was very perplexed about why he would do such a thing This was a serious matter No one appreciates being miaelead this way Lauren then transfers the call to Dan He sounded annoyed and hesitant by my issue Basically told me that it was my fault for booking without paying attention and proceeded to arrogantly lecture me about my decision and the responsibility I had to take Months later Im stuck with a bill for services that where never rendered to me or my family Without any regards to me or my family Vacatia rift along with his employees took advantage of me and practiced very poor business etiquette Not once was Dan the supervisor was willing to make other arrangements with me He had the power to make a difference and make our vacation possible and instead took our money and ran with it Never to follow up with me Simply took our money without remorse Its very unfortunate that when you open up the link to website they do nothing but praise a pleasant family oriented stay at any of their destinations But beware Theres a hidden agenda When you the customer figure things out Its a too late For they VACATIA Will do nothing for you except take your money without regard

So I booked flights through flighthub I thought I booked an early departing flight When I got my itinerary it said I had an overnight flight Seeing as I am under 18 I called to see if there is anything they could do to get me on an earlier flight I got a major run around and was on the phone for 2 hours After the two hours the answer I had was that I wasnt even allowed to be on the flight on the first place and I was going to have to pay to fix THEIR MISTAKE I was not going to do this so I had my father call He explained the situation and they said because of what happened they would waive the cancellation fee and refund all my money Within 2 minutes there was a charge of 7500 on my card and no refund in sight The next day I got a refund of 1495 from flighthub so I called there and they said that the company had refunded me in full After being on the phone for almost an hour or more they said that the cost of my ticket would be refunded and then just hung up Terrible service And when we asked to talk to someone higher up the same lady answered and gave us a different name Simply scammers Never book through them

We have not had the experience we were hoping to have
Most cartridges did not work even after replacement Original order shipped in an envelope causing many of the five cartridges to be damaged with ink secreting out of most of them Company rep apologized said that an envelope should not have been used for such a large order Replacement cartridges shipped in a box received late the following week with three of the color cartridges still not working properly oozing ink Some cartridges did not match  structurally different from each other Bottom line A poor experience Will not use Inkfarm again Our new cartridges are made by HP and work perfectly even though the inside of our printer is now stained with ink by the Inkfarm leaking cartridges from our first and only Inkfarm transaction
I would never order from you again I spent Over  7000 dollars paid for an extra teddy bear which was not received The overall order was not worth what I paid I give 2 stars because my daughter was very happy and surprised
Its a fraud charging that kind of margins for tickets I could have bought at half of the price but didnt know at the time
Someone created an account with my bank info and requested 7500 over 3 transactions I called and asked for help and have not heard anything back
I have ordered my frames for the last three years from Frames Direct This has been the worst experience ever The representatives gave me the run around as it related to a pair of sunglasses that I had chose to order although the sunglasses were out of stock I never received a phone call I was emailed Next I had to contact Frames Direct directly only to find out that the individual that was handling my order was not in the office
The big issue with Truecar is that they just parrot whatever the dealers tell them and claim no responsibility for providing bad information My experience was that I found a great deal on a car I wanted contacted the dealer and was told they didnt have that car any more but had some more expensive vehicles I might like I then tried a different car and had the exact same experience with a different dealer  bait and switch At that point I saw how the game was played and refused to play any more
DO NOT SIGN UP WITH THIS COMPANY
I have been trying to cancel since October 2016 and each month I phone get email confirmation and it still comes out of my account Once you sign up its impossible to leave and the bank cannot cancel it has to be done through them I am with HSBC
I had told the person that I was being guarantor for to advise I was working and no calls to be made to me until a set time 4 missed calls later and 4 voice mails later they send me a text telling me they would call after I finish at half 5 No surprise that they call me at 529 Stop calling people if they dont answer the first time Take the hint
im a bit surprised actually  i emailed intrepid over a week ago about a trip I would like to make and havent heard back
We love Omega service and the car you provided But as we returned the car around 4am to the Airpark the attitude of the lady at the reception was really offensive While I was returning the car key she asked me where is you car parked But I didnt understand it for a minute Im Asian she repeated it with really insulting expression on her face

I went on flora2000 to order flowers for my fiance I ordered it 4 days before valentines day It was delivered on timethat was good but something was wrong The flowers did not look like the pictures on their website Heres the kicker the chocolates were nothing i mean nothing like what i ordered It was just like they got the order picked some random flower and chocolate and delivered it I think they actually thought people wont notice these are people that actually ordered something based on the picture on the websitelike any reasonable person I dont know about anybody else but i spent a couple of days trying to find the right flower based on the damn picture on their website So what did i do you might ask I did what even superman would do I called flora2000 but the line was busy hmm why oh why What did i do next I went on their website and looked for contact information Guess what it said we are busy just send an email here and here so convenient easier for them not to respond But i wasnt thinking like then I was like any reasonable human being It makes sense that they would be busy then after all it was valentines day SO I sent an email to Richard hmm if thats a real person real people with a heart would respond unless hes a member of ISIS and wait and waited Today Im sick and tired of waiting I paid a higher amount for a lower quality product Its like paying for a Mercedes and getting a Toyota noting against Toyota but Mercedes is my dream car My goal now is to go to every review site in the world and tell the whole universe how flora 2000 is nothing more then an organization of thieves

I booked a flight CPH  ATH for the 16th of March leaving from Copenhagen 1510 and arrive in Athens with a stop at Brussels airport and last Thursday I was informed that my flight has been modified When I checked the new itinerary the first part of the flight CPH  BRU had been cancelled I called the travelgenio and a representative provided an alternative flight from CPH  BRU at 830 in the morning As I explained I could not accept since I am working that day and to be mentioned that the alternative means 14h flight just to travel from CPH to ATH Ive been told that the flight had been cancelled by the airline and to call them directly I said that it is not my responsibility to call and that I would like to know if they can offer an alternative flight from 1500 and later on or the refund They finally said that they were going to call the air  company and call me back In the meanwhile I called also by myself the air company to know what is the situation and I have been told that the flight has not been cancelled as flight and to call back the agency as I did At the second call they said that they are proceeding with the refund and I asked if I could have in written what they were suggested but they refused Then I contacted the company requesting in written my alternatives They replied that they have received my confirmation and are proceeding with the refund and that I will shortly receive news I replied back again clarifying that I never sent any confirmation but I was requesting my alternatives in a written professional way explaining all the story from the beginning and asking again either for an alternative flight after 1500 or the full refund I still havent received any reply while asking for the status every day and I am with two tickets in my hands BRU  ATH and ATH  CPH that I am not able to use if we do not resolve the issue
I ordered an arrangement of tulips to be delivered to ManorCare NORTH yesterday 3222017 They never arrived I called your customer service number and was connected to an associate named Jasper who was no help whatsoever No one knows where the flowers are At first Jasper said he would redeliver the flowers tomorrow Then he called back and said there would be an additional 18 charge Then he called back and said the charge would 26 at which time I cancelled the order I feel as though I have been scammed Jasper refused to let me speak to a supervisor I will NEVER order flowers from your company again and I will tell everyone I know not to order from you

I bought a pair on clearouts that was saying only one in stock that would get ship the next day or as they call it same day dispatch the plane logo I got my order confirmation and they took the payment on my credit card A week later they send me an email saying that the model is discontinued and that they cant get it anymore I called the Canadian distributor which is also the manufacturer and they have the model in question still available I gave many options to SmartBuyGlasses to make me happy and still do the transaction I ask for the same model with a different combo framelens NO different models that were the same value before the clearouts price that was showing in stock NO models cheaper NO models non polarized which was my original purchase still NO After many emails the only things they are willing to do is give me a 5 extra discount which you can get just by registering to the newsletter Its easy to sell something you dont have at a lower price and then get the customer to pay more for the same model that wasnt in clearouts I cant even get a generic store to do a price match since they dont advertise it anymore
Your delivery person argued with me One chair in a five piece set was broken and it was decided by a manager that the whole set would be replaced The delivery man kept questioning why I needed a whole new set when he could just swap out one chair Each time he came in he brought it up It was none of his business other than delivering it

Ordered three pairs of sunglasses last week Found out this morning they cancelled my order at my request I emailed to find out what was going on They did email me on a Thursday asking for a room or house number which is weird because I have never needed one when ordering anywhere else My order should have been processed They replied with a Hi what professional company uses an ellipses like that and told me they emailed me asking about the address They couldnt even proper time before cancelling my order at my request Sorry I didnt email them back during my grandmothers funeral I simply replied with a Nope at reordering to which the company replied back with a Nope as well Dont know what thats supposed to mean Petty petty Very unprofessional
I ordered a pair of Nike 897 glasses with progressive lenses I filled out everything on the prescription form Waited a month to receive my glasses When I put them on it was like looking through a view master Everything was 3D exaggerated and was very dangerous to drive with The up close portion of the glasses were fine After a week I went to my eye doctor and had them check the lenses out to find out if there was something wrong with them or if it was just that my eyes hadnt adjusted to them yet He told me that there was no way I would ever be able to see through them because there was only 14 of the very top of the glasses that was for distance and my eyes cant even see through that portion The segment height was way too high I told him that there wasnt anywhere on the prescription form that asked for the segment height He told me to have SmartBuyGlasses fix them I called the support line and they did everything they could to say I ordered the wrong glasses or I must have entered the prescription wrong I told them the segment height was way off and there wasnt anywhere on the form that asked for it I told them I wanted them fixed with the proper segment height of 19mm and they said they cant do that I said well you cant sell progressive lenses without a segment height After arguing with them for awhile they said hold on just a minute When they came back they said I just talked to a technician and they said we can do it So I sent my glasses back and in about 2 weeks or a little more I received my new glasses They were a lot better but I still couldnt see right out of them I went back to the eye doctor for him to check my glasses again and the segment height was still way high Not as high as before but still too high for my eyes to be able to use that portion of the prescription I decided to order new lenses from him and what a difference that made He told me that the materials and technology used to create the lenses were old and subpar I also noticed that while checking the tracking number that my glasses was shipped from Hong Kong Anyway if you need progressive lenses then steer clear of this place and anywhere else online The glasses have to be put on your face to determine what the segment height should be and every pair of glasses is different because of there shape and how they sit on your face Bottom line it was a waist of time and money It was like pulling teeth to get SmartBuyGlasses to even try to fix the problem the first time They should refund my prescription lenses
Stated as in stock then said a few days later out of stock
Supposedly delay was due to weather Received email on day after scheduled delivery I made the call back and the person that answered had such a bad attitude Supplier Maine Lobster Now claimed they tried to call me but no record of such a call He acted as if it was my fault that they did not deliver the product on time Lobsters arrived 2 days late and DEAD Product was probably packed and set for 2 days before shipping
Paid premium price for product for poor product and service Costly mistake on my part when I used Maine Lobster Now Never again
I am sure there are other good suppliers available so I will not use Maine Lobster Now again
I paid an extra 50Euro for priority check in after reading reviews of very long queues to check in When I got to the airport there is no priority check in you just queue with everyone else There is 1 desk with only 1 person behind it I asked to pay in Euro but was charged in GBP This cost me quite a bit more A very disappointing start to the holiday
Could not have had a worse experience Food never came and I was charged 48 more than I was supposed to be Will never use again
Directions said to call if you were going to be more than an hour late from the appointed time We called 5 hours prior to getting to our destination that we would be an hour and a half late and was told they would note that on our reservation We were held up as were all other flights to Florida because the President was flying so everyone was late Got to the airport transportation area and called them for pickup was told 10 minutes over 30 minutes later someone finally showed up and he told us the vehicle had been rented because we were more than an hour lateas I said earlier every flight was late They said they no longer had the 6 passenger vehicle but we could rent a carhowever not as cheaply as our initial rental We needed a 6 passenger vehicle so I told off the driver and we ended up paying twice as much as we had to find a vehicle available Looks like if if you follow the directions they will find a way out of the deal If it sounds too good to be true it is Will never rent from them anywhere Classic bait and switch

I was happy with the service until my last purchase Unfortunately I had order two pairs of canvas black shoes to find there were a wider fitting shoe than they looked on display I requested from customer service to accept these back without I having to pay for postage but customer service did not agree to this I will be very slow in puchasing items again As it would cost alot to return purchases if they are not what they appear in advertising Anne

I had a return flight cancelled from Beijing to Xiamen and they were so bad I had to book another flight myself the service I received was terrible now I cant get a response from email as to where when or if I will get a refund Terrible service poor communication Avoid at all costs
From the start I had very poor communication and the customer service staff need more training Had belongings stored in Melbourne but was living in Sydney which seem too confuse staff quiet a lot even with telling them my stuff was in Melbourne so was always passed back and fourth Was given wrong information when signing up which lead us to being behind in our first payment Spent a couple of months with that problem but the worse was having my taxi boxes dropped off and my locks cut and no one at the property so my things were free to take Now I did ask for my locks to be cut as I lost the keys and have them replaced which needed to be paid for but I went in to the office to do this myself Now after this happening i asked to be refunded the new locks which they kindly did but no without abit of drama
59 minutes on phone for changing a flight

Absolutely annoyed Been with PayPal for 12 years and they restricted my account and stopped my funds with a silly reason of me selling a product which is a supplement and not any illegal drug on eBay using PayPal checkout Been selling this for years and now they have stopped it and didnt give any warning and now cannot be reversed  Absolutely shocking
I called for a trip confirmation on Feb 27 2017 A man who called himself Andii said that for 946 he had a flight for melisting all details He SAID he couldnt confirm it unless I gave him ALL my personal information like birthdate mailing address home phone  as well as my full Visa card I said why He said company policy and cant book flight without So I gave him He saysoh sorry this fight not available and then looks at another onedespite website showing 10 other alternatives for 946 he says this one is 971 So o agree again Then I tell him I have cap on my visa and need to increase it How much time do I have He gave me confirmation  and says 30 minutes Called visa I was back in 10 mins
Called companythey said it was called because not enf funds I said why he went ahead when I told him what I was going to do So I now rebooked This woman now says flights for 946 are available I got really mad and told herstop Something wrong I rushed to my visa people and they told me 52933 was charged together with ANOTHER 52933both half an hour apart This 53933 amount was only half the ticket Where was the rest They said you have to go back and get company to debit my acct
I spent over 1 12 hours with transit  from visa to get my amts cancelled Woman said she could do one BUT couldnt find other one as there was no confirmation number I explained everything I said how can you charge when I never approved It was a huge huge long argument They hung up on me as I demanded both charges be returned immediately without penalty as they did not charge whole amount and told me so many stories What was weird is she knew the trans  for both but couldnt find confirmation  What How can you lose info In less than 12 hour
I checked next day online to visacharges have been posted but no credits I have visa now taking these amounts for scamming and dispute
This whole mess held me on the phone and wasted my time for over 3 12 hours
They said they refunded but they didnt
This was a band of thieves working insideall together
NEVER again will I trust this company AND I will go on Facebook and tell ALL my friends and public about this thieving company Furthermore we will involve the police where this company is located

I had used Weslend to refinance a home 4 years ago and it was a seamless experience Not this time Communication from Weslend was terrible Every single interaction was a struggle I should have used Quicken Loans We based our decision to use Weslend on our initial estimate from them They used the wrong information to calculate our payments and after everything was said and done our loan was almost 400 a month higher than the estimate Totally unacceptable

It is a scam  the company only wants your money and offer NOTHING
Not very good service here same reply when I ask about when I will get my report grade Dminus we called these people and after over one month it has not been processed yet We asked for our money back and they wanted half of what we paid for It also took 13 days from when we mailed the test kit in till they noted they received it look elsewhere people this is a scam

I ordered a sectional on black Friday 2016 I had to special order it because I need it reversed long end and short end swapped
Six weeks later it arrived in the wrong color so I went to the store and spoke with the sales person who reordered it for me Two months later the sectional finally arrived again This time the right color but not reversed so it would not fit in my living room Accepting the fact that they could not order my couch correctly Gardner White finally just gave me a refund I will NEVER even consider shopping at Gardner White ever again Customer service was mediocre at best
Horrible
I wish I had read these reviews I paid for rush delivery for first thing this morning to a hospital knowing my friend would probably be discharged today The arrangement was supposed to arrive by 10 am but half an hour later still no delivery confirmation I call the company and she indicates my delivery time is supposed to be today by 10 am Yes no kidding thats why Im calling The rep puts me on hold and says she apologizes for the delay but they cannot locate the flowers because they are on a delivery truck somewhere She cannot give me a time frame they will arrive just that it will be sometime today I told her this isnt good enough because the patient may be discharged later so she asks for my friends home address to deliver the flowers there if she has in fact been discharged by then I told her I do not have my friends address and the whole point was to send her flowers in the hospital
She offered to refund my rush fee to which I responded I will get more than that refunded It would have been nice if someone had at least told me the flowers were going to be late But this way makes it much easier for them to keep their rush delivery fee and just hope Im not paying attention
For a large company I expected more I learned my lesson for next time
when i place my call through wifi still i get charged even after i actually bought the bad subscription of unlimited calls to india 10 month

Order was easy to make pay and set up
But two weeks later Ive only just received my ink parcel I needed it well over a week ago
Delivery instructions were not adhered to
On the upside customer service email reply was prompt initially
Spooky and they dont have everything in stock And a china feeling on the lamp
When I called in yesterday to advise about a problem with a melted battery  caught fire during charging  I thought I would hear back immediately I know it is only 36 hours but I still thought I would hear back from customer service before this I will call customer service tomorrow
Unfortunately they got my order wrong Resolved quickly but still a hassle I didnt need
Overnilled and money lost between Carrental 8 and Advantage Very sad and expensive experience
Having to chase your shipment all over town is an extreme hassle UPS will randomly show up at your door and then charge you extra to ship to one of their stores which are often full and then require you to ship across town

Too bad xpensive for what was actually delivered The cookies were okay at best
I have been denied boarding on October 25 2016 with no reasons or explanations given despite of paid and confirmed ticket purchased directly from Air Berlin In order to make the Frankfurt connection I ended up purchasing a fullprice Lufthansa ticket just minutes before departure Subsequent attempts to reach Air Berlin customer service not surprisingly were disregarded Mistakes happen and a simple explanation and perhaps an apology from the Air Berlin would go a long way to win loyal customers
I presume Im having to rewrite this cause I mentioned the name of a certain competitor that delivers next day and never kept me waiting 2weeks anyone who reads this my unnamed supplier sends out end of working day and with these I may as well got off gbay they wanted 17 for next day delivery so I presume thats why it goes snail delivery on the free which Ive never had that problem off their competitor listen my point is it was just a trial and I shall be going back to normal supplier mg and now you only get 1 star for making me rewrite a honest review if you dont like it fix your problems not everyone are sheep
Changed over to Energia last yearv having been promised percentage reductions for this that and the other Very disappointed as I thought my bills would be cheaper than with my previous supplier However overall I am spending more on electric bills now than before Am reverting back to my previous supplier once my contract is up
I have not had a chance to correspond with the company yet but when I inquired from the person I sent it too They said that the items did not seem fresh and that the advertisement seemed to make it look a lot better then it was Im not sure as I did not have a cookie on the taste
They want way to much info from me  Now Im getting phone solicitors calling from using their site  Says 50 free shipping  had to call because online could not process  Then at the end they tell me 75 free shipping  Not what it says online  Then they got real testy with me  like Im cheap  Well to put it this way  they can go belittle the next costumer  Im most likely not doing anymore business with those people  Think people is a bit strong for those low life slugs from hell garbage mold slim buckets
To be honest I was shocked as I received the goods unfortunately I gave it the benefit of doubt and just washed everything and now I am told I cant return the goods any more The 2 bedsheets are so thin that you can look through One of the comforter cover looks like it was made by a child it was very badly sewn and there are loose threads hanging everywhere The other comforter cover seems not the colors as on the bedsheets In summery you get what you pay  I thought that I can save some money but if I compare the quality with what we have already I clearly see that I saved on the wrong end If you need cheap bed covering with no quality and that wont last long here is the place to buy But if you need some sort of quality dont buy anything here
Lost item unacceptable return and exchange policy
After trying 6 onnit products I cant say Ive noticed any difference and with the amount of money thats kinda shitt I will continue to use what Ive bought and hope the results come
When I didnt get my order by two weeks I called and was put on hold for over 20 minutes When I finally got someone to talk to I was told my order came back because the zip code was incomplete Now whos fault is that They sent he order out again and I finally got it about 6 days later
This delay in service held up my being able to copy out my W2s to send to my accountant Lousy service
most vouchers were for 50
I wish there was a way to give this company minus stars I setup shipping from US to Korea and it wouldnt let me print the label Customer service non existent unless you are willing to wait a day for any response They promised me my money back but still havent seen refund for my first try Turns out the address line was over its limit so I decided to give a second chance Boy what a mistake that was My box got shipped to the IL facility but no one seems to know where my box is They emailed me and told me they would look into it and that was 2 days ago Save yourself the headache and worry and just go with USPS
On Thursday the tracking website indicated that my parcel was on the truck and would be delivered by 8pm on Thurs  I contacted the hotline to request a more accurate delivery time  Unable was the reply  Well can you tell me the location of the truck so that I can get an approximate idea of delivery schedule  Sorry we dont know that  Well can you phone the driver and ask him  No we cant do that either  Well 8pm came and went no delivery  At 9pm the website was updated informing me that the truck had broken down early in the day and there was to be no delivery that day I had remained at home from 8am to 8pm waiting delivery  No phone call  no email  no contact of any kind informing me that delivery would not take place that day  Despite contacting the helpline twice during the day 
I was then promised delivery on Friday with delivery again sometime before 8pm 
Foolishly after the debacle from the previous day I expected that I would be afforded some sort of priority or even the courtesy of a more accurate delivery time  Again after contacting the help line and voicing my complaint I requested that a supervisor contact me regarding my complaint  Not unexpectedly the call back did not materialise 
8pm on Friday came and went with NO delivery  So to date I have remained at home for 2 days for absolutely nothing 
This company cannot make deliveries
Cannot contact their customers
Cannot follow up on complaints
Cannot contact their drivers
Cannot track their vehicles
Just what are they capable of doing  Because they seem incapable of making a simple scheduled delivery
Someone in management really needs to shake up this business up because all that I can see is incompetence at every level starting with their core business 
I cannot suggest strongly enough that you avoid this business at all costs
The bouquet I ordered is called Burst Of Happiness  medium sizehowever the flowers that was received were absolutely nothing like the flowers that were ordered while I appreciate some flowers are seasonal  not available this was completely different in colour  flowers also not as many flowers a lot of greenery  I was very disappointed when I saw a photograph of the flowers received  for this reason I will not use Euroflorist again 
Its really a shame Trustpilot is full of scams Its a great idea in theory  giving people a platform for corporate reviews to create more market transparency but of course there will always be some people who just dont know fairplay I cant trust half the reviewes to be legitimate Looks like theyre all either companies trying to make themselves look better than they are OR mostly their competition trying to make them look bad and playing dirty
Dont feed the trolls

I ordered these on 13117 and they arrived on 2917 I opened them and after checking to see that everything was in the box I tried to mount the quick disconnect hardware After having some trouble with the bolt threads I called and was informed that they sent me the wrong bolts They said they would ship new ones I told them I was planning on riding and I need these bags on Sunday They offered to give me a 25 refund so I could go purchase my own bolts I got the hardware on and marked the bag for the holes and drilled them Per their instructions I put the one bag on top of the other to align them so I could mark for the other holes only to find out these bags are not exactly the same and I could either lineup the bottom of the bags or the top bags Basically the right bag is about 18 in taller Than the left bag Some may think this is not a big deal but I just paid 500 For saddlebags and followed the instructions to the letter and my bags will not ride even on my bike because they are not the same size Youd think that would be something they checked before shipping these out Id have posted the PICs of the difference but there is nowhere to upload pics on here
UPDATEThe right side bag is all around defective The top doesnt close correctly and therefore it doesnt lock securely After sending the videos to Viking they said they would send me out a NEW bag Its been almost 2 weeks and still NO BAG Youd think since they SCREWED UP my whole order they would send the bag overnight or at least expedite the shipment NOPE
I ordered flowers on Fri 3rd Feb for my Mums birthday on Sat 4th Feb When wishing her a happy birthday on the Saturday I mentioned flowers would be delivered I received a distressed call from her on Saturday evening to say no flowers were delivered
There was no tracking info on the website  there is no customer service on a Sunday I am furious and appalled at this totally pathetic attempt at customer service Nearly 40 paid  no flowers delivered when they were supposed to be resulting in a lot of upset to my Mum and embarrassment for me
I have no idea what solution this incompetent organisation will come up with but you have spoiled a very special day
2 different sales people told me and my husband was listening that the bill would be 108 plus tax The bill I got today was for more After talking to 3 people JoelAmy and Kim who decreased it for 1 year rather than the 2 year contract that I am signed up for We had wanted to add more service This feels like a bait and switch We got the sports package We have friends over frequently to watch games They will ask how we like dish and now I can only give a negative response I agreed to a 2 year commitment with certain expectations and within the first week I am finding that dish is not delivering what was agreed It is going to be a long 2 years so disappointed
This was my 4th order with lensecart and the sales guy convinced me to go for a higher version ie from vencient to JJ and the results are negative

SELLER SHOWS ONE THING SENDS DIFFERENT ITEM
I placed an order for a bouquet of balloons on 36 for delivery on 37 my daughters birthday I received confirmation they would be delivered on 37 Late in the day 4 or 5pm they sent an email not a phone call that the order has been changed to 38 When I called customer service they assured me that they would arrive 1st thing on 38 The bouquet of balloons arrived in the afternoon minus the 3 additional latex balloons and the teddy bear I am waiting to hear back because I was on hold for over 8 mins Due to the high volume of the Holidaywhat Holiday is on March 8th
I have used flight hub once before and this is my second time Both time when I selected a flight it chose a different one and I didnt have an opportunity to change it  The fees to change are extremely high and in both cases I dont feel it was my fault I will not be using Flight Hub again
The Rental company Firefly has continued to deduct money from my credit card with no explanations
Paid for a 49 business day service still not delivered 14 business days later customer service keep telling you they will update you as soon as they know an eta eta never comes just get the same useless answers each time about them monitoring it and promising to get back to you but you hear nothing
Im not out of pocket by over 430 as the customer has cancelled their order due to non delivery and the goods are untraceable according to parcel muppets
No choice but to go through small claims court now as just get NO ANSWERS FROM THESE USELESS PEOPLE
DO NOT BOTHER  GO ELSEWHERE
I think it is not acceptable that we book tickets with you but do not have the eticket I am going on a business trip and it is very worrying that I dont have any other confirmation other than an email to say hours of trip and that it was not my e ticket In any case we need confirmation of our booking and want to know if we have booked our flight and confirmed a flight with you I would say it is poor service
It took about 4550 mins to get my car The poor desk staff were working so hard and doing the very best they could but they were clearly very under staffed
On my return back to Melbourne from regional Victoria I noticed my windscreen wiper blades were blunt AND there was no water in the windscreen washing tank I had a very stressful 2 hour drive back to the city as it rained the whole way on and off and my visibility was extremely poor

Hello i have been an affiliate for several years with HotelsCombined I have a few websites which has their private branding hotel search script Recently i noticed that the script is no longer working I have sent several emails and filled the form on the website  still did not get any reply My account has reached 85 Reading the online reviews It seems that when you are close to 100 so you can withdraw your commissions they tend to closesuspend accounts or simply just ignore their hard working affiliates What a shame
3rd time in a row forgetting an item  this time dinner rolls  it seems to be the high profit margin items they always forget never chips or low margin items This appears to be a training issue and an international company such as KFC who employ low wage workers should be spending higher margins on training But it seems they dont care  I contacted them several times after they forget an item and they do nothing about it Looks like they still need the profits to support the KKK
I specify that i do not want insurance plan and you add the insurance to my billing I called the service to cancel it and ask to send me an email confirmation and i did not receive that mail Furthermore it was be impossible to find an assistance in french
I put in the ISBNs right off of the book and when they received my books they wouldnt accept one of the books because it was incorrect ISBN so I had to pay them to ship it back to me Horrible
Groupon is a horrible company with horrible customer service They do not vet their third party sellers I recently ordered makeup from them and it never came I spoke to customer service and they were no help I will never use them again They are no Amazon
I placed my order on 21817 On 22817 I got an email notification that my items had finally shipped This is unacceptable I chose standard shipping57 days when I placed my order At this point my order could be wrapped in winning lottery tickets and I still would probably not buy from this company again
Wait five minutes and read this  DO NOT USE SERVICING STOP AT ALL Sent my car in and continually returned in a worse condition In fact they wont even speak to me now Absolute sharks liars deceitful  not disimilar to the reputation of this industry as a whole Do yourself a favour and avoid at all costs
So I Magpied a PS3 PSP Ipod Classic and an Ipod touch The classic and touch I labeled as heavy wear and tear as they had a few scratches The PS3 and PSP both had no scratches and worked perfectly so I labeled them as fair condition I was Quote d 97 and was very happy It has taken over a week and they have listed the PS3 as heavy wear and will only give me 19 I gritted my teeth and accepted as I cant really be bothered to argue about it
Then I get an email telling me the PSP isnt in the box so they wont be paying me for it I emailed back stating that its definitly in there and lo and behold theyve found it but its in poor condition with heavy wear It was practically new when I put it in there so either someone in the warehouse has been dropping things and lowering valuations or they just really dont want to part with the cash
Definitely wont be dealing with these guys in future
When you are shipping our packages I think that you should be more accurate I received messages telling me that fed ex or ups will be delivering my package then I get another message saying that the post office will delivery them which takes much longer

When I typed in the ISBN number for my book brand new edition that just came out 4 months ago they Quote d me one price that looked good so I mailed it to them Once they received it they suddenly decided it was the wrong ISBN and sent a second offer that was for 14 of the original amount Now of course for a sh fee theyll send it back to you I would definitely go with someone else next time

I renewed my policy on the 2401 and to date I still have not received my documents this has been reported on 3 occasions and the issue is still unresloved this is not gooid I find it extremely difficult to have this actioned as communication is via email only I am not at all happy with service provided
So Received Below From ITS4woman 
Hello Caroline I have issued duplicate documents to your address on your policy free of charge on this occasion Please note if you require any further duplicates to be issued there will be a 20 fee
They advise I will be charged for something I have not received if my documents are to be issued again It would great if I had received them in the first place
Delivery man did not confirm that the recipient of the flowers actually worked at the place they were delivered I spent over a hundred dollars and the flowers didnt to where they needed to be Needless to say I am disappointed and the person I sent them to never got them
Ordered on 211 Received a notice 2 days later that they were not and delays were typically 57 days I contacted Opticontacts 7 days 220 later to inquire the status and they did reply Sometimes were forced to wait for a certain prescription were just as unhappy about these delays as you are We could say the manufacturer doesnt like certain brands being discounted on the internet so they limit the distribution and it takes longer and theres nothing we can do
What you really CAN do is have your site state that product is not in stock when the customer places the order
Again I did receive communication that my order was shipped on 223 With a 57 day time frame You COULD have overnighted at that point
Opticontacts does offer a discounted price however they tack on a processing fee
Shte service argumentative
Came in on Wednesday with husband looking for reclining section Spoke with manager advised to speak with one of the reps Was interested in layaway for about 2 month The y do layaway Advised we would come back Friday to start it Came in to speak with the rep she was busy but got to me She mentioned financing and how I can get my furniture now and can pay it off I told her I didnt like the financing part But it same as 90 day cash and we will be paying off in 2 months anyway Sounded great I got set up to apply to progressive but got denied because they cant verify my bank account I use a credit union I ended up doing the layaway and was advised I can still do 90 days Took me about a week to deal with Progressive but they finally verified my bank account I was excited so I called the store to let them know and they should have received a message The rep wasnt available so another person answered and helped He stated I only got approved for 750 Im clueless and wasnt even informed that they approve for a certain amount at all He said they can increase the amount but only by 10 What The furniture balance was 1500 Anyway long story short I didnt get furniture because we was not fully informed of the process We are thinking about pulling out layaway and going somewhere else We could have just bought each piece Smh disappointed
I did preview but when I got the checks they are missing the lines to write the date amount etc I have ordered from this company before and it was fine
Recently I bought salomon 177 cm skis paid for them via paypal got confirmation email about shipping details and after 3 days they canceled my order returned money to my paypal with information that they are not able to ship skis within EU because they are too long 177 cm  and their shipping company DHL or UPS are not able deliver such long item
never heard such excuse from eshop I bought several times skis or bicykles or bigger items without any problem from US EU shops but never ever heard that skis are too long to ship
btw in shipping conditions they declare shipping skis without any problem
cant believe it
never ever this shop

Late last year we have approached a seller on Alibabacom greatbrotherenalibabacom to inquire sampling and mass production for our business We approached them because of their Gold Supplier medal advertised on Alibabacom Long story short we received the samples 3 weeks after the promised date and the quality was like it was made by a 8yrs old child for their craft workshop We then made a complaint with Alibabacom suggesting the seller is only trying to scam our oneoff sampling payment and they never intended to work with us with the mass production so we think we at least deserve a full refund Alibaba customer service gave us this ridiculous reply saying the sampling stage is for us to review the quality and decide wether or not to go forward They obviously did not look into our case we spent 3 hours compiling all the evidence and conversation logs to prove them the seller has a serious issue of lack of response and the samples they delivered was beyond our imagination We then suspect the Alibaba customer service was on the sellers side of course they are and our payment was made through Paypalcom Hence we ended up making a dispute on Paypalcom The seller responded lightly and it took him a week to reply a message We ended up agreeing on Paypal resolution centre that he will refund us if we return the samples Yet he gave us a very vague address without company name building name and postcode in China they need postcode to identify districts and such We then asked for the address again even ask them in Chinese He did not reply as usual until the case was about to be closed he still hasnt respond to us We called him and we successfully reached him during our conversation The only thing he said was we have refunded you then hung up We believed him how stupid of us and we gave him a few days to arrange the refund We emailed him texted him contacted him again on Alibaba no reply And by that time our Paypal case has been closed due to the seller REFUSED our case This is our experience working with seller on Alibabacom I am a Chinese national myself and I am very disappointed with this multi billion company and their corruption within Please DO NOT USE Alibabacom to source I am pretty sure there are good companiesfactories out there on Alibabacom and we had worked with one prior to this bad experience We are a startup company working with that supplier made us delayed our launch for few months due to their non trustworthy behaviour To avoid this happening to your new company we understand money and time is very crucial for a startup please for gods sake DO NOT USE Alibabacom

They provided a peugeot 208 instead of vw up changed the price that was listed on the offical offer from car flexy asked for deposit of 10 000kn from my credit card event though they specified no downpayment and no credit card is needed I advise you to avoid carflexy because their offer does not guarantee anything Will be filling an official complaint
Sent back phone as per their instructions Had to send back to China not Europe where I bought it and follow a postal guide so they dont have to pay customs on it

Tracking says it has been delivered
No reply to anything
I am searching for the right job not just a job I have had the luxury of using several services and job boards for this over an extended search
But it wasnt until Zip that I started getting blatant fraudulent job emails asking for bank info Upon further research it turns out that the companies viewing my resume dont exist But now someone has my contact info What a perfect way to generate contact lists Preying upon the jobless who have to put themselves out there to get hired
As it turns out  I am one of a very large group of dissatisfied users I dont know how Zip got such a good rating on this site  or maybe I do they are all about internet marketing  but you can read the real deal at other review sites
Hi Sofia
Please refer to my previous review I need confirmation asap
Awful I made some purchases from a company called Greenhouse Sensations and was asked to provide feedback  which I did Trustpilot then decided that for some reason they didnt believe my reviews were genuine despite having been requested by the seller I wouldnt be surprised if this was some underhand tactic to create biased review scores I have lost all faith in the integrity of the information stored on Trustpilot as a result of this
Wish it was easier
The item listed was 10 higher then all huge online retailers but Groupon also added on shipping I contacted around 5 people looking fir help and received mom never got any sort of refund or even a discount or price match They were uncaring and extremely dissapointing
After 2 weeks of waiting for my product I had to contact Zodee to enquire about when I would receive the goods by post I was then told it was 12 weeks away as it wasnt in stock There was no indication it was out of stock when I purchased the goods I was offered a refund which I took as I feel a month is much to long to wait for goods purchased
10 DAS PARA RECIBIR EL PEDIDO
Customer service Groupon hasnt responded to my Tagged Facebook post or last survey rating my satisfaction with my order of expired batteries that you sold me Shame on you

Ordered a garment that was available on the website only to be called and told the next working day that there had been a stock error and the garment was not available This is not the first time this has happened to me with Lifestyle Sports  great shopping brand let down by poor stock control or bad website management Very disappointed
I bought this to be the water circuitbreaker for my vacation home where we suffered leaks before It is a great concept if only it worked well
This is a terrible product It is expensive to begin with and then I had to pay a plumber about 1000 additional to install it in the garage where the water comes into the house It worked well for a month then it simply stopped working It just stays open even if I use the controller to close it  although it makes the whirring noise to give me hope 
I didnt want to pay the plumber to remove it Since it stays open there is no harm in it staying there I resorted to closing the main valve whenever I leave the house and turn off the water heater and filter pumps to prevent a leak from ruining the house
Stay away
Was trying to get ahold of them for weeks emailing and calling because I accidentally sent them a book I rented from somewhere else Finally they emailed me back saying they no longer had the book THEY DO NOT COMMUNICATE WELL
Ordered a part that they said would fit my car and sent wrong part to me i sent it back and got nothing back not even my money been over a month
I would like to have the option between a medium and large depending on the cut It seems like there is only ever one size available once I spend time picking out an item I have no options Very difficult to shop would have purchased much more if any size options 
I was sent emails about getting Quote s

Ordered a orchid arrangement on march 13th for march 14th delivery for our daughters birthday They were delivered on the 15th in such deplorable completely dead condition that I still find it hard to believe that any company would operate in such a manner I wish I could post the pics here as visual proof for anyone contemplating ordering from this outfit They offered to resend a new arrangement at no additional cost to me theres a novel idea and when I refused because it was now 3 days after her birthday they stated in an email that because they had attempted to correct the situation and I refused that they would only refund the cost of the arrangement and not the 1395 handling fee Horrible horrible horrible company
The dress I bought did not look the same in real life Colors were weaker and more purpleish rather than a bright cobolt blue The sequins look cheap and the dress is not worth 100 dollars
I paid the premium for guaranteed delivery by 4 pm but not only was the order no there by 4 pm it was NEVER delivered I have spent several hours on the phone with several useless customer service representatives but I STILL havent received even a refund Terrible
ZOHO Mail is a very good service for the small business especially if you have the premium service  except that it isnt And thats because their customer support is poor
Yes most of us have experienced poor customer service  it is one of the hazards of life
When everything works OK But when you need a helping hand quickly it is not OK
I locked myself out of my ZOHO account after a password change Forcing me to setup a free GMail account so I could contact ZOHO support
However I have no way of knowing whether they have received my request for assistance or not  certainly my Gmail Inbox is empty
I gather that they do not work at weekends And so I have to wait until Monday for a response

The following is an update to my ZOHO review
ZOHO support have now reset my Password and I have sucessfully logged into my account
It has taken 4 days for them just to do this  well in fairness  one and a half business days They do not support their clients during weekends
If I was a business user then its safe to say I could very well be in a pickle by now
However I am only a home user but it is no less crucial that I have not just a robust Email service but the confidence in its customer support too
This is a shame because clearly ZOHO and all their bundled office applications are very fine
But poor customer support might just be their Achilles Heel and I am not sure whether I will want to stay with them if they dont provide a faster support system and at the weekends too
Even more vital it surely must be for business customers
One of my tshirt have lost
Got cheaper insurance
website promises 2 hour completion It has taken 5 Days with 2 being the weekend my Credit rating is almost as good as it can be top 15 of Australia And Everything they asked for I provided within 10 minutes of them askingemailing
The problem is now I was consolidating some loans however because its been so long the amounts have changed and I am sick of dealing with them so asking for even corrections to the loan amount will just delay things further I feel
The application process is cumbersome not intuitive the application is so vague you are told to sign documents with a link yet it just takes you to the status page
Site promises flexible payment arrangements however I couldnt nominate an account of my choosing
Instead
When you submit your bank statements there is an explicit notice saying we dont record your bank details Yet when I go to complete my Loan they magically have the BSB acct number from them
Document and ID uploading is just as frustrating with a small square that is unlabeled is the confirmupload button
I was bombarded with emails updating my loan status Yet nothing was happening calls were not made to me that should have There are better places to get loans from
I bought a pair of Jimmy Choo shoes but one sole was brokenI contacted the customer service and wanted to change another oneI was told the shoes were sold out and I could only return it I was not satisfied with that
Customer service was so bad they started taking my mileage even when I wasnt driving when contacted they said it was all good when i knew I wasnt driving that much When they noticed I was driving mire than the box was recording they took off the mileage straight away I have them mileage every 2 weeks to keep it in check
My advice to everyone wanting to book through this agency DO NOT use this agency because when problems arise and even if it is not your fault they will not compensate you they will not refund your money and they will leave you stranded It happened to me recently and spent few days calling and talking to several of their agents about my situation They listen you explain yourself over and over to each agent and then you get transfered to another agent or supervisor and the result sorry our hands are tied you need to talk someone else or you should pay 70 extra money on the top of what you paid to reschedule or full money to rebook with route change TRAVELERS DO NOT USE THIRD PARTY AGENCIES ALWAYS BOOK THROUGH AIRLINES I LEARNT ME LESSON AND WANTED TO LET YOU ALL KNOW
I am very disappointed with this website the wrong ink cartridges were mailed to me I will not order from Inkfarm again Very disappointed

Awful Flowers ordered 15 week ago They are still not delivered
They claimed some of the DVDs were not in good order so did not pay for them interestingly it was the most expensive ones Then they did not return them to me so basically they got the 3 DvDs for free
I NEVER RECIVE MY ORDER FROM 16117
We had ordered 2 Black Ink Cartridges PG645XL and coloured cartridge CL 646XL   for my Canon Printer PIXMA MG2960 not even 10 pages were printed and the cartridge stopped printing I have replaced it with the other spare cartridge not sure how long this will last this was the first time I ordered with Ink Station and im really disappointed with the quality
The rental price was fair and the manager was friendly HOWEVER I only needed the storage for around 10 days after that I cleared every thing out and notified the office Then later that month my debit card was charged 95 dollars for another month storage so I called and told the office about what had happened and they said they would have the manager call me back and that was a week ago so I filed a dispute with my bank and that can take up to 10 days all the meanwhile Im out almost a hundred bucks and Im a disabled veteran on a limited fixed income so it has really been hard on my finances so Im not happy at all
Poor customer experience
I recently ordered a Awatta airbrush kit from them and have not received it They emailed me telling me that my order would be sent directly from Awatta After a week I called Awatta directly they told me that they had received the order but could not send it due to a reason that had to be discussed directly with Chicago airbrush all I know is I have a bunch of projects to complete and do not have the tools to do them they are happy to take your money and leave you hanging  They are costing me time and money thanks a lot Chicago airbrush Your company sucks  The biggest group of liars I have ever dealt with Wish I had read some reviews on them before ordering trust me on this one if you are looking to buy any form of airbrushing supplies DO NOT deal with this company
Skip it Not worth the trouble if you want to cancel your order after finding out the delivery will take one hour to travel 19 kilometers I rang restaurant and found out I could pick it up in 10 minutes
I ordered 3 books on February 17th here it is on March 8th and I still have not received the books I ordered
I hope they go bankrupt 
I am having problems getting anyone to do what the say they are doing My name was wrong on the certificate and my lease agreement was wrong The total I was told in the beginning was not what they are trying to charge me now I paid for 6 months up front and now they say I owe them more I was told they were sending corrected copies to the service station but nothing has shown up yet I need to get this taken care of now not in a few weeks or months
total scam fake technicians fake managers specially the owner chotu  mr mustang apurv and the managers mr tarun gambhir aka rajnigandha
A lot cheaper than its rivals  but it is felt throughout One of the worst customer service experiences Ive ever had The staff are rude and unhelpful
All the titles I wanted were out of stock and youre website is useless When I searched the site under studios I found dvds that I could not find by going through the pages 95 pages I think it was Ive found better sites to order from Over 20 dvds I wanted to order were os
You must lose a lot of customers

I paid extra for the flowers to be received faster The flowers were delivered two days late FloraQueen refused to give me back the extra money I paid for fast delivery Then the flowers were not as nice as expected I will never use FloraQueen again
I had a flight cancelled for next Saturday and receive two options as alternatives
I have immediately answered to the email choosing my option
This was 10 days ago that I received an answer saying they will confirm with the airline
Until now nothing absolutely nothing has been done This is completely ridiculous what kind of company is this
My flight is in 3 days and I still dont have a confirmation after calling them many times already and sending several emails
How hard is it for a travel agency to contact an airline company and confirm a flight How incompetent can their customer service be
Just the first leg of my flight has been cancelled At least I need a confirmation that the others legs are still fine so I can book for my owe the first leg
This is unacceptable
Not good expirience with deliver should be next day as it said on web page and than u order something and u get it 3 days later
make sure you order way in advance
Huge inconvenience  and although it appears to be the USPS that makes the mistakes they for some reason cant operate well with this company Which for me makes it not worth ordering from since shipments have to happen twice 
Mate couldnt hire car which he was paying for then I had to pay for it which then I had no money for my holiday
n the case that everything works fine of course customers are satisfied but what happens if UPS has to much to do and you just booked the standard delivery Well it is really easy you dont receive the product but you are the responsable person who needs to pay afterwards the duty
Y estn diciendo que la entrega y la devolucin est gratis Mentira vas a pagar las tasas
Further more they expect you to be home all day And even if you talked to the customer service to reschedule for another day and you going to tell that you just home at the evening they dont care they will come the same day during the morning So why do we have actually customer service if UPS afterwards does what it wants doesnt matter because if everything goes wrong dont worry you are going to pay and dont worry the payment you need to make wont be cheap And regarding them they did fullfill their duty and tryed to deliver three times so easy In my case I bought two carpets I called various times before to UPS and paid allready like 20 bugs for being just in line and just to lisen to cheap excuses Delivery day was the 4th of january but I dindt received the goods and I dindt received also a call neither did I received a note in my mail box But dont worry if UPS fails you going to pay afterwards 44 because it is your fault that you cant be at home all day long 3 days in a row and your are working
So better make sure that you have in busy times 3 days free because if UPS cant make it you going to pay a lot for nothing
Awful experience I sent in 13 books and they told me that 12 were faulty I still havent gotten those books returned to me and now all I have to show for 13 textbooks is a check for 314
Prices are good shipping time is good BUT after choosing this company from their website ad for 20 off and free shipping I didnt get either one at checkout They did correct it later with no apology and were very abrupt boarding rude in their response Too bad because one bad experience can turn away customers like me
I have experienced an unpleasant situation I was informed by Tripsta that I would be entitled to a refund after the airline Air Europa has made several changes to my flights However my refund was denied once they do not consider the changes significant nobody has explained to me what a significant change means and since then it has become a nightmare to contact the company because they take decades to respond the emails Also the telephone line is always busy Now when I finally managed to contact Tripsta they send me to Air Europa And when I talk to Air Europa they say I need to contact Tripsta That is one passes the buck to the other and no one solves my problem In summary I do not recommend the service of these companies

the security box where you put your code in is shaky very shaky like it feels like if you press it too hard its going to fall over and break the gate stays open too long the nighttime there is absolutely no lighting at all pit black I felt like I was going to be attacked at any moment If this problem is not fixed you have a potential law from anyone hurt on your growns
I told them that I filled the coolant and after a few weeks a coolang warning came on my cluster So I requested to check for a coolant leak They havent done that just toped up again After a few days warning light again and now the car is booked again to the service but nobody shown up to pick up the car and no one is answering on the phone
These people are a jokeUse extreme caution in dealing with themThey will either not send or it will be months before you see anythingThere is no correspondence with the customer

Spice Drops were as hard as rocks must have been last years batch
When I first attempted to purchase I was told I couldnt because their online store was closed because of a holiday but the information as to when the store would be open wasnt accurate and then I attempted 3 times to complete the transaction and it never proceeded to the finalization step so I had to wait until today to retry and was concerned the gift wouldnt arrive on time to finally get it to go through I have an 18 month old and not enough free time to deal with a delayed purchasing experience

We rented your car today for a short trip Didnt mark each scratch since NEVER EVER was a car company so nasty about checking We just marked big visible scratches we could see in the DARK parking lot No colleague of yours came to assist When I mentioned that the car has lots of scratches your colleague at the desk just insisted me to sign it
When we returned the car your colleagues checked it under bright light marking every piece of crap that we didnt even consider scratch just dirt  wasnt possible to see in the parking lot We were charged 940 euros for the damage It feels like a big scam to me since there was no assistance when we had to mark the guy was very very thorough and also your computer miraculously had only those marks registered that I showed

Aggressive SPAMMERS Never heard of them never shopped with them and surely DID NOT subscribe to that crap from them
I ordered 6 berry plants last fall and everything went well  plants all grew nicely Decided to order 3 more blackberry plants this spring They never grew and are clearly not going to grow I contacted Willis Orchards for replacements and they began by making me prove the plants were dead by sending photos  checking roots for growth  which I did  and then they STILL insisted that the plants would grow They wont They are dead The guy emailing with me insisted that it is too early to see growth despite the fact that photos of the original plants I ordered clearly show they are in full growth mode I kept pointing out that I live in Phoenix and that we havent had a frost in 3 months and that everything here is either growing or is dead by now Those plants are DEAD They have now stopped emailing with me and have apparently chosen to hope Ill go away I will go away but Ill never ever order from them again I will go back to places like Stark Bros  Logees where customer service is as it advertises
Great salesman in curt  Helpful an informative
Tried to book a flight through Momondo who sent me to Bravofly for the second time  The first time they charged my account and never sent me the flight itineraryconfirmation so I had to go through my bank to get the money back Just tried to book another flight and got an email that I need to wait for a confirmation I am now just 100 sure the same has happened with this unprofessional company How is it even possible that they still excist Better to pay extra and get your tickets somewhere else
Edit
Enquiry solved fast through Facebook thank you very much Jenny
Just hope this can be changed in the future so issues can be solved without having to post a negative review first as my first time experiencing this without posting a review nothing happened in a week until my bank claimed the money back
We placed an order and did not receive it until 17 day later I called customer service to find out when we might be getting our order and the lady said soon and that they had run out Seriously Im NOT impressed No apology or anything
I emailed them fb messaged them wrote a fb post and even called but they never responded I want to cancel my subscription but there is NO WAY to contact them It really seems like they just want to charge you so they purposely dont pick up or answer
Tried changing my flight but travelgenio wanted nothing to do with it Very poor company support
Theres lots of ways the site ropes you into not canceling and to only using your credits for the pricier items and the more expensive items didnt have great quality I was very disappointed that I tried to shop the semi annual sale and buy a few sale items but also use my credits towards the mandatory 4995 items and it wouldnt let me I had to either apply the promotional price OR use my member credits I guess I would have had to do 2 separate orders one all sale items and one regular priced items with my credits and then probably would had to pay shipping since it would be two orders Theres no reason to make it that difficult for the customer
Received one shoe a size bigger than the other Ive been trying to receive a return label to send these back for months and no one responds back to my photos
Homestay are a real disappointment There is no such thing as a confirmed booking Even when you have paid the deposit the booking is not confirmed they will cancel at anytime Do not trust these people
No goods received
Really bad and useless customer service
I cancelled 2 times my account unsubscribed many times they confirmed my account was cancelled and no more SPAM
I got SPAM EVERY WEEK FROM THEM
Really annoying unprofessional
Never use this service again
I ordered stuff for 150 pounds had the items shipped to Norway It took almost two weeks before the delivery arrived I had already spent 17 pounds for having it delivered here When I went to the post office to collect my order I had to pay further 48 pounds to get the package When I called costumer service a rude lady told me they do put it on the page that the IVA was not included well they do not All in all you might as well buy the stuff from other websites it ends up as expensive on this site as on the others I will not be using this site again nor recommending it to anyone
They said they were using UPS NOT USPS to deliver my package Their tracking availability was non existent Even entering the tracking number on the UPS site showed no information or updates It took 1 week to get my order to my town I ordered an outerwear jacket they then transferred the order to USPS for final delivery Huh Didnt know a transfer like that could be made Nevertheless the order took way too long with no supporting tracking information to provide comfort on delivery Horrible experience
Should be called The Wiggles
Attempted an order 1 week went by contacted Wiggle turns out it was a site error and the order wasnt processed Fair enough whatever try again
Its now been mysteriously lost for about 3 weeks and is under investigation like a criminal More importantly though im still waiting on a reply for a refund
I would never place an order on this website the picture they show on the website is nothing similar to what they sent out
I wish i could upload pictures of what got delivered Such embaresement for me when the receiver received the flowers they sent me a pic It looked like 3 flowers put together
Very dissapointed
Booked tickets without using our Known Traveler numbers even though they were provided Accidentally charged someone else my mother for the tickets for my family Did not book mom and husband to even sit together Cooks was good in the past but apparently has gone downhill
Further the agent booked us with a four hour layover when there was an earlier flight that would have only been a two hour layover We had to hang around for four hours in Houston airport with a two year old Next time we will book our own flights through the airline
Booked for Full service  MOT online for Mercedes CClass initial Price 15575 for both service was good and booking process was easy so that was all good until I received a phone call on the day from Servicing Stop customer service to say vehicle passed MOT but following work needs doing which they Quote d extra approx 450
1 REMOVE  REFIT POLLEN FILTER SERVICE ADVISORY
2 RENEW BRAKE FLUID SERVICE ADVISORY
3 CHECK  RENEW ANTIFREEZE SERVICE ADVISORY
4 PERFORM FUEL TREATMENT AND ENGINE FLUSH SERVICE ADVISORY
5 REMOVE  REFIT PADS  REAR AXLE SET SERVICE ADVISORY
Really anyone with basic car knowledge will know 450 is over the top for above job
Be careful check with other places before agreeing for additional ADVISORY work remember advisory mean not compulsory
The garage staffs were very helpfulfriendly so no issue there
I purchased a deal for painting on Groupon I tried calling the business multiple times to schedule an appointment They NEVER returned my calls and I always got voicemail I paid 98 for this And nothing I contacted Groupon about the issue and they would only give me groupon bucks and not a refund Very unhelpful customer service
Also as a merchant I tried to start a campaign and it said that it was active However when I accessed my campaigns it does not show up I went on chat and they said they couldnt help me and gave me an email
So overall  not a very good experience
After your scandalous treatment without respecting my rights of refund and your very disappointing product for the money I spent I am going to deliver very bad feedback about your global service on google
I will make as well an official claim to all possible Consumer Protection agencies in order to mark my experience with you
I never had problems buying online before from websites such aliexpress everybuying ebay etc but your lack of empathy and cheating attitude let me really furious
You will hear about it soon if I will not get the 100 of my money back for this extremely poor product you have delivered to me after I spent also customs fees 38 and after waiting for your 16gb sd card as gift for all the time I had to wait for the shipping
MY ORDER NUMBER IS NO336508063

Here the link so all the worls will see the fake tracking from a PREVIOUS order and that your so called analys is STUPID and IDIOT has hell because did not see dates DO NOT MATCH and it is OBVIOUS seller is a THIEF here the link to follow the fake tracking from a PREVIOUS order NEVER deliveres and SEIZED by CUSTOMS
You can follow the fake tracking i receive on dhl website and tracking number is 2007214296
Explain to me and the world how i can possibly made an order the 22 of february and the tracking that your THIEF seller provide my order was shipped the 16 of february  SINCE WHEN it is possible to get a shipment SIX DAYS BEFORE I have MADE THE ORDER I have published my story all over the internet and everybody is saying the same thing your analyst is STUPID AS HELL and dhgate is acting has a THEFT and is NOT protecting there SELLERS
Terrible on timedelivery
My order number is US0253905010G I ordered a pair of Oakley prescription sunglasses with the darkest tint available The glasses arrived in good time and in good condition but the lens had a light tint almost clear I want to use these as Sunglasses not regular glasses and have no use for them otherwise I have been emailing and even sent pictures I have asked if they could just send me the correct lenses The responses I receive say we will contact you within 48 hour 24 hours etc Here we are 3 weeks later with no resolution
Your website and customer service are truly awful If I could give 0 stars I would Appalling Invariably when I come to print out tickets for an event my password has expired and I have a huge struggle to change it pls make sure in future that to change your password click here link actually works and for gods sake dont require the password to be changed every 10 minutes  it is ridiculous I cant print out tickets at the time that I pay and invariably when the day of the event comes I have a 1 hour fight with your website and call centre to print the tickets out Unspeakably awful website and service I use Ticketmaster only when I have absolutely no other alternative
We were contacted for a delivery and told the caller that no one would be home at our delivery time of 12 2 The delivery came anyways Called the store spoke to a manager twice two different days and the second delivery came again when no one was home The company blamed it on us even after they were told on the phone to a person a message was left and responded to the email that no one would be available at that time We needed a delivery for after 330pm The final conversation led to a ridiculous conversation that said our delivery time of 330 was considered and evening delivery of which we were NEVER offered I will never by furniture from GardnerWhite again The delivery department is very unprofessional and discourteous They should have offered the evening delivery time after being told the availability time Even the driver had harsh words with us regarding the failed deliveries Not good GardnerWhite
Before sharing this review I am a huge pvp fan I stopped for a couple of years and just wanted to see a good RBG group for Alliance again
I purchased 1 RBG on Saturday around 230pm EST I didnt receive an invite until around 8pm EST on Monday that is after me having to contact the site I was excited and ready to actually fight the Horde however the Horde never cameCrazy thing is we won an RBG because there was no opposing team
The customer service was great from the site It was awkward because not a single person spoke in the raid group and no invites were given to speak in Vent Discord Skype or Team Speak I guess if you are looking for boring wins with no action then buy runs In the end I feel like they are not earning my funds just a way of cheating somehow I am fine with running my main with pugs and actually enjoy the action
I Honestly do Not even know Why I ever bothered to sign up with them
It was Definitely a Big Mistake
This company does Not Provide Factual Information that Makes Any Common Sense To My Credit andor Credit Reports Period
The only thing they did to ME was Constantly Send Me Out Useless Inundated Emails Informing ME of Untruths In Regards To Existing Fraud That I Already Know About on my Credit Report that is Not Even Mine and I have a VALID POLICE REPORT and LETTERS FROM LEGAL AID to back ME Up 100
Furthermore Evolution Finance Inc Wallethub would also Send Me Out Multiple Emails Telling ME That I Missed A Payment With American Express When I do NOT Owe Them A Penny And Closed My Account Back In The Year Of 2016 Due To Fraud That Was Committed Online Without My Signature Permission Authorization And I Was Also Out Of The Country When It Happened
As I had stated this company is Useless and Does Not Deserve To Be In Business since They Do Not Send Me Out The Correct And Truthful Information Pertaining To My Personal Credit andor Credit Reports
Obviously
Please NOTE After recently receiving Numerous Bogus Useless Emails From Them About the Fraudulent Transactions from American Express which I already know about since 2016 back when I had Closed My Account I Got Very Angry And Upset At Them And Demanded Them To Stop Sending Me Their Junk Emails
Well these Evolution Finance Inc Wallethub Employees Continued To Bother Me With Their Emails And Then I Had It With Them and Told Them That I Will Publish Negative Reviews About Them To Every Social Media Outlet Out There That I Work With And Told Them Off Really Good
Once I Said That Then They Decided To Close My Account And They Are So Pretentious About Everything That They Do And Say Online By Always Trying To Be Nice And Well Mannered Which Is All Fake Because They Are Too Busy Hiding Behind A Closed Wall With Just A Computer In Front Of Them
PleaseI Cant Stand Weak People Who Can Not Even Be Man Enough To Discuss Something Like This Over The Telephone or Better Yet In PersonFaceToFace
I Dare Them
However Since I Am An Executive Social Media Writer Promoter and Reviewer With Google and Many Other Social Media Websites I am NOW Publishing These Negative Reviews Along With Documents To Show How Low Class Of A Company They Are
My Advice To You Is Please Do Not Use Evolution Finance IncWallethub
Stay Away From Them
They Are A Total Waste Of Your Time And Perhaps Even Your Money
Thank you
Sincerely yours Howard Paul Shore
Angry And Extremely Upset Non Customer Of Evolution Finance Inc Wallethub

After reading all the reviews on this site Im just sitting here thinking Has the company bought people to write nice stuff about them The support in Pakistan is beyond horrible The time everything takes from the smallest thing is just outrageous Our web shop was delayed two months because they couldnt get their numbers together Many promises nothing held
Im speechless and happy its over
Rude driver started a argument called my partner stupid because of directions
I couldnt pay with my debit card instead I needed to use Klarna and I was charged 149 SEK additional
Two items sent separately and both items are missing smartbuyglasses is not been responsible for that so what am i supposed to do now I would never ever buy anything from here please give me my money back
Terrible company
takes forever to ship the contact lens out Dont buy from them
I paid for express shipping and they didnt send out the lens after 7 days Still waiting for it
I have made a lot of purchases through RC Willey I am disappointed that when I made the purchase for my table it was misleading that it ONLY meant the table and NOT the chairs or bench This is really frustrating and now the chairs and bench are OUT of STOCK I not a happy customer
I booked a room near CDG airport for one night and the day after I could see the hotel debited two times for the same thing slightly different amount due to exchange rate i guess
I contacted both bookingcom and the hotel  Nobody is answering
I will spread this bad experience with all my contacts that is the best I can do Very sad
I Will warn and Tell anybody how we were cheated by this side  Global cars in Tenerife Would NOT check out a car for us the 12 March before we plaid them 150 euro  had plaid Home in DK 3 months before WiTH fuld ensurance  but in a crowdy warm and screaming Office  We were told again and again at the contract we showed them was NOT enough and we HAD to pay another 150 euro 
NEVER ever rent you car with rental cars  if rentalcars are doing business with goldscars i Can assure you that you are going to be cheated

I sent a I phone 7 and have had nothing but trouble Ive waited over a month for my payment and still have not received They have the worst customer service I have ever come across I still have no idea whats going on Really do not use this company
Avas Flowers  At 1100 am CDT on 317 17 I ordered flowers to be delivered to a hospital in Wheat Ridge Co which is 1000 am MDT I requested and told they would be delivered the same day 3172017
When I originally ordered the flowers I was on the AVAS web site and selected a flower basket Blooming Garden Basket clearly priced at
4799 but the price originally Quote d by your agent was over 7000
She said there was a bow and large card added and a fee for arranging the flowers of over 1300 I told her to cancel the order and I would order from a reputable flowers company She twice reduced the price until I agreed to pay 5714 for the flowers to be delivered
I received notice from AVAS late on Friday 3172017 that the flowers had not delivered and later a notice that they would be redelivered but never a confirmation of delivery I called their customer service on 3182017 and they told me they could not confirm delivery and the agent hung up on me I called back and told Leo that the previous agent could not confirm delivery and hung up on me Leo told me i should call the hospital and ask the person receiving the flowers if the flowers had been delivered A very inconvenient and rude thing for me to have to do
Avas flowers are guilty of intentionally advertising the incorrect price and raising the price when orderedand not following through for their customers to verifying the delivery was made and transferring that responsibility back to their customer THE WORST FLORIST I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH DONT USE THEM Bob Pfeiffer Order  4141060
I had a pair of frames for less than 10 days and they broke I had to get new glasses from a local store so I could work I tried returning my frames and all they did was sent me another pair in 3 weeks I wanted a refund
Need to improve alot
I was charged 17915 for a room that was booked and cancelled 5 mins after it was booked the booking did not have a no cancellation no amendments on the booking I made another booking for a room at a different hotel for the same days as the one I cancelled The second hotel I booked did have a no cancellation and no amendments allowed When received my credit card statement I was charged for the cancelled booking
I have since cancelled my account with this shady group
I was excited to receive the tap cards in the mail Unfortunately I was unable to get them to work I have had a few other people attempt it as well with no luck Went through the directions multiple times and the website link is correct Overall a lot of money for a not so great product
Service unacceptable felt criminal
Flights were cheap enough Got my eticket logged on to BA site to reserve seats only 3 of 5 flights booked appeared Rung travel up to find 2 flights had been canceled They have rebooked me new flights but they left it up to me to find out they had been canceled Also im sure call centre is in India every time Ive rung Ive got someone with a heavy accent who cant understand me Think fakes names are used as when emailing these people they have very BritishCaucasian names Then when you call them the guy who answers definitely doesnt sound like a John Thompson Not actually travelled yet this is just experience so far Hope it gets better from this point
Bought a Caberg helmet from FCMotode in June last year but after a few months some external screws became rusty
I sent pictures to FCMotode but the reply was to return the helmet to Germany in order to  process a complain It would have meant being without a helmet for up to 6 weeks with no guaranty of a favorable outcome
They wereapparently unable to send me some new screws
after contacting Caberg headquarters in Italy I promptly received free of charge a full set of new screws
Have had no issue with orders in prior years but not true this time Ordered 9 Nostalgia digests  got 9 but 1 was duplicated so 1 was missing I call once  get ext to call back next day on second call ext 202 I get a beauty First says he sees a digest not even the right 1 was on order twice I say that is not true on the invoice I received with shipment He then says that is MY invoice like I printed it  doesnt agree with his When I start reading from THEIR invoice he says that is not productive More arrogance For 4 lousy dollars Id had enough  unpleasantly expressed myself then hung up
They have charged my card for the flowers but they were not derived when i came in contact with customer service they keep telling me they were but my girlfriend has not received anything I am totally reasonable person and understand if there was a mix up or something but there customer service is useless and doing nothing to help me out
Thanks to Flora Queen they made my valentines day a living hell
Do not recommend this website to anyone
They didnt issue my return flight ticket I have to buy another one they said they gonna give my refund but never happened The costumer service just lie and make excuses The worst thing I ever done was to buy from them Stay away
This is the biggest rip off ever please please please dont not book you car in with this company Ive spoken to vosa and believe they are being investigated I took my car for a service and mot with these pigs and they tried to charge me 144300 for 27834 worth of work when I asked for them to return my car at 1130 as Id paid 10634 for the original service and mot they didnt return my car until 7pm that night with petrol light on although I sent car with half a tank of fuel no doubt the same guy that replies to all the emails will reply to this email apologising for service it changes nothing DONT USE THIS COMPANY Id love to meet person in charge they would need to spend same sort of money repairing them selves disgraceful Ive added this post to Facebook and twitter so hopefully we can shut these yobs down
My wife thought that I had beenscammed

Flight from GVA to BIQ on May 28
I wish to change it to any flight on June 3 if possible
regards
J Clayton I rang up to try and modify a booking After waiting an eternity and then pushing all sorts of buttons to answer questions I got through to an acutal PERSON who then transferred me to what she called the appropriate department which meant I hung on and hung on listening to dreadful repetitive music until eventually I gave up
You pulled my review of bonmarche because they cried foul even though It was not a wrongful or a wrongfully posed question Then when I amended the review you wrote to tell me it had been published Then you emailed again to say you had pulled it again over something you didnot point out in your first email even though I did not change the point you found fault with the second time around So I amended it a second time Then you wrote to say you had published the review BUT YOU HAVENT REMOVED THE MESSAGE THAT SAYS Trustpilot reported this review It was amended so why leave that notice against it Why the dishonesty
I believe in letting my yes mean yes and my no mean no Shame you are not so honest Maybe you should amend your name to pilot Cos we clearly cant trust you Seems you like to run with the hounds and hunt with the hares boys how sad
Said they never received my cards for two separate orders Sent me a picture of one envelope stating it was empty and seal was intact 100 positive gift cards were sent totally almost 80 worth I read similar stories from others I do not trust them and would never use the company again
This is my first time using BlueSun Vacations and it will be my last We booked our vacation for June 9th 3 days ago Today we decided we wanted to upgrade our flight for 273 Which was still available and a option BlueSun would not allow us to upgrade our flight unless we canceled our trip and rebooked it losing our 900 deposit What company wouldnt allow you to upgrade to something more expensive Our rep was less then mediocre and the company is not for customer satisfaction
I have a very bad experience with
I ordered something online and I wait 2 weeks and I still dont receive
I call costumer service for 3 times all kind of apologies and promises and still nothing
Finally I asked to refund my money
Maybe its happening only to me but Im really disappointed
Overall you have good pricing and no shipping cost which is great However you way under estimated the date I would receive the products
The estimated date was 3142017 well today is 3202017 that is 6 days late If it is going to take longer let me
Me and my partner have brought two cars via carshop swindon and have had absolute nothing but trouble distress upset and now even to the point we are having financial difficultys We brought our first one in December 2016 which was OK so we thought as I needed another car to travel to Bristol for work every day we thought yes ok we will go there again o was we wrong when we went to collect the car a warning light popped up we was waiting 2 hours with our four year old son just to find out what was going on yet pick ups surely shouldnt take that long they wouldnt let us see the car was saying o were just getting it prepped eventually we got the truth out of them and they booked it in for repair as the glow plugs had gone I drove it home after the repair and parked it up  went to start it the next morning and had the worst screeching noise for under the bonnet so took it back to them and they had it a further 3 days said they fix the belt and tensions But as I went to pick it up that evening as I pulled away from the car parking space the clutch then went I couldnt believe it 3 weeks down the line still not one day use of this car we just brought and now some thing else wrong bearing in mind they told us all these were done before we brought the car so 4 weeks in to it and we had no choice but to try and take this further Even though we have asked over and over to be contacted by a manager we then had to go for another car which we was told would be the same price as the broken on which turned out to be almost 50 pound more a month 6 weeks down the line we have now got another car but looked in to it on our credit and we have all 3 outstanding still it has now effected us in not only emotional stress but now financial difficulty we still have no help and every time we try to get closure we get fobbed off or told we get a call back and never do Im so upset and wish we never came here for our cars
Ordered jewelry over a month ago and still I have not received anything and doubt I will probably wont even get refunded
No volver a utilizar ni recomendar a nadie este servicio
wrong part in bag and no one there can seem to figure out the solution and call me back  and there is no order number its an SO number
My mattress was delivered and I was left the wrong mattress pad cover that I paid 100 for after we told the delivery guy 3 times that we needed a king we were left a queen When looking at the paperwork I received a queen was what was ordered for my long bed I drive to Gardner White to get a king pad and when I explained the situation the woman just stared at me for a minute and then said we dont have those here I can mail you one and you can receive it in 35 days I explained that Lynnes was delivered and it was a real inconvenience for me to wait after spending 1200 After getting frustrated I just asked that my money be refunded for the mattress pad I was told that it would void any warranty on he bed which I was fine withI just wanted out of there When the young man that was now helping me told the manager that he repeated the same thing to me about the warranty and I told him I understood Then they both walked away and I stood there for about 5 minutes without any idea what was going on When the guy came back that was helping me he said didnt the other guy help you the manager and I said no As he looked for the manager he was no where to be found Obviously he didnt want to deal with me When he finally found him I was then told that I could get one delivered that day from a delivery truck but it could be anytime from then until 11 pm that might Not an option for me as I had already waited half of my Sunday at home for my mattress delivery Then they said they had a cover it had been returned by another customer because it had been cut by the driver but it had never been used or in a bedI could take that one and they would get one in the mail for me ASAP I agreed to this I got it home and took it out of the packages and it reeked of smoke and marijuana Needless to say I did not put this on my new bed Its unfortunate because I am getting ready to furnish a basement and a living room and opened the line of credit ther for this purpose Unfortunately I will not be back
First they advertise a low hotel fee discounted price promo After I paid online using my credit card the next screen said Your booking request was declined We assure you that you have not been charged HOWEVER YOUR PAYMENT MAY HAVE BEEN AUTHORISED
I called their  1 613 800 7505 several times but guess what nobody is answering just music
I called my credit card company and they said it was charged
Why will I book again then if its declined I will still be charged According to my bank I need to wait 75 days if I didnt get a refund to file a formal transaction dispute
Why hold the money if the booking was DECLINED Can you imagine 5 declined bookings equals 5 charges I FELT SO VIOLATED AND IM STILL ON HOLD WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO ANSWER THE PHONE
Jane was very efficient and helpful but Too much time verifying by your company I must have been on the phone 10 times with your people I could have booked this myself and saved time and aggravation
I would never go through this again
Ask for the same information on multiple screens big waste of time About to just scrap the order Showed the cost then eventually updated the cost well after entering the zip code Shipping almost the value of the order and it only weighs a few ounces
Applied as instructed does not work as claimed

Im fckinEmbarrass people might think im cheap not buying that banner when i DID fcking paid look at the fckinOrder 4100096 instead the message is with a tiny fckingCard not even a card on a fckinPiece of folded paper
Im not rich but i have enough to spend And i spent 243 on something that it supposed to be already 40 OFF
I am happy with the product I received but shipping costs were an additional 10 added to advertised cost
I wont be using Otticanet again nor will I recommend them to anyone
Pain in the as
The free financing offers are all over the advertising material but when you go to place an order the items do not qualify Kind of a bait and switch feel Just reduced my order from 3500 to 500 and skipped using the NFM card
Shoddy lot Let you open an account deposit money place bets and then lock your account because they claim they cannot verify your age online About the only company in the world that cant do that Used their Live Chat to complain and to ask for the account to be closed and my deposit to be returned as I unable to use the account unless I provide all sorts of Photographic ID I am not sending this shower photos of my passport etc
I argued that if they cannot verify my age they should NOT be allowing me to place bets Seemed too complicated for them Scammers
Booking was done money deducted but no confirmation of ticket and it being weekend no one answers their customer care number
This is the second time I am going to lose money with Bravofly and this time its a large amount People put in their hard earned money to travel once a year Its not like we book tickets only for them to get cancelled and then the airlines promising to return them in 1530 working days Not everyone has a huge amount sitting in their bank accounts to keep booking tickets until Bravofly decides to confirm them when it feels like
They have horrible customer service people on phone who do not understand what youre saying it takes you to a level of frustration where you give up on your money
I loved the online booking experience this time where everything was mentioned perfectly and I could book the baggage amount as well
But no confirmation leads to frustration to customers  and then losing them
I need my confirmation soon
I was recommended these guys from a Dutch shop owner as I was looking for a vape
I live in the UK and I asked if it would be possible to send my order within the week It arrived in just a few days
The best thing thing about these guys is that I had a bunch of questions about how to use the product and when I phoned them they were really supportive and helpful the Dutch girl I spoke to sounded super smiley and friendly
The only reason I didnt give them five stars is because I sent them an email days before I called and there was no response thats why I phoned In all fairness they did end up responding about four or five days after I emailed them but calling them up is a better plan
I wanted an arnotts voucher and allgifts came up as an option What an ordeal Even though I clicked on arnotts voucher it appears I have to go through two sales processes I still havent received the voucher Id have Benn better off buying a One for All it arrives the next day and accepted in Arnotts Its for a gift and now its too late as birthday is tomorrow and I needed to post it Ive learned from it

Tried several times and there is no support on these products
BUYER BEWARE It appears Marley Spoon subsidizes their orders by going in and reactivating your account once you have deactivated it and sending you a shipment and you are screwed either way If you reject it because you did not order it they charge you anyway So you end with nothing  no food and minus the cost of the food Nice little business huh Sad because the one time I tried it  it was pretty decent food I deactivated when I lost my job and could not afford to continue
I have never shopped fabletics and am not a big on line shopper but my teenage daughter wanted an outfit for her 17th Bday and i got the 70 off today only in my email and not until I proceeded to check out did I discover that I only got that price if I agreed to a monthly charge of 4995 BUT I could cancel at anytime This bate and switch tactic really annoys me which is why a lot of people resist on line stores I was disappointed that in order to get my kid what she fell in love with now comes with a burden of skipping shopping by the 5th of every month so I am not charged the Money I didnt want to be signed up in the first place
Upon recommendation of a friend I purchased two flashlights Prior to purchase I contacted them via email regarding a shipping charge and they communicated quickly and had great followup after the order When I received the lights I tried one light and noticed erratic behavior of the switch Didnt feel comfortable risking performance long term so returned both flashlights after notifying company Waited 6 days to receive refund website states 5 days and saw nothing so I contacted them via email without response Forced to contact credit card to contest the charges Very disappointing
I order an item from procivic and the only thing they were quick about was taking the money from my account I placed my order and gave them two days before I started asking for a shipping confirmation and I did every day for a week and they gave me the same response You should have a tracking number by the end of the day or tomorrow morning it took a week to get a shipping confirmation and now the tracking number has said for a week that only a shipping lable has been made no shipping yet terrible service through them so far
They say quick and easy We are on our second day without a response These guys want everything including your PASSWORDS for your bank account Im pretty sure thats illegal Be very wary of this company If you spend two days giving info and get nothing in return its a scam Speedy Cash helped us in less than 30 Go there instead At least they have a reputation that you can work with and do your homework and make a better decision than this company
Two weeks in a row Hello Fresh has failed to deliver my food on time It is now nearly 10pm and Im hungry They say it left their contractor at 7pm which means it has already been unrefrigerated for 21 hours When this evening will it come Who knows I guess I will just stay up all night and wait for my doorbell to ring For my trouble they are giving me a whopping 10 credit If it comes and isnt spoiled Ill likely have to supplement anyway Meat for 2 is pretty much equal to 15 childrens portions Not for an adult
Take your 10 per person to the grocery store Youll know when it arrives and youll get a full portion

I hadnt any problems with the salespeople They were very helpful However customer service act like I wasnt allowed to change my mind about a purchase I overheard them on the phone discussing my situation
They dont use VPN of your country to make their arena boost
This lead to a exclusion of arena rewards

DressLily has adorable clothes but chances are you wont ever receive them Your best bet is to purchase through PayPal who guarantees your money refunded if they rule in your favor Ive been asked to detail precise information for this review
We purchased two articles of clothing on Dec 13 2016 We received confirmation from DressLily on Dec 18 2016 Their email to us clearly states in red letters FREE SHIPPING WORLDWIDE They gave us a tracking number for China Post surface mail and stated it should take 1025 business days to arrive and that after 2448 hours the tracking information would be updated on the website
Their tracking number showed that the garments arrived in US Customs on December 25 2016 I dont know of ANY post office or shipping outfit that is open on Christmas Day I never received any other tracking numbers even after numerous attempts to contact them asking for a US tracking number Jan 10 2017 they advised customs remote locations peak shipping periodscould impact the shipping company Again the tracking number never changed from the Dec 25th arrival in to US Customs They advised us to contact our post office and that your delivery deadline will expire on Feb 19 2017 Once we receive all details above we will offer you a solution for your case
I emailed them again stating the post office had nothing and there was no change in shipping information since Dec 25th and would you PLEASE send us a US tracking number They again reminded me how delivery time may also be affected by extenuating circumstances such as extreme weather conditions national holidays and peak delivery seasonsyour order has been shipped out on 12192016 therefore your delivery deadline will expire on 2192017contact us after that date and we will offer you a solution
THEIR WEBSITE BLOCKED US My numerous contacts to them Dec 28 2016 twice Jan 9 1718 and 20 2017 twice The latter email to them advised that when we logged in to their website we were advised the code is wrong The second attempt we got a popup that said question not found and it jammed up our computer requiring us to completely log out of their page The 3rd attempt to login from their link completely closed the page again a popup box again said question not found I again explained the post office had nothing from them or for us so I asked for a refund of all monies
Another email to them and their response was After reviewing your order in detail we have found that you havent purchased any insurance during the checkout They offered if I sent them the items which I never received they offered to reimburse us 1354 as a gesture of good will
Thats when I contacted PayPals Disputes They ruled in our favor and have given us a full refund
Order was not processed for a week from when I ordered the item I had to call for them to realize it Was told it would ship within a couple of days Was informed that company is pretty large and not a 4x4 building so things may take a while Told the next day shipping would be upgraded due to inconvenience of order not being processed and still was not shipped for 3 days passed that It took my order over 2 weeks to be delivered from time of order and site says ships within 3 business days and I had expedited shipping I understand things happen but I was extremely disappointed Dont false advertise if you cant ship with the time frame listed
I was not ntified that I will need a 35000 dollers bloking my credit card so I did not have a card I offerd 35000 dollers in mony they didnt exept it so I used an alternate way to get to antwerp tahnks it is a lesson not to travel whitout a valid card Aaron
Hipsters suck
Item never arrived Asked for my money back and they just give me the run around with their feedback system They also closed off the ticket before they had fixed the issue I feel they try to wear you down so you just give up Would never use them again
I did not receive my ticket to attend the Bruce Springsteen Concert at Christchurch on 21022017
I attempted to contact you several times however I was unable to get on your site
My ticket was charged to my bank account on 29092016
The price published wasnt right The hostel want I pay more  They dont answer my claim
Ive given a one star for two reasons that although the service did eventually provide an unlocked phone a why does provider not just have one fee Ie I paid 1999 believe this was a one off payment  it wasnt  I also had to pay 2999 too  So yes thats nearly 50 to unlock Why not advertise 50 at the start I think you know why  b it was inferred that it would take up to 48hrs then an email arrived saying 26 days  I dont doubt that the provider will claim it was all in the small print many times but bottomline putting key detail like this in the small printed is totally unreasonable I shall be in touch with Citzens Advice to check my legal position
Although the Envato website is appealing and easy to navigate through it simply cannot be trusted I carelessly purchases a flipbook generator plugin for my website It was only 35 with a 2 handling fee however upon downloading I noticed it did not work at all with Google Chrome There was a visibility issue with the CSS coding which did not work with Chrome So I decided to file for a refund
I like millions of others hate asking for support on a product I know mistakes happen and bugs are inevitable but a finalized product should be ready to use without huge problems like the one I had So rather than spend hours trying to communicate with the author to try to find a solution I just thought it best to get a refund BUT instead of detailing my problems with the product I simply said that it was a mistaken purchase Sure enough the author approved my refund but alas Envato did not Envato gave me store credit instead of a refund
I then replied to their email clarifying that there WAS a problem with the plugin but they have yet to email me back Im not worried about the 37 or the time I spent trying to resolve this issue however Im just upset and disappointed that a company can run this way
So please to everyone reading this that intends to use Envato dont purchase anything unless youve done your research or can do without the money you spend
Daughter got to help sleep  has severe anxietyDidnt really help
Felt like I spent a lot of money for nothing
Its expensive to return so we are going to empty the pellets and insert filling to use as a regular blanket I wouldnt suggest even trying this product unless the price came way down Its just not worth even trying really
The key simply did not work
Ordered these on the 9th February still waiting I could have walk up to Dudley and pick these up myself Can you telephone me on 07866762434 and let know whats going on with this order otherwise I cancelled
I was charged twice even though they had no drivers available so a driver never showed Which means the whole We only charge after your ride Is an absolute lie I have tried contacting customer service and Im being told my an automatic voice operator to contact them via email instead So Ive contacted more than once to get this cleared up and of course Im not getting any help This is a sure way to lose customers
We ordered an orchid based arrangement for 30 for our sisters birthday Imagine how disappointed we were when our sister sent us the picture and not only was there no Orchid but the glass bowl was replaced by a cheap tin put and the main plant was a peace Lilly
We then contacted Prestige flowers and to our surprise they advised that they were aware that they dispatched the incorrect arrangement but didnt want to disappoint To solve this they have suggest that we return the arrangement at our sisters costs and at some stage they will refund us for the postage alternatively they will give us a 10 voucher for future use
NOTE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAM IS BASED OVERSEAS MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO AVOID AND NEVER USE THIS COMPANY
Goed Produkt leveren
it says write your opinion in one sentence but one word is enough LAZY
I bought a pair of tall boots and when I received them I noticed one of the metal pieces that hold the laces in place was completely gone Later I touched them all and put on the boots and several other pieces fell off I bought them as a first time discount but I would never spend 50 plus dollars on this site The quality is not worth it at all
I have sent 2 packages through you guys to my family in Germany and in both times when the parcels were delivered the had to pay some sort of customs tax before they could take delivery if the items What the hell The first package I sent to my family weighed about 24kg and they had to pay over 100 to accept the delivery and the latest package weighed 16kg and she had to pay 53 before she could accept delivery What the hell is this I have never hard of anybody having to pay for something that is delivered to them I want an explanation If this was something that I should have paid before I sent it then it should have been explained to me be before I sent the package I would have happily payed some sort of extra fee before I sent it I dont want my family being out of pocket if Im sending them surprise bday gifts and for them to have the surprise in the form ofI have a parcel here from Australia but you have to pay 100 for it
I recently purchased a Flowermate mini and the threading is way below the top so I cannot screw on the glass tip Therefore i cannot use this item Never used and Ive contacted POTV by email exactly whn I was suppose to which was the day it arrived I would really like a full refund or exchange would be awesome First time using yall and so far not impressed except for this email I received is the only reply Ive received so far Plz contact me
I put in an order for a Pleased As Punch bouquet for my mother that I payed 80 for and not only did it not come on the day they said it would be delivered it also was not at all what I had ordered The flowers that were eventually delivered were left on the porch out in the elements even though my mother was home and not even 14 of the size of bouquet that I had ordered online
Teleflora was less than concerned about my complaints and did not follow through with any of my requests to remedy this issue I highly discourage anyone from doing business with Teleflora
I placed an order at the end of January and by the end of February it still had not been dispatched Their excuse Item was found to be damaged in the warehouse So did they do anything to source a replacement Seemingly not as I had to chase up the order after a month and was promised someone would get in touch with the warehouse to find out what was going on I said I would wait for new stock they have refunded me instead and offered no compensation Very poor customer service
Bought a bath in good faith from the website after being attracted in the normal way by the price after lots of research on the internet
Phone call 2 days later to be told it cant be sold at that price price is actually 30 more and I was even asked did I expect them to make a loss During the call I was told there was no need to sarcastic when I voiced my concerns when I suggested that the issue was not mine but theirs Options from them were cancel or pay the difference The lack of conciliatory tone during the call was troublesome for me I accepted to cancel and the offered the chance for the Director who was referred to by the person as the boss during the call and also as the guy who said no way the chance to email me and apologise in person or I that I would feel obliged to share my experience on this website He didnt bother and had other priorities and as such exposing the severe lack of hisher consideration and utter contempt for the customer base Above is exactly what happened with no exaggeration I suggest you avoid Shower Doctor and buy from one of the many other suppliers on the internet who actually advertises their products at a price they are willing to sell at whose greed will not impact your entire bathroom refit
I was disappointed in this site I had been led to believe that all my tickets had been removed as I had sold them successfully on another site I then was very surprised to find that they were still be advertised despite me checking they had been removed I was then charged 100 admin fee for having sold the tickets already despite me emailing the company to let them know I had already sold them I tried to dispute it but eventually they took the 100 without further contact I would not use this site again
Mechanism on file cabinet indicates S103 key fits You sent me twoneither works Service was easy keys were shipped quickly No complaints there But keys dont work
I thought the issue was resolved but it wasnt I actually spent 30 minutes on the phone with customer services to get a refund and get me out of the email list Fabletics was charging me almost 50 a month to be part of their VIP program PLEASE READ SMALL PRINT I felt robbed
I payed almost 140 for just a pair of leggings and shirt I should have received 2 for 24 on the leggings I wont buy from them again SAD
This is my previous review I had an issue with an order and it got resolved I would have given a 5 star if someone had contacted me by email personally I didnt know I got credit offered to me until I got an email today with pictures it looked like the advertising for the day
The issue got resolved and Im very pleased I will continue shopping at Fabletics and refer my friends Thank you
Ordered a mascot suit for a seller with a good rating They asked for an deadline extension and told me the product would be different This is after dhgate marked the order as shipped Delivery date is long past and no response from seller OR dhgate OR the dispute process Working with VISA now to get my funds back Stay away
Update I want this to be on the record As you can see dhgate has responded to my message here  on a third party site They have not responded to me on their own platform I will keep you updated on whether or not the refund actually happens
After doing all the tests on their website and telling me that if they could unlock the iphone at the end they wrote me an email telling me that they could not because it appeared as lost On their website I was not offered this test They say that I keep the credit for when I need it but I think Ive thrown the money
Not been my first car Ive rented with them but it will be the last one
Got the car in malaga airport told the staff that drop off will be 3 hours laterstaff said no problem as they were putting there jackets on ready to leave
So here I come 3 hours later on the day and get a 43 euro invoice because returned it late
Lesson to be learnt make sure to not let staff get away and do what you asked them to do
Bought a return ticket to Vietnam this year and accidentally put the shortened name of one of the passengers on the flight ticket
Singapore airlines say we can change the name for 6595 but because we booked through travel up we have to speak to them
Spoke to the people at travel up who are charging a total of 690 to simply change the name Each ticket only cost 480 
The taste is too sweet  not strong enough of the coffee taste
I thought I couldnt find a better price elsewhere but when I received my credit card statement I realised FlightHub had hidden fees With these hidden fees the price advertised turned out matching what I found on other websites Did not appreciate their dishonest advertising
the braking surface of the brake pads I purchased is curved hence they are unuseable no doubt I will get a refund  replacement but that is not really the point items should not be shipped if they are unuseable
Never get a loan from these people I was told there was no prepayment penalties for getting a loan from On Deck turns out that if you get a loan from them and say its a 12 month loan and you only need the money for 12 months you will still pay the full interest amount so you can not pay off the note early with our incurring a full interest payment penalty
No option to enter Honors number or corporate rate code on this particular reservation Thats not acceptable
Ive place an order since one month and sent several mails tried to call and strictly no answer very bad service and I feel that Ive been roped
I ordered a Chilton repaire manual for a1997 Camaro Z28 30th anniversary edition
What they send was a generic manual for 1993to 2003 models for trans am and camarofor us and canadian models
Clearly not what i expected
Returned it
Everything is sold out It is horrible I expected a great variety and I got nothing
Overly expensive for what we got which was a bus that broke down and some accomodation with no hot water and really uncomfortable beds and were expected to tip the guide after paying a ridiculous amount of money for the tour
I was contacted by bookbyte They indicated a book I had sent them had water damage As it was 499 to return the book to me and the books value was only 1000 I let them keep the book THE PROBLEM is that I had examined the book for any damage before sending I would recommend another seller
Everything would be fine if your website actually worked Half the time I cannot click on the tabs put things in my cart or even load the outfits
bra clasp broke on first wash no response from customer service This is my last order  just to use the store credit I have built up
The confirmation page doesnt include the most important thing which is a confirmation of the actual flights booked
Arrived at hotel to find no reservation made by Amoma
Tried to call help line telephone no NO REPLY
Fortunately hotel were helpful
Would not recommend
I had my car collected by the garage the service from them was exceptional I was called by servicing stop saying that the service flagged up repairs I was Quote d over 400 for the service and repair to be then told by the garage when it was brought back that they would have charged half of that if I went directly through them They add a massive markup so if you are sure your car will need repairing do not use
I bought the Phone in the pre sale Delivery date passed by and I asked about the status I was asked at least 20 times if I want a blue one which was available I wanted a black one and waited and waited and asked and waited Finally my black phone arrived and I had to pay 60Euros at the door for customstax OK I was happy that the phone was finally here I had paied the customs insurance that coolicool offered for 40 Euro and wrote the support that I woluld like to claim the customstax The support offered me 40 Euros plus a 15 Euro cupon What kind of math is that To make a long story short after about 20 mails with the support which lead to nothing I opened a ticket with paypal and finally got my customstax back
The product I received Elephone R9 makes me really happy therefor 5 star for the product but the aftermath was for the bin therfor 1 star
I would buy again but only from the european outlet an products that are deliverable
And by the way where is the button to switch to english Coolicool asks me for my opinion and routes me to a chinese site another example of bad service sorry but way to go coolicool   
Reserved an appartment in Feriengluck in the town of Kappl for skiing in March of 2017 Upon arriving we were told no such reservation existed The owner showed us an Interhome list showing other travellers for half of the stay and no record of ours A great start
Interhome promised to sort it out and find alternate accomodation initially they arranged for us to stay for four days as the appt was available For the remainder they suggested three properties the closest a 50km drive from were we were Not acceptable in my mind however a solid solution in theirs Ultimately we found alternate accomodation on our own for the remainder and Interhome agreed to refund the unused part and pay the balance of the difference My beef with Interhome is that beyond searching their own database of appartments they did not put in much effort to find something Basically we were left on our own to find a proper solution Financially their proposals were ok
The appartment itself was perfectly fine Quite spacious Well priced Although a little far from the center of Kappl which meant ski buses that dont run as often as those in the center
No reimbursement of mail charges No payment An email over a week old that has not been responded to Is this a fake company
I decided to try them out with the free for a year option Decided I didnt need the website and tried to cancel Time after time I would email them they would reply but then their email address wouldnt accept any messages when I tried to reply back We went rounds speaking with them to cancel always brings you to a dead end making it an endless loop to try to talk to someone They are still trying to bill me SEVERAL months later Dont work with them its a scam
We ordered a takeaway during a short holiday The site gave us a selection of possible takeaways we selected one after submitting the order I had to put the address of our BB in again to double check if they were delivering All was good food was supposed to be with us in 45 mins
I rang the number supplied with my order when the food was 30 mins late The person on the phone was extremely rude telling me the driver was on his way I asked if the food would still be warm at this stage and he told me it would as he knew when the driver left I reckoned he must have left late already When the driver finally arrived quite some time later he asked for extra delivery charge as he felt we were too far out Since we are not from here there was no way we could have known this but I expect the website to ensure a good match I also expect the takeaway to ring and cancel or to ask for extra charge upfront and tell us that it will be later in such a situation I was very disappointed with the entire experience
Food was mediocre at best so it didnt make up for it in any way
The website experience was very easy toon use and I was informed that the order would be available for collection in 3 to 5 working days After one week I went into the store and unfortunately the staff member were engaged in a conversation and I was made to wait until they had finished before I was spoken too I was waiting in front of them I was then asked if I had received an emailphone call too say the item was ready for collection when I said no the reply was well its not in and I was too call back when I received confirmation that it was in After 3 weeks I had not had a callemail and contacted customer service they were really helpful and told me the item had been in the store for 2 weeks She sent me a confirmation email for me to take to the shop No apology was given
I would not recommend the collect in the shop service
20mins hold time once you become a customer but little to no wait as they acquire you w ridiculous scripts
I am using Paypal as buyer and seller Most of the time when there is a conflict Paypal is not taking real decisions and you often feel screwed
Moreover when you contact Paypal due to an issue first answe is No They really do not care about small buyers or resellers
I keep using it as seller as many people wants to buy through Paypal for Protection but if the seller want to screw you  even through Paypal it is easy Better is just to buy to shops you can trust hopefully some ebusiness still have customer care as a target
FOR THIS MOMMENT VERY BAD
I like the site its easy to navigate great in that aspect However after selecting 3 flights multiple city vacation i filled out all my info and went to confirm booking the price jumped 9000what so i thought perhaps one of my flights booked up in that time it took me to fill out the form or some other eroneous error occurred I redid everything again and still the same price jump I decided it would be good to call customer service to see what was wrong The operator was friendly and nice but couldnt answer why there was a price jump online and then could not find the same flights through his system for the same price he found something similar but one of the flights had a stop over which i said i did not want and the cost of the flights were still higher than what was originally Quote d on the website He sort of tried to rush me to book and i had to explain a few times that no thats not what i want and that i would just go book through another site I thought i would give one last chance to try and book by myself through flighthub It finally worked But i feel there was a lot of wasted time and it was quite a painful process I was close to booking through another website but it was only due to them having a slightly better price that i tried one last time
They  dont work with insurance companies so you have to buy their insurance for 75 and take a 150 deposit on your rental then supposedly get back your additional 75 I am still trying to get an answer why my original rental was 102 and ended up being 192 for a 3 day car rental they are offsite as well so they kind of have you where they want as a tourist NEVER again
You sent the wrong one I returned it as you stated you dont stock that particular one So why would you send the one you did I asked you whether you could advise where I could purchase the right one you did not really want to know I am still waiting for a refund and I am out of pocket for postage both ways Never again guys
Donate your books to the library or give away on craigslist
When you first call to get the device they treat you very nice and answer promptly DONT FALL FOR IT I unfortunately did and regret it My battery drained on a car I bought less than a year prior after a few weeks with the device The person who came to help me from AAA even stated the device was the reason to kill my battery
Then a few weeks later I went to go to work and the device was fine I was driving to work and rolling test came The device read that I was now after 4 minutes of driving at a 043 and went into a lockout I did not have a drink alcoholcoffeemouth washetc or had anything at all in those 4 minutes When I called customer service the rep stated literally a laundry list of reasons the devices could misread and I had to pay for a device to be shipped be late to work and just deal with the hassle overall The rep even after no reasoning to why it occurred had no care at all of any of these issues happening The rep made it seem as if at 815 on a Tuesday I downed a drink within 4 minutes of driving Just little respect and empathy
The worst part of having the device was going to remove it The rep took 18 minutes to answer This was after giving my three digit s from the device for a two month checkin to the one rep Separate issue that the s never worked on their site So I am transferred to a rep to handle deinstallation They didnt ask best locations times dates etc like installation The rep just stated here is where to go that day I had to explain that I could not go that same day because HELLO I am at work So I waited got a time for the next day Well given one option for a time the next day I asked for email for this places name and time for appointment and the rep stated they do not do that I asked to repeat the name of the place and the rep was very rude in quickly repeating As if myself double checking was a terrible thing to do I went and got it removed and paid about 5500 to remove Then best part I had to find a UPS to send the device back to them Had to make sure to do this promptly so to make sure that they get it the next day and not fall to close to next lease charge that is 3 days later from removal If it was not received tomorrow I ran the risk they would charge me for next month even those clearly I was not using it No prorating either Called the next day to close the account and the rep stated adminstrative fees for this was 7700 When I asked why this was not on the site FAQs for closing or every discussed the rep stated well it is in your contract and you need to read I paid this but learn my lesson They are crooks and just rude No customer service at all
SHOP AROUND AND GET ANOTHER COMPANY
Got on their website ordered tickets Web site said cant order now try later  got tickets elsewhere Then I get a email saying tickets were purchased Phone them 4 times still no joynever use them again
When I finally got thru to customer service hours later the lady was unhelpful and said they dont give refunds and that I would have to wait 72 hours for a manager to call me Ridiculous Waste of time and money First and last time Ill ever use this site
The tickets were misrepresented as floor seats and when I arrived at the venue discovered they were general admission I overpaid by 3x to 4x because of this misrepresentation I will not be purchasing from ticket city or seat geek
Dont tell customers you are short staffed Sales men leaving us while we were in the middle of purchasing multiple items items delivered far out phone customer service transferred multiple of times and on hold for over 24 minutes Needed to furnish a brand new house and will now go to a different store
Quite a few times I sent topup to a GTT phone in Guyana The amount that the recipient was suppose to receive was less than what the actually received I paid a service fee to topup the exchange rate is also lower compared to other sites that provides topup service and then they are deceptive in the transaction as well
Ibooked over one week ago and called since but still I have no voucher
I ordered a German chocolate cake The icing was so thin and none in between layers The cake was dark very dark chocolate which I have never had a dark chocolate German chocolate cake It was horrible The cake was only about 7 inches I paid 4700 for nothing
this so called insurance company should not be allowed to do business in irelandworse experience i ever had with a insurance company i could start tying why but i lost a lot time already talking to these cowboys and it doesnt matter to them anywayas i said stay away at all costs
i could not book through web site so had to book on arrival the price Quote d to me at the desk was 40 50 more  i was expecting it to be bit more and the price charge to my credit which i was not told about was extra fees of 100
i talk the guy at the counter when i get back and he said he would look into it but to this day no ever contacted me about my complaint
Products take to long to ship and there is no communication of when the product actually ships
I was asked to change my review because it was mean That it would offend the company I did so and Trustpilot published a reply from the company saying that they could not find my customer info First they were afraid that I might have offended their client than the same client cant verify that I was a customer and they published the company response
When I put in my order the screen said 36 packs I received 6
The amount of time and effort required to get a 10 gift card was unbelievable
Not wor5th the hassle
You should change your DNA results wait from 6 8 Weeks to 12  16 weeks First its bad advertisement second  all your doing is having your customers take their results and upload on someone else web site I am in to my 12th week waiting on results for family members and Ancestry has manage to destroy any chance of my family setting up an account with them In their opinion its bad advertisement and if theyre relationship is starting off bad why bother staying around
Waste of money When uploading photos online it indicated the photo quality was good The paper finishing I chose was the most expensive one too The photos in the actual product were grainy and colour was not flattering as shown in the preview on screen The expensive finishing did not flatter the product at all The product was so unpresentable it could not be used Utter disappointment
They take your money for items they dont have in stock Then they dont even have the decency to inform you that the items are not available You have to call them when only 4 of 7 items ordered arrives or when 2 of 3 items ordered arrives THEN they tell you that the items wont be available anymore MEANWHILE they have already charged you for all the items
EVEN the ones they no longer have OLDIEScom stinks I will never do business with them again Plus their shipping is slow as a snail
I ordered three school books and paid extra for expedited shipping which stated 24 days The first book arrived and had many marked up pages with pen pencil and highlights in different colors for 6105 I expected better quality for a softcover book this price
The last two books did not arrive on time and I had to send a few emails to Biblio who then contacted the vendors with no response from the vendors
I eventually received the last two books after 10 days and a few emails which is certainly not expedited shipping and no offers of reimbursement or apologies

I have an a on going problem with this company and they keep closing tickets without answering I order 2 x A3 2016 phone covers and 2x A3 glass protectors What I received was 2x A3 2015 covers and 2015 glass protectors which obviously does not fit The company so far is making it very difficult for us to contact them as they keep closing our tickets This is their mistake but I am having to do all the work here without any help from them plus they still have my money for something that I did not order and does not fit
You were good at one timebut nownot so good
You promised to mail us offer in one business day but instead you have sent us now around 7 automatic advertising mails  one feedback survey mail in 7 days Maybe you should refine your process a bit
I looked at this loan incorrectly and found its put me in a worst position than if i had of used a credit card as it strangle holds your cashflow and makes it difficult to repay lump sums to reduce repayments and interest charged I wouldnt recommend it as a business loan
My order is 21853931and I cannot find an email online I have not received my order from 8th March 2017
The initial offer that they offered me was offensive and rude Yes they did come up to the price I wanted but their initial offer was RIDICULOUS
Beware this company is not honest I booked a Mini Van with CarTrawler via dollar rent a car The dollar rent a car at the airport said they did not have a mini van  so I was stuck and they gave me a car The difference between a Mini Van and a Car is over 100 Please beware of this company You have been warned
Sale  225687 Receipt  504460  Horrible Delivery Service
My son and I came into the American Freight Furniture at 1075 Cobb Pkwy S in Marietta to purchase living room furniture
Our salesman was very good He was absolutely fantastic His customer service is superior He did an outstanding job and was very professional and patient with me
I purchased a leather living room sectional with a total price of 137588 The salesman advised they offered sameday delivery for 75 I asked him if the delivery service accepted credit cards and he said yes
A few hours later someone called me from the store and advised my furniture has been loaded onto the truck and they were en route to my house and the delivery driver himself will call me once he gets there This person told me it was cash only and he reconfirmed the price at 75
About thirty minutes later the delivery driver called me and asked me if I lived in a house or an apartment I said apartment he asked what floor did I live on I told him the second floor He then told me it would be 80 because I lived on the second floor I said ok
I work at night so I was in bed when he arrived My son came to me and said that the delivery guy was asking for his 80 I asked is he finished already My son said no he wants the money up front and hasnt moved anything in the house yet I said ok go ahead and give him the money and then I got up
The delivery guy pointed out three areas to me where he caused damage to my sectional while bringing it inside of the house He said he had a marker that could get rid of the damage I told him I will wait to see what it looks like once he is finished putting it together He then told me that he should have charged me more because the sectional had a recliner to it which is a moving part and he charges more to move furniture with moving parts He also went on to tell me that if I didnt accept the damages on the furniture he would charge me more to redelivery another sectional to my house I just listened to him because it didnt make sense for me to have to pay for damage he caused to my sectional After the delivery guy put my sectional together he left He did not say good bye he did not ask if everything was ok he just simply put the last piece together and walked out without saying anything
I am 37 years old and I have plenty of experience with purchasing things that need to be delivered to my home and this was the worse experience I have ever encountered I was told that American Freight contracts out their delivery drivers American Freight needs to get rid of this one He was rude and very unprofessional I feel like once American Freight got my money that was all they were concerned about and then left me into the hands of a very unprofessional delivery driver
I was planning on coming back to American Freight in two weeks to purchase the ottoman and a set of end tables for the living room that I saw on clearance at American Freight but because of this experience I will not be purchasing anything else again from American Freight I am going to stick with American Signature Furniture and Ashleys which I started to do because I have purchased sets with them before but I wanted to try something different
I would like a manager to call me back because I am very curious what the outcome to this complaint will be
Sale  225687 Receipt  504460  Horrible Delivery Service
Once I placed my order it took 6 weeks before it was delivered When I complained about the lateness of the shipping more than 3 weeks They lied on 2 occasions I was very disappointed with the service This was the third time I had made a purchase from Coolicool but it will be the last The second time I bought something from this site it took more than 4 months before I actually received it
Do not use Ancestrycom Ive had the same experience as others  they charged me 149 for a sixmonth membership but the charge didnt show up on my ancestrycom account until it was too late to cancel for a refund the only results Ive ever gotten on their site is about the same member of my family over and over and they never notified me that they received my DNA test but that it hadnt been activated I thought I had activated it the day I got it but apparently something went wrong They had my test for three months but never bothered to contact me but sent me tons of email advertisements for their services Their website makes it very difficult to find contact information but I finally found a phone number and sat on hold for over 20 minutes before being answered but the person wouldnt listen to me it took him 3 tries to even get my email correct and was no help  even though he looked at my account he still didnt tell me the kit wasnt activated I finally did an online search that led to a customer service email and got a reply with a link to a customer service form which I filled out and got a snotty reply to but still no refund I will never do business with them again If you want a DNA test do it somewhere else And dont pay for a membership  its worthless and dont bother with your stupid were sorry for your experience reply  I just want a refund
I will never be buying a ticket from your site again due to the behaviour of these two individuals
Jerrick  Travel Agent
Marlon  Supervisor
The reason is this
I had to cancel a ticket and Jerrick informed me of all the costs I would incur 350 or so I told him to call me back in 1 hour as I needed to find a different flight to replace that ticket with
After an hour he called me back and issued the cancellation However not one time did he mention that the refund time frame would be 6  8 weeks
I called again the next day to ask when I would receive my refund and if it was possible to apply that credit to my future ticket which i was planning on buying for a different trip one month from now I was informed by someone that it would be 6  8 weeks and asked to talk to a supervisor In comes Marlon
Marlon must have missed the customer service training module as he outright claimed that I am lying and there is no way that Jerrick would not have informed me of the 6  8 weeks While I understand that it is your policy to inform the customer I WAS NOT INFORMED
Marlon did nothing to fix the problem and just kept repeating that there is no way Jerrick would not have informed me
As such I am letting you know why I plan on never buying a ticket through your service and I hope you get a better call centre than the one in the Philippines occupied by people who clearly dont give a crap about their job or the customer
We had several issue with the second purchase Verification of payment which caused concern on the second purchase The three day delivery turned into three plus weeks

For a kid costume which costed about 200 DKK I had to pay 205 DKK tax and fees to receive it Very sad I havent checked trustpilot before making my order It was a gift for my childs birthday and I paid 100 dkk extra for express delivery Very dissapointing
I am yet to receive my purchase and it has been over a month
Very poor customer service I called to book so that I could make sure that everything was correct and answer my questions The person I was speaking with was very rude and not helpful She could not book the flights we needed nor speak good English My son and I both have the same first name and different middle names with the same initials She keep asking who was sr and who was jr and could not comprehend that we had different names because we had the same initials Spend 45 minutes on the phone and tried three sets of flights that she could not book and finally hung up Got on line and booked the trip in 5 minutes with the first set of flights that we wanted Just didnt get any questions answered hope all goes well because god knows not a damn person there can comprehend your questions much less answer them

I ordered flowers to arrive the day before Valentines Day
You couldnt deliver them  ok this can happen
You couldnt leave a card for her because there is nowhere to leave a card  ok this can happen
 you didnt let me know that you couldnt deliver them  I had to chase you Come on this is not good
Ultimately the recipient had to go to your store to collect the day AFTER Valentines Day
The good part the flowers were very fresh and lasted for ages she was delighted with them thank you But really your communication was awful
Exterior of car a little scratched
Ive ordered from Rubber Stamp Champ and have always been pleaseduntil now They printed my stamp wrong blamed me provided no proof that the error was my fault refused to admit that it might have been theirs and didnt offer a replacement The customer service rep was surprisingly condescending implying that I didnt understand PDF files which Ive worked with for years Rubber Stamp Champ is fine until something goes wrong in which case they are incredibly defensive That shocked me given how much they advertise their customer service Now that I realize the truth Ill buy stamps elsewhere

I was about to order flowers online for my sisters birthday I was drawn to Avas Flowers advertisement for Flash Sale and Free Delivery As I was about to check out the delivery was only 50 off and they were charging a 1395 service and handling fee I called to find out exactly what that fee covered and the man that answered said Proper handling of the arrangement When I told him it didnt make sense sounded like he was just trying to get his delivery fee he hung up on me The original price of the Flash Sale were inflated by 50 so the whole thing was a lie

We have hired many cars all over the world Many times in Lanzarote but we never had such a poor experience as with Goldcar
Collection was a nightmare with a long wait partly because of people having to return to the desk to complain about being given the wrong car
The attitude of the counter staff was poor with a truculent dismissive attitude when you decline their ridiculously overpriced options
On a positive note the vehicle was fine However due to the sourfaced attitudes of the counter staff we will never use Goldcar again
I asked when I ordered a mattress if it came with a boxspring I was told it did When I went to pick it up they gave me a foundation that the guy who works on the dock was stapling He was tring to get the bottom cover to adhere to the foundation frame by stapling it through the protective plastic I was upset to see the poor quality and to realize that the product had been misrepresented I talked to the manager and it only got worse She said that a foundation and a boxspring are interchangeable terms I informed her that they were two seperate things A boxspring is a box with springs in it and a foundation is just a box She told me that what i described doesnt exist even though i googled it for her and showed her on my phone Even called another big name furniture company who told me they had what I described in stock A second employee jumped in and told me that it doesnt exist as well The manager told me she manages 6 stores and that she had never heard of such a thing I told her I worked for the government and had seen incompetence promoted before While this was going on another gentleman came in and became upset because he paid for an item earlier in the day and they sold the item off the floor that had been promised to him They informed him it would take weeks to get the item he had bought Took the mattress set anyway The end of the mattress is already starting to sag at less than 2 months This happened at the store in Hagerstown MD Rude dishonest uneducated employees with an inferior product

I am shocked and utterly dissatisfied by the service I received i Called customer service as i wanted to change the address of the delivery the man said to me it is your fault that you put a faulty address  I called customer service 30 mins before i realised i wanted to change the address and they said they have already dispatched the flowers 6 days before the delivery date
I would not be using this florist again 
I ordered the DiveRite dive fins I wear a womens size 75 US shoe and the sizing chart recommended a M fin I even went on the chat with someone on the website and she asked if I was wearing booties with the fins Yes She replied definitely medium on the fin size They are way too big even with rock booties on A small would probably have been the right size
I would rate zero star if possible Merchant never fulfilled entire order I attempted to return the portion of the order they sent me and they rejected the return I have attempted to contact several times and never a return call Do your research they have many complaints with the BBB compared with their three or four reviews I wish I would have Be prepared for trouble and dissatisfaction if you elect to take the risk and deal with this Brilliance in Boynton Beach FL
when calling customer service they did not own up to a mistake they made in shipping delayed my shipping because they did not call back to confirm a shipping and delayed my shipping three days I had to cancel because of this Some of the customer service reps need to conduct themselves better

I wrote a very honest review on February 19 2017 regarding a part that was ordered and promptly returned for my dishwasher back in November 2016 that was never installed but was rejected by returns because they said it had I contacted customer service at that time as I got an email saying my return was being processed but no refund arrived and a very nice Charles told me that he would look into it  He told me that he would find out what proof they had to deem it to have been installed and would get back to me in a week with a response A quick response on this website from EasyApplianceParts acknowledged my complaint was aware that Charles was looking into it and was confident that he would respond later in the day on February 21 2017 According to my calendar it is Mar 7 2017 and no one not even Charles has called me back to tell me when I would receive my refund Here I sit out 130 for the part and another 10 for the shipping for a part that was never installed as the dishwasher had already been deemed dead Again I only opened the package to confirm the right part and it was but again was never installed Honestly after years of being a household consumer and purchasing many items online I have never seen the likes of a company that has treated me so poorly I find this totally unacceptable
Why can I taste them if the drink doesnt contain them Hmm
No vale a pena

I ordered candy for my daughters Bat Mitzvah  Gummy Lips I ordered 5 bags With shipping it was relatively expensive the product came in and point blank it looked VULGAR I called immediately and explained that the product not only looked phallic but it looked old The man I spoke with was nice and said he would get back to me I had to recontact them over the next 2 days They then said they would take back unopened candy which I had opened one bag to see if they were as disgusting out of the bag with a 20 restock fee and i would have to pay the shipping again it would have cost me more money then I was getting back VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED in the customer service I am no prude but this candy should not be sold on a forum where most likely it will go to children it was pornographic I gave it to a group of guys going on a Bachelor party as a gag gift  they thought it was pretty gross too but had a good laugh

 Acquired a vacuum cleaner
 Waited 3 weeks to have it delivered in the store
 Went to the store after 3 weeks and there was not even an ETA
 Asked my money back
 They told Yes no problem Youll get your money in 3 weeks
Blocking my money for 15 month because its fun doing it
Keep in mind that the product never arrived in my hands not even at the store The refund should be done immediately
Vandenborre you must improve the system I can get refunded in a shorter time frame when I buy abroad We live in the computer world with order numbers account numbers emails ticketing systems internal network applications with enterprise serviceoriented architecture
This refund is a national transfer I cannot accept that you need 3 weeks to acknowledge that I dont have the product when you never gave it to me and to make an automatic national transfer to my bank account
Do you really need 3 weeks Is that your standard Than you need to employ more people in the accounting department
You keep explaining Its always 3 weeks And I keep saying Its always not polite to keep money from customers with no reason
I have info of promotion code in My Gold car When I put it in while reserving the car after apply comes the information about invalid code So not working

Waited and watched a VERY long time for a book and when I found it at a great price I ordered it IMMEDIATELY Later that afternoon I get an email saying my order was CANCELLED because they never even HAD the book I was told Biblio was a TRUSTED site to buy from but I will NEVER take that chance again Now I have to wait DAYS to get my money back AND I used paypal so I will have to again wait to transfer it to my bank account from there HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE
Was told the car was top of the range when It was the base model got a baby seat which didnt have the shoulder strap cushion which irritated my son and left marks in his neck and shoulders
When I returned it I was told the baby seat was missing them because other people take them off which is a poor excuse especially when it hurts an infant they didnt care at all
I had an issue with a Groupon I purchased They would not honor it and after a few weeks of back and fourth with the merchant along with Groupon I finally got what should have been done from the start which was a refund but I got it as Groupon credit versus the charges back to my card as promised With the amount of people I spoke with at Groupon along with the many emails that went on this was clearly an experience I would never ever want to go through again I will continue to let anyone whos willing to listen about how poorly this company is ran

I was ready and excited to purchase my item even though shipping cost almost the same price as the item unfortunately I receive an additional email right after I had provided my private and payment information stating that I will be paying a little extra for my shipment I had called to ask for the reason of the additional payment because it was not stated in the billing statement but I was told because the item is being shipped from ANOTHER warehouse I have not understanding on how the shipping process is but I do not believe that I should pay for the additional shipping of the items from one warehouse to another warehouse etc

We had booked and paid a deposit for a relocation vehicle through Mighty in New Zealand We turned up on the day all excited to begin our holiday only to be told there was no record of our booking After wasting at least an hour and a half trying to contact someone from DriveNow we were told the vehicle had been cancelled weeks before but nobody from Mighty had bothered to contact myself or DriveNow This was peak tourism time in NZ  no other campervans available We had a hectic time trying to hire a car and find some accommodation the whole day was wasted and this put a huge damper on our holiday We were so disappointed Not even an apology from Mighty
Unfortunately this company does not have great service including in inclement weather Poor customer service delayed packages lost packages misplaced packages the list is at times endless I would advise against ever using purolator for anything
Not a good experience at all just got the run around after I spent over 2000 dollars
I placed an order because I needed a dress for an important event and it resulted that my order couldnt be processed and now I am without a dress
So when we move to our new home we choose BritishGas because they have this offer online
Free electricity Every Saturday or Sunday from 9am5pm with one of our new smart meter FreeTime
We move on last October and since then have been a nightmare to have this service active at our home first the system online dont realise that we are requesting service for a new home and just spend weeks without nothing happen or even a single contact from BGas side
Today I receive the visit of another Service Engineer and guess what Once again it wasnt possible to have the smart meter fitted and this time the excuse was something about the electrical device that is outside is not able to link with the home device or something like that
Now Im waiting for another call to book another day just to do this hope soon
To be honest thing very well when you need to choose this kind of service and ask for another companys as well for Quote s
Not happy in the end
Refund check sent in US Mail was mangled I could not deposit it as there was not enough of the check left I have never had this problem with any other businesses I have received hard copy check from
Ive order shoes before  they never came
We ordered and received the 12 diamond reflective glass We use it in a certified pan in our fireplace which has been using glass from Starfire for the past 4 years successfully This new diamond glass burns turns cloudy after using for only an hour Absolutely DO NOT use this with a fireit can only be used as a decoration We have sent pictures to Starfire a few days ago and are waiting to hear from them
I posted this job three days ago on ZipRecruiter So far I have received 9 resumes and only one was somewhat acceptable During the same time frame I posted a 25 ad with CraigsList and I have received dozens of resumes and I have five interviews lined up ZipRecruiter may be more appropriate in larger job markets but for Boise Idaho it doesnt seem to have the reach that CraigsList does In all fairness to ZipRecruiter I have had similar results with other large jobposting services
Ive been booking cars on the www for may years and this was by far the worst experience
The website looks OK but has lots of little errors  rejects capital letters in email addresses refers to sections with headings that dont exist eg Rental documents tab but there is no tab and no link called Rental Documents etc etc
I got caught in their excess insurance ploy  where they appear to offer excess insurance so you dont have to leave a huge deposit but actually its their own excess insurance for 10 per day and you still have to pay a deposit You can actually get this insurance from specialist companies for about 40year  YES YEAR
This was not clear until the rental voucher came through and when I tried to cancel they refused to refund the insurance premium quoting terms and conditions Well of course they wont refund as I expect too many people on reading the small print would try to cancel
Other rental companies manage to make it very clear One for example clearly says
Full Protection for complete peace of mind
At the counter the car hire company will block a deposit amount on your credit card You could lose your whole deposit if the car is damaged or stolen but as long as you have our Full Protection we will refund you Why pay more for cover at the car hire counter
CarFlexi equivalent is
Yes I want to add the Theft  Damage Excess Protection for only 115 GBP a day
Excess or Deductible is a renters financial liability that can be charged in the unlucky event of car theft or damage to the rented vehicle For peace of mind well refund any charges
And if you go to the detail they talk about deposits of 1000 Euro per day
When I spoke to the company providing the car Budget they said they never charge the full amount  the normal deposit is 100  200 Euro
Eventually after an exchange with their call centre they agreed to refund the previous booking fees if I booked with them and omitted the excess insurance At this stage I had discovered this insuring the excess with the local car rental company is always an optional extra payable at the time of rental and if paid negates any need for a deposit
The whole process which should have taken 10  15 minutes took the best part of a couple of hours
Never again

tech support was not able to solve my request
I ordered the Charming Pink Bouquet and what was delivered was quite the opposite  red orange and purple I called to express my dissatisfaction and was on hold for over 28 minutes They didnt know what went wrong and couldnt give a good explanation  no one understands anything there They offered a 20 discount for my next order and I told them there will NOT be a next order I just wanted the right ordered delivered Then they said they would deliver the correct order and pick up the order that wasnt right I told them no way The person that I had the flowers send to was recuperating from surgery and could NOT be playing their exchange game I got so disgusted I hung up I will be contacting my bank to cancel payment if possible Please do NOT order from Avas flowers
Your sakes people are rude and knowledgeable
I ordered flowers for my wife to be delivered on Valentines Day 21417 because I was traveling overseas They said the flowers would most likely be delivered on 213 or 214 and I was okay with that
On 21217 two days before Valentines Day they sent me an email claiming they could not deliver the flowers until 21517 the day AFTER Valentines Day I replied to the email because I was now overseas requesting them to make an exception in my case because my wife was home alone and pregnant It would be nice if she received the flowers ON Valentines Day
They didnt seem to care and delivered the flowers a day late anyway They still charged me the 83 but offered a 10 discount
I think they shouldnt claim reliability and customer service if theyre going to treat their customers this way
I will never use Avas Flowers again and will recommend my friends and family never use them either
I ordered a Hom Tom HT20 in November and received it 3 month later after writing many emails To top it off the phone is faulty and does not charge Coolicool is now refusing to refund or replace the item Do not deal with these people
This rentcarscom company sucks I had to cancel my reservation 3 weeks ago and have not received my refund less 5 admin fee yet and this is 02272017 Went through Paypal and that is also a joke

The MageRealm game itself I have enjoyed and loved playing for over a year The major issues I have is with GT Arcade are
1 Pulling the Development Team from the game and leaving many things unfinished
2 Various Game events such as Banisher Tarot Card Lucky Wheel and etc have been stopped in the game
3 The support for the game is barely existent
Compared to other websites this site has much more information
I ordered a phone and after MORE THAN ONE MONTH waiting they write me saying that the phone is out of stock but they could send me another model I say that I dont want that other model but a refund and they insist I take this other phone no matter what I write they told me to buy another one THIEVES

Order number is 800155130

So they ask me for the order number just to say same thing per email again that they are going to send me a different one It gets even funny how ROBBERS can those people be Amazing
Food took an hour and half to arrive Arrived cold and forgot one starter

Now Ive been trying to contact them for 3 days writing on their email calling them 0044 800 368 3866 music is playing nobodys picking up the phone
So what am I supposed to do with my flight Are you going to change my flight now or get me a new one Are you going to solve this problem
The Prowess design glasses broke in my pocket within one month of purchase The metal which they are made with is cheap flimsy and easily bent The structural integrity of both the welding and the assembly with the screws and springs was very weak
The Prowess steampunk design is definitely cool if Giant Vintage invested more into the longevity of their sunglasses I would pay 80100 for a pair
Do not buy a pair of sunglasses from this website
first your web site is down about 60 of the time it loads all scrambled second most times it takes me roughly 2 min to process payment because it crashes every other transaction multiple times most of your vendors choose a random color for the choice of a product and that immediately disqualifies that item for drop shipping as there are no choices for my customers most the people selling on your sight say 4 days handling and it usually takes 15 or more before they even ship it
the potential for you web sight it so greait its probably on its way to being bigger than aliexpress but these issues with your web site has and the standards you hold your sellers to is driving your sales into the ground like you could quadrupedal your sales on the web site with some work you asked for honesty this is why i use aliexpress over dhgate
First of all Kate Hudson said that this website was affordable and easy to shop We received at 250 gift card from Ellen and we were excited to use this website But once we started shopping we realized what a scam of a website this is First of all their inventory is very limited They are always sold out of a size Second non of the advertised promotions were applied to our checkout because we were using a gift card All i have to say is that this website has got to be one of the worst experiences Ive ever had
Terrible return policy and dont even attach a prepaid label to deduct from refund most websites offer free shipping
Also I returned items and it took 4 months for my refund to come back Will never shop on this website again
the cost of the car with unlimited mileage was very acceptable But what they fail to tell you is that your Countries insurance plane will not work and you must pay 464oo with 190000 deductible or 564oo full coverage The cost of the car for the week was a hell of a lot more than a bus I could of taken Believing the total cost of the car fooled me into taking it Next time not a chance

I purchased a balmain top in black from ssense and it was shipped to the uk When I received the parcel it was in a very cheap and poor packaging like the packages you would normally get from ebay When i opened the packagef i noticed so mang white marks on the top which was absolutely frustrating so i contacted ssense and they offered a refund but i had previous bad experiences with returning stuff to overseas and never got the refund because the packaged got lost so i said to ssense that im not paying for any return shipping and i cant return the item So the advisor offered me just 20 refund which was ridiculous for something that i cant even wear anymore because i tried so many ways to remove the stains and white patches but it doesnt go away Im extremely unhappy with the experience and wont shop from there anymore and dont even recommend ssense to anyone
Made me pay exorbitant fees for no reason
I ordered with marvinie because it said I would get 15 off the total order because it was my first time ordering with the restaurant But it never happened and I had to pay full price There was no way I could complain I replied to the email but heard nothing Ill stick to justeatie in the future
I received an email that said I wont get any money for the book that I sent in and I will actually have to pay over 5 bucks to get it back Rip off
After placing an order on Monday 13th of March 10 days ago to this day I have tracked the package online each day and every time i have done so it tells me We have your parcel and its on its way to our Dublin depot
The package has not moved for atleast 8 days and in my opinion its not good enough
I spent over 70 for the small version of the bright smiles bouquet and what was delivered didnt look anything like it It only had yellow roses and some kind of pink tulip and no purple accent flowers like the picture shows Not worth it for the price Total waste of money
The guys tried many times to get my new dresser up the stairs to many fails They shot down every advice I was trying to give them Basically got into an argument claiming they are pros I need to not question its not going to fit and must go back I knew it wouldso I let them leave it in my garage Next dayme and my buddy got it upstairs in under 5 minutesno damage to product or the walls They should learn that a lil advice is goodwe all can use it sometimes
I booked flights using the online purchase form and was held in the believe the booking had been processed correctly and I was sent relevant travel information At a later point during online checkin I realised contacting customer support that my payment had not been processed and I was never informed there was a problem and the booking status appeared as confirmed and paid I had to pay double the price of the original payment to be able to fly Travelgenio never again
Customer Service may be okay but case is awful two months in to have phone dropped may be two feet at most face side down and shattered screen kept shattered screen dropped second time last week maybe 18inches from couch to floor and phone is history Cannot enter passcode on touchscreennever protected phonehard to hear anyone on other end HORRIBLE
What can i say i never in my lfie received such bad flowers i actually went away and bought new flowers
No help at all I bought a new phone Not charging  no help at all  I will not purchase from there again
Good quality for the price but overall experience is way below competitors eg Mr Porter Packaging is cheap Orignal boxes often missing and when delivered Ssense code bar stickers on them make them unsuable Attention to details should reflect the highend positioning
The only reason Hudson Reed got a star is because I had to give one and in the end I did actually receive the product
There was no consistency in customer service people I had to phone and Quote a reference number and nobody ever seemed to know it understand where we were in the process and I would have to explain the situation over and over This didnt happen once it happened at least 6 times I was looking for spare parts and nobody seemed to be able to find them and when we finally figured it out they couldnt figure out if they had them in stock and when they figured that out they werent sure if they could ship them Every single step was excruciating
I was at home without the use of 3 showers and nobody at Hudson Reed seemed to care that their products were crap and all failed at the same time or help me with any expediency

I booked  paid for international flight with lastminutecom for me  my family in January 2017 for departure in April 2017
Middle of March 17 I rang the airline to confirm seating arrangements etc to my surprise they said my ticket got cancelledrejected First Im hearing of this Called the customer service and they said they will sort it out I had booked the ticket onward connections and hotels in January so i was pretty anxious and wanted the problem to be resolved urgently Over 2 weeks on and calling the call centre every other day did not receive one phone call from lastminute we are still missing a seat for the infant and we have just over a week to go until departure SHOCKING CUSTOMER SERVICE WONT USE LASTMINUTE AGAIN
I am s frustrated I ordered bracelets of December with names engraved in them and they sent it 3 months later After carefully explaining to them which bracelet has which engraving it was incorrect Messaged them fixed it waited 2 more months for WRONG engravings again kept messaging them for a refund and no reply they sent WRONG bracelets one more time Ive explained it in every way possible to make sense But they still dont understand the difference between an H and an M like honestly dont order from them save your time and money and find some one you can trust to give your moneys worth
to everyone concerned please do not go to the vodafone shop on o connell st ennis co clare you will be met by a very rude man who has no notion of helping anyone my mobile broadband didnt work and he literally flung the sim on the counter and walked away he is an aggressive character who takes his personal issues out on the general public very sad to be honest but it takes all typesnow i have to go back and use my old sim card and the upgrade i should have received hasnt worked but vodafone are still charging me each month for it
Had to wait over one and a half hours on hold to sort out a change of flight problem caused by Virginatlantic After 23 calls issue is still not resolved and I dont know whether to trust Opodo as we still dont have confirmation of our flights Totally unacceptable and inadequate customer service
Had to phone again today as confirmation still had not come through after about the 5th call No satisfaction whatsoever My husband called Virgin who informed him that there was a flight missing from our booking We are travelling to Tampa from Manchester with 1 stop If this was not rectified we would have been without a return flight from Tampa to Atlanta The very obliging Virgin operator contacted Opodo to inform them of their mistake and said she was holding on the line until Opodo sorted out the whole debacle She agreed that Opodo has dealt with us in an extremely horrendous manner In fact she said that Opodo had not ticketed us and we could have arrived at the airport with no flights
We at last have 3 confirmations by email but Im still worried that we could arrive at the airport with no flights
We have been loyal customers and have used Opodo on many occasions indeed we are flying to the USA in April and July having booked flights through Opodo
Im not happy about sharing my booking reference on here as Im not sure how public this is
awful site payouts take 2 months and then you get kicked off site for being too quick at taking surveys not my fault I am a fast reader
Hate that we have to phone to add a garage loan car to our insurance  that costs as well Whilst everyone appears nice on the phone they never seem able to provide the service you ask for And hate that our insurance continues to rise  despite that we have not claimed in more than 10 years  our car is growing older as well
We received the extensions and they are not real hair We have tried to get a return address and they are only sending us a automatic email that states nothing of what we are asking for We are needing our full money return as these havent been opened or used If anyone has a return addresss to ship them to please help us
Customer service with this company is not good and the hair dresser who referred us to this company is not helping and wont be getting a good review from me either When you refer someone to a product you use and then not help them when there is a issue that is a bad reflection on their customer service
Paid for express delivery within 3 working days After a week and many emails and chats they finally admit they not the postage lost my package
They backordered simply leaving out one item Back order also shipped using classic nonpriority shipment Instead of paid 3 working days delivery Ill be waiting in the range of 20 Like ordering from China just more expensive
Not satisfied
I sold my books with them they issued me a check that never came I emailed them since they dont pick up calls but they havent emailed me back until now about two months now
Horrible Worst online store ever Sent me defective shoes managed to return them BUT THEY DID NOT REFUND MY INITIAL SHIPPING FEES I paid money for this lesson Lesson learnt  NEVER BUY FROM SSENSE EVER AGAIN
After taking my money Via PayPal PCCG canceled my order and refused to deliver to my address
There reason we had to refund you money on a previous order with the wrong delivery address
This action was only discovered after 8 days had passed with no delivery arriving Then i rang to find out what was going on they told me they couldnt refund my paypal payment and they didnt even inform me they had put a discrimination mark on my account
So if they send your packages to a non existent address they alleged that Au post charges them to return the item cough cough I smell a lie so they want to charge you for return postage and 15 restocking fee
Then when paypal investigate and find in your favor PCCG blacklist you but still take your money on subsequent orders Only to keep it and not deliver or attempt to contact you I would say this business practice to be deceitful and deceptive If its not a violation of the anti discrimination act then it sure breaches a few consumer protection laws
Heating is no cheaper than before new installation  move to Energia
Also there is a residue of soot accumulating on the new boiler We never saw this before
The installers also were not Ramor but some Dublin guys
They even stood on the Dustbins to drill the wall
Their van leaked oil on to the driveway I rang both them and Energia  was assured this would be rectified I am still waiting on someone to contact me about this
I told the BER Engineer all of this today 
VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED
Bravofly is the worst company ever
I bought 9 plane tickets through them The plane was cancelled and i want my money back
Bravofly does everything possible to avoid paying the money back and now i has to use the legal system to make the refund the money for a journy the never delivered
My advise Never buy anything from them Buy your tickets directly from the airlinecompany and not from theifs and hustlers like Bravofly
Got prices from TrueCar for 2 vehicles Emailed other dealers and asked for their best price and on a Chevy Colorado got a price for 1500 less than TrueCar on a Subaru Crosstrek 900 less Bought both vehicles from those dealers Also used my work phone  when registering for TrueCar now that number gets scam calls for auto warranties and solar panals every day This was the only company I gave that  to

I work away from home and my wife has been quite ill of late so i thought i would send her some flowers I placed the order on Monday for delivery on Tuesday I received an email from Serenta stating that the flowers were in transit for delivery Some five hours later i received another email stating that there was a problem with delivery and an attempt would be made on Wednesday I then received an email stating that the flowers were delivered I rang my wife on Wednesday night and asked how the flowers were she then stated What flowers I then emailed Serenta on Thursday morning and asked where they were and they responded by supplying the information on who signed for them It then became clear that they had been delivered to the wrong address and when i finally tracked them down the flowers were dead I feel quite disappointed as i had spent 35 to cheer my wife up and failed
When my tickets came they said 27 dollars on the actual ticket so why did I pay 186 dollars
The markup and cost to ship to me was truly Outrageous  I thought I was buying tickets worth at least 56 dollars each I will never buy tickets from TicketCity again
The orders panel is outdated and not clear Customer service not easy to communicate with Promises for delivery time are up in the air
I got a helmet delivered instead of a bike I then had to email and call multiple times to rectify this problem and figure out what had happened
Worst company hands down Delivered my stuff to wrong address 3 blocks down the street more than once Never ring the bell just plop it down and off they go If the box is heavy its not getting plopped at the door either its going to be in the driveway at roadsideThats if they get it right at all I actually had an argument with them once because a 2 part shipment was a light box and a heavy box The light one arrived When I called in the woman said the heavy box was there in her office and not to worry its Friday see and no one wanted to lift heavy on Friday Someone will come Monday No lie that happened Another time the box came wet and smelling like pee Called in and they said they had a chemical spill on the truck  OK so you just deliver wet with chemical Then they backtracked and said there was an animal shipment  so it was pee Then they backtracked again
At least they named it right puroLATER
I paid a order for womens day But its March 10 now It is still not delivered I request refund in the help center And nobody response the issue I am considering legal actions

Ive purchased from online vendors many times esp Mr Porter Matchfashion etc and they are impeccably polite With the American vendors like Shopbop  East Dane be prepared for a more abrupt curt correspondence Is this an American thing If so could I politely advise that Shopbop lacks the sophistication and politeness needed to deal with overseas shoppers
In the reservation I made at home on their sitein English I clearly stated that I didnt want any extra covering
I picked up the car on feb 11 2017 in Alicante airport and signed a contractin Spanish with an amount that I thought was the deposit
It turns out it wasnt a deposit but their Super Relax Cover When I try to read the contract it says Corbertura Super and I should of cause have asked what that was but I am sure I never agreed to any extras
Contacting Gold Car has made no difference They answer polite but thats the only good thing to say about that
I have rented cars a lot of times so I am not new at it But this is the first time I have been scammed by a company Not using Gold Car again thats for sure
Tried getting ahold of them 3 times no one ever answered didnt end up sending out my product very disappointed
After waiting a week for my furniture I get to store and notice my sofa is damage but the manager of the store tried to make me feel like it was made that way or you cld just take it off He then ripped the cover even more to explode the bottom of the sofa I then ask for a new one but the manager stated it wld be another week Being that I was unsatisfied and disappointed the manager stated he wldnt put a rush on the order and the warehouse was local Then he wldnt deliver it for free he stated I had to pick it up After feeling like I was getting no where w this guy I ask for corp  he stated they dont have one and gave me a email allihomezonefurniture who NEVER replied or tried to assist to make things better I will NEVER refer or buy anything from Home Zone again
I ordered my medication on March 1st and that same day the physician sent the prescription by escript On March 6th I sent an inquiry since the tracking stated the order was processing On March 7th I received an email stating they had not received the physicians order On March 9th I contacted the physician and learned they had sent the order on March 1st I called Healthwarehouse and the agent told me they did have the physicians order but the credit card would not go through He said they use that same email for all concerns hoping the customer will call in He said they had tried to call me several times I had NOT received any calls from them While on the phone with him he cancelled the first order and ran it through again with the same credit card and it went through fine Now Im on day 10 and the order is still processing SOUNDS DISORGANIZED
When I previously made my review I did so just after I ordered I thought it was incredible value with the free delivery However I ordered my flowers for 13th a day before Valentines as I knew this would be a busy day for deliveries Unfortunately today is the 14th and my flowers did not arrive yesterday and still arent here today I emailed prestige and received an email from Darren who told me this is because I opted for the free delivery and I should of gone for the 299 24hr service I did not go for the 24hr service as I placed my order on the 5th Feb and the flowers would be dead by valentines if they arrives on the 6th The free std delivery said up to 2 working days so I selected this option as the date I requested was 8 days from my order date so thought this would leave plenty of time What is the point of asking what date you want the flowers delivered if you are not going to try to honour it They had 8 days they could have posted them 4 3 or even 2 days before to make sure they got here on time had I only ordered flowers for my wife she could of got up this morning to nothing believing I had forgot all about Valentines day leading to an argument and possibly causing damage to my marriage I am currently arguing for a refund as these were for valentines but getting no where
If you are thinking about ordering for a special occasion do not use this company you either have to pay 299 for 24 hour delivery and they will arrive too early and die before you need them or go for std and they wont arrive on time
We like to stay in a certain room and there is no opportunity to give a preference In the past with phone reservations where we asked for a certain room there is no record at the hotel this was asked The local hotel staff are always very accommodating in meeting requests but there is nothing in the reservation experience that is customer oriented
I paid for item 112216 it is now 22217 and I still have not received the part I ordered My last email was sent almost two weeks ago and has yet to be answered I did get one message left in my voicemail but never was able to actually speak to this person when I called back The part was only 60 I give up
I am waiting for a 3rd try on getting my daughters order correct First it was the wrong color then it was the wrong size I sure hope this 3rd time works
After buying the product and sending an incident no one has answered me and follows my order as sent and not received I will wait for an answer that I see will not arrive
I recently purchased a laptop I was informed it would take a few days to arrive  purchased Saturday due date following Wednesday however arriving back on Wednesday no sign  calling Thursday to find out it was on a van Friday no sign  miraculously it appeared on Friday evening  the manager had the cheek to repackage the display model  as if I would not notice  In saying that I did not complain as the service was that poor the service after complaining would be worse
Because I have been unable to find the produce locally I ordered
on line I found later like products for a much less price
Showed available units that dont even exist
Resonable pricing At the beggining thought they were ok Hard to get in contact with Not understanding about kilometers killometers going down even when car wasnt been driven They stopped recieving a signal from the box in my car told me they were going to cancel my insurance even when the fault had nothing to do with me Wouldnt go back
Restricting hours Cheap flimsy walls Doors are very short for tall items Staff has no knowledge of the premises and layout Highest prices in the area
I took my business elsewhere
I purchased a Groupon for Mr Laser for laser hair removal Before I could finish my sessions Mr Laser closed permanently with no notice I showed up to one of my appointments to find a computer printed note saying they were permanently closed I contacted Groupon Ottawa and was not given any solution whatsoever Oh and NO HAIR IS GONE

Jason delivery guy on truck 16 left a 4 inch blade in my house completely open on my couch Thank goodness my hand found it and not my daughters or the dogs Days later when he finally came to claim his knife he tried to bribe me with a 10000 bill I did not accept his bribe
I recently purchased a set of cartridges and paid for them on
7 FEB Upon receiving them I immediately opened the box and
attempted to replace one off the cartridges and at this time found
they were the wrong size The cartridges in my printer have XL on
side of them and these had XXL I have sent two E mails to Inkfarm
but have not had any response The cost was 7500 Canadian
and I purchased replacements for 5500 Cdn here in Brandon
Disappointed that I have not had any message My whole printer
cost 8500 and now have 12800 cost
I ordered a lovely looking wig from the photo on the web site When I looked at the smaller photos of the wig at different angles I noticed they had included a really crappy wig The caption at the top of the page describing the wig said it was gray But the photo I ordered from looked multi shades of grays I should have clued in but didnt When I got the wig I nearly fell over in shock I got the crappy gray wigNot what I thought I ordered There was no warning about sending the crappy wig just a big enticing photo of the one I wanted I have tried to explain things to the customer service department and they keep telling me its what I ordered send them photos and return the wig I paid enough money for it and it would cost almost as much to send it back Today they let me know they sent another order I suspect is a wig and most likely the same crappy one I found the wig I wanted on line with another more expensive company and realized they must have copied the photo of the expensive wig and put it on their site to entice me to buy it Is this not misleading and defrauding information about the product I will have no further dealings with Lightinthebox and will refuse the new package when it comes I have wasted enough time and money dealing with them

I scheduled a pick up the day before for 710720am got a conformation and a reminder in the morning They never showed up and I was an hour late for work on the worst day to be late Besides being late I stood in the freezing cold for 20min waiting for a buffoon who couldnt take 5 sec to let me know This was bull ht and Ill never use them ever again Also after emailing them to tell them what happened I got a response we are sorry you were experiencing problems with your app heres 5 credit first off a driver not showing up after conformation and reminder has nothing to do with my app its the drivers incompetence and shove your 5 where the sun doesnt shine
Terrible customer service from this company I ordered two items for my iPhone 6 one was fine but I didnt really like it the other one was perfect except it was a size for an iPhone 5 So before I sent both items back I asked the MiniInTheBox if they would refund me for sending the items back They answered that they would first need to review it so I have to send the items back first Which I did costing me 10EUR They never refunded me this money and Mauricio from their customer service team replied that I should have provided them with a photo of the wrong item Which is not what was mentioned the first time I asked And a photo Why I have sent back the items so you can find out yourselves that it was the wrong size right Anyhow after asking Mauricio these exact same questions I got a very rude reply from him not answering any of these questions just stating a refund is not possible Now a couple of angry messages later he is lying to me that the right item was sent Well I have tried a couple of times but an iPhone 6 does not fit and it even said iPhone 5 on the carton inside the item Allinall very rude customer service Dont be fooled by the cheap prices it is not worth the hassle afterwards
they take no responsibility and always blame the airlines they are required by law to issue refunds in Australia if they dont provide the service flight or hotel paid for they will lie to you and deny this
they make it extremely difficult to register a complaint in writing they force you to call so there is no written record
the phone operators lack any knowledge and arent empowered to solve the problem only pass it on to someone else they can be rude and dishonest and were to me
good luck if you cant find another agent
Ordered BMW part that was estimated to ship USPS priority on 22216 It did not ship I called and inquired as to the malfunction Their excuse was my shipping and billing address were different and they were waiting for ME to call and confirm it For crying out loud people when I check the box that this order will ship to a different address than the billing address thats confirmation I then advised them to cancel and refund my money I will reorder from a more reputable vendor
Action required Review your purchase from PhysioRoomcom
Read that and thought whats happened did my payment get returned
No they were just demanding I leave feedback
Ive ordered from SSENSE in two markets  to the US and to Europe Both times I encountered signifcant issues and delays When youre spending thousands of dollars you do not want this type of unprofessionalism I shipped a purse to my European address because I was told it could not be shipped to the US Then I watch its path through customs from Canada and it passed through the US first Then went to Europe then bounced back to US then back to Europe and I watched this happen three times Meanwhile my bag is subject to being tossed around and summer heat and who knows what other potential damage
My other order was botched as well I tried to order a pair of shoes I was leaving town Friday so thought itd be better to send to my permanent address so I asked to change the address Sales girl said this isnt possible and to instead re order shoes in a different size mine only had one pair left and that she could
Swap the sizes but not address So I ordered the second pair in a random size Then I KID YOU NOT The second pair ships And I call AGAIN and the rep said oh sorry the warehouse sent it before I could make the change So I had a pair of random shoes going to an address I was leaving in two days and the correct pair wasnt even en route Then I have to cancel the correct order and repurchase it with new shipping address I have to do this over the phone of course I give my card number and it doesnt work So I call the bank and they said they blocked it because SSENSE charged me FIVE TIMES for one pair of shoes So I had to deal with that bank mess Call SSENSE back and order the shoes After all that both pairs ended up delivered Thursday so I didnt need to change anything after all and couldve sent them to my current addressthanks a lot for that bogus ship estimate See how convoluted that is Had to spend hours on the phone sorting it too Absolutely ridiculous Yoox mytheresa farfetch netaporter ALL better options Not dealing with the incompetence and the unprofessionalism thats borderline shady It was so bad it made me question the authenticity of the items and that freaked me out even more Done and done
I was using internet explorer and twice I got to the payment verification page only to get page not found after I had confirmed the payment with my bank card reader I switched to using Google Chrome and was able to pay first time
When I placed my order they charged it to my Paypal account within 24 hours of placing the order After waiting for 40 days I followed up with them to see why my item hadnt shipped They kept asking me to wait a few more days After waiting for an additional 6 days I demanded my money back and to cancel the order They said all they can do in the short term was to credit my account with dino dollars I had no intentions of ever using that site again I said I wanted a full refund back to Paypal The person helping me said she couldnt do that It would take a minimum of 10 business days for a full refund After reading reviews from other people who agreed to that option and never got their money I decided to dispute the charge with Paypal I got an email 2 days later from Dinodirect that they wouldnt fight the charge back They also didnt consent to the dispute either So I had to wait a full 10 days for Paypal to resolve the matter I got my money back but it took a long time Dino direct is quick to charge you but theyll fight you every step of the way to get your money back

This website allowed me to order a product they knew was on back order but failed to inform me at the time of purchase They contacted me later to let me know it would be about 3 more weeks before I could expect the order This is not what I expected and is not good service
It was easy to order the flowers online I ordered them at night and they were delivered to my friend in Luxembourg the next morning I was pleased with the quick service
However I am giving two stars only because the flowers that were delivered Pink Cloud for the birth of a girl did not remotely resemble the online product image The image was of pink flowers with minimal greenery and small white flowers The flowers that were delivered were pink light purple dark purple and yellow There was also a lot of greenery
I understand that the actual product may differ from the image depending on seasonal availability  but I expected most if not all of the flowers to be pink
Very bad frame Seems to be already used one Lens is fitted out of the frame Complaint already done But no response I dont know why the heck I ordered online Complaint num  3667094
I placed an order online on Saturday for Same Day Delivery as stated in their ad As of Monday the order still had not been sent I called the company and was put on hold for several minutes while they located my order I gave them my order number at the beginning of the call They came back on the line and said that they were preparing to assign my order to a local florist They were unclear as to when my order would be processed and delivered  yet my credit card was charged immediately I asked them to cancel my order and refund my account They said this would take about 7 business days I will not do business with Avas again
I waited almost an hour at night for the car to be delivered  I had to drive 3 hours following this  not acceptable
ordered three three way switches and received two way switches The order docs stated they were three way and indeed they were not Have to send back What a pain
they lost all of my groupons in my accounts
The vehicle was clean and OK However blown and missing fuses in the cabin fuse block caused considerable inconvenience Also the feedback site shown today had not been updated to the current site
Not happy
I strongly believe that giving them one star is way too generous Not only do they charge extortionate amounts for the privilege of using them but they also as i was told on the phone do not have to process anything Well thank you very much Paypal I am so grateful that every now and then you decide to process things and then make money of our money twice as a fee and then through the interest
I have not had such a bad customer experience in quite a while The customer service representative talked over me though now after some consideration I think it was more like barking over me She did not have any information to hand and did nor seem to care at all i know i know most likely she is an underpaid call centre worker with no toilet breaks but for goodness sake seriously maybe learning something about the product would help
Another thing is this amazing idea of having business accounts linked to one person ONE BLOODY PERSON What if there are more people working for a business and be warned if you are not the person who is linked to the account you wont get any information whatsoever even if you can access the backend of their amazing platform transfer money make payments etc etc etc but on the phone conversations are reserved to just one person Interesting approach isnt it
Avoid at all cost unless you are looking to get stomach ulcers and lose your mind
I would love to order a lot of things on Dresslily but after reading all the reviews I just cannot chance it Sorry not getting suckered in LLP49494947747569
It took 17 days to deliver 1 pair of glasses n upfront information is available Got a call only once that order is delayed n the quality of the call left a lot to be desired 300 rs store credit was offered as a compensation for delay which is not acceptable You guys are expecting another purchase after such an experience that is preposerous 
Found the agent to be helpful up until the point of taking my CC and charging me for the policies Found mistakes in one policy but after many unanswered phone calls and emails I reached out directly to the insurance carrier for help Agent was only interested in closing the sale
I have not receive my order Its been a week now the address that I have put in was correct and I calledand still today I have not receive my order
I booked a city brake to Amsterdam for my boyfriends birthday My brother help me booked it as I wasnt sure what to do and as hes used this website before a few times I noticed after he booked it that the names were wrong I rang last minute and the airline straight away and they ensured me that since the tickets hasnt been sent they will change the name free of charge few weeks later I didnt receive any updated ticket information so I rang again and they assured me they had changed them A Day before I fly I went to check in at the airport and I couldnt because the names still hasnt been changed So rang last minute and was told they will ring me back they never did So rang again they promised they would phone back within two hours and still didnt bother So rang again and finally got through and they charged me 100 for something they said they would sort When I tried to explain what I had been told a few months ago they didnt even acknowledge or look into it So was forced to paid 100 otherwise I would of lost my booking
Its been almost two weeks and i havent received my tickets Icall all they say is we will call you back
Tried to choose a seat on the internet it was not possible I checked in and later wrote to the customer service online because I all ready HAD checked in they could only cahnge it the next day in the airport
Do not write that you want to give good customer service when the opposite is the case
Good experience for me they send me Blank cartridges
 Acquired a vacuum cleaner
 Waited 3 weeks to have it delivered in the store
 Went to the store after 3 weeks and there was not even an ETA
 Asked my money back
 They told Yes no problem Youll get your money in 3 weeks
Blocking my money for 15 month because its fun doing it
Keep in mind that the product never arrived in my hands not even at the store The refund should be done immediately
Vandenborre you must improve the system I can get refunded in a shorter time frame when I buy abroad We live in the computer world with order numbers account numbers emails ticketing systems internal network applications with enterprise serviceoriented architecture
This refund is a national transfer I cannot accept that you need 3 weeks to acknowledge that I dont have the product when you never gave it to me and to make an automatic national transfer to my bank account
Do you really need 3 weeks Is that your standard Than you need to employ more people in the accounting department
You keep explaining Its always 3 weeks And I keep saying Its always not polite to keep money from customers with no reason
Lite sen leverans
Couldnt readily tell if you could adjust pick up and drop off times so I had to call and make the adjustments but overall good service
Boxymo is an absolute joke They are impossible to contact and when they do contact you the people on the other line havent a clue They have cancelled my insurance now twice due to no fault of my own I have been robbed of hundreds of Euro I would highly advise nobody to get insurance with this crowd as they give nothing but hassle and will cancel your insurance if given the slightest chance
I borrowed 70k and have paid 6 months of the 12 month loan 350 every business day money always there I am only looking for 4050k now I was told I can re apply after 6 months and get better rate and more money well Ondeck is not making it easy with their regulations I bring in on average per month 2830k it can be one twoor more jobs per month they will not give me a loan because I had two jobs in a month at 35k they would rather see 5 jobs at 15k real crazy to me and very unfair so if you are planning on working with them after half your loan is complete it can be real difficult I would not recommend using OnDeck Capital because of these regulations
We need President Trump to get rid of these crazy regulations and make it better for the small business owner
I ordered flowers on 2617 for a 50th wedding anniversary to be delivered on 217 I tried to check on the 17th but there was no record of my order I called several times and found out that my order had been cancelled because they ran out of flowers However I was never informed that the order was cancelled If I had been called I could have made other arrangements Matter of fact I was billed for the flowers the day I placed the order Now I will be waiting 610 days to be reimbursed This is very poor business and I will never deal with Avas again
The chapters are mislabeled clearly states the book is not for resale its a first version preedits so who knows what was changed because most books go through several editing phases A waste of money and when something seems too good to be true it usually is Never ordering from this place again
They seem to have a good product but very poor knowledge of their own website
I needed rotors pads and hoses for a 98 Jetta so I gave them the vin number from the car in order to get the correct parts Well they sent the wrong ones Since this was for my work vehicle I couldnt wait for them to correct the order so I went to Napa and had the correct parts overnight In the meantime my neighbor need to have the brakes fixed on his 96 Passat So I thought I would trade the wrong parts for the ones to fit his car I found that his car used the same rotors pads and calipers has mine So I gave them the vin off of his car along with the measurement of the rotors and all the vw part number that we could read I even sent pictures of the parts I was told they could not find the correct parts from my information
At this point they agreed to refund my money upon return of the wrong parts which we did
In the meantime I sat down with all the information I had given them and found they had the correct parts for both cars the whole time So I ordered the parts to fit the Passat and the correct parts arrived The key was finding they had measurements listed for their cheapest rotors After that I was able to get the correct number for their premium grade stock replacement rotors
I was shocked that they couldnt figure this out since it is their website
While it took A fair amount of time for me to figure this out and they did refund my money without a restocking fee I still had to spend close to 5000 to send the wrong parts back And it was not my fault
Purchasing a fitbit with Groupon is a pain in the bottom I live in a location that only has USPS delivery to a PO Box They would not accept that as a proper address THIS is the ONLY org that has ever given me this much trouble about it No explanation is given I order stuff online all the time Groupon cant get right
Dress did not look like picture at all Different pattern Dress color was nude but it looked peach Dress looked like a 50 dress not 200

The worst thing the Norwegian company have ever done is selling out to the Chinese one company Ive mentioned in a previous review of another of their products Qihoo who are very likely state owned or at the very least spied on by the Chinese government I am looking for another browser but finding it difficult as Firefox has become a joke I darent go anywhere near Google Chrome and I just dont like Microsoft Edge Not many choices left or at least ones as good as Opera once was Sad
I took the trip pod out of the box began to roll the lever and snap the lever broke I barely put pressure on it The camera came just in time for my trip to Nicaragua The tripod broke right before I left I was very sad

Didnt realise the takeaway was closed yet it still allowed me to order and also charged me The order arrived the next day after sorting it out with the actual takeaway Then I realised I was charged for something that isnt even listed on the menu once again the takeaway sorted it out for me I wont be back to this website
The dress did not fit and it had a hole in the mess need to return
If you enjoy uploading your pictures numerous times and taking 20 minutes per listing you might like selling on Ruby Lane Their picture uploading software is as antiquated as some of the items on their site Extremely frustrating especially considering the high cost of listing Poor seller experience Coming from a long time seller who has been on the site since the beginning

I had my car serviced  MOT through Servicing Stop Quote d nice 60 discount 112 however on the day of the MOT the team called in with additional work of Quote for 713 On getting a call from the servicing stop we have been told that the invoice will be issued and once agreed and paid the work will start Looking at the additional work including some advisory I immediately informed the servicing stop to PUT ON HOLD until i confirm  on checking with other reputed garage for the similar work I was Quote d 200 cheaper so immediately phoned back and informed Servicing stop just to do the full services and not to carry out any MOT work Later the servicing stop phoned me that the Garage has already started some work  WITHOUT MY PRIOR APPROVAL and despite putting all extra work on HOLD Complete Rip off please please avoid and do not recommend
Over the past several months I have noticed more and more frequently that the discounted percentage listed on Gift Card Granny is not available when I click the link to go to that site to buy it Rather the actual discount is much less  frequently half of the GCG figure I concluded that it is not a matter of outdated information because the actual discount has NEVER been higher If I can no longer trust the information on GCG I will abandon it altogether While I dont want to leave GCG it is not that much more difficult to create a subfolder in my bookmarks and visit each site independently I can then be assured of both availability and the exact discount I am to receive

I hate this device in my car its no different from driving and being on your cell phone when you have to blow in it while youre driving and while youre in the cell phone talking thats the ticket I see no difference I hate this device Its too hard to blow into for as long as it needs to be blown into need to come up with the better device It takes too much time to blow into this thing especially when you dont know how to do it
The website itself is easy to use and I was able to find what I wanted to order when I went to check out it was a nightmare I entered in a credit card and consistently got an error message I checked and double checked my card  and expiration date It took me 10 tries on 2 different computers to get my order through I am hoping that it will not be a repeat experience on my first order as a VIP if so I will cancel
Zu kompliziert
asked for payment schedule 5 times
Bought the new UMI Z well before Chinese new year started and was told Id have to wait until after Chinese new year Phone was then shipped 5 days after stated time and arrived with a sound issue All setting are on and on high but when people ring text or email me all I get is vibrate Only thing that fixes it is a factory reset and that only works for a couple of days then you have to do it again
There support email and customer services ignore any correspondence so will now go to my card company and get a refund Dont buy Chinese goods if your from UK Rip off
This has been the Worst customer service ever Emails took longer than 24 hours to respond there was NO 0800 number to ring and they could not respond adequately via chat message I missed out on getting my prescription sunglasses in time for my holiday  One pair was discontinued then the next pair that they suggested on fast shipping they totally missed seeing I needed them in prescription lenses and after a long email wait suggested they may not be able now to supply Whole process took 2 weeks  However when I asked for refund they literally emailed back within the hour  Do not order from these folks
Bad photos were chopped off part of head or hands are missing which are in original digital copy Poor quality No one even checked

They were very helpful and friendly They pulled dresses that I liked and ones that were in my wishlist
never recieved the product reached out to them and they told me they would contact me within 3 weeks about it and now its been 3 weeks and i havent heard back I thought they were supposed to be professional
When I bought these shoes it said they could not be returned I ordered my correct size which is a size 37 However the SSense listing for the shoes showed the French sizes converted to Italian sizes and SSense sent me a size 38 I can see from the listing that SSense believed a size 38 was a French 38 which they thought would fit like a size 37EU It doesnt I received a size 38EU and the shoes are too big
I had just moved to a new city at the time I received these and didnt realize SSense had sent me the wrong size until a few weeks later so it was too late to exchange them for the correct size assuming SSense would have agreed to do so
I took photos showing that the shoes I received from SSense are about 12 longer than all of my size 37EU shoes
I am going to be very leery about ordering from SSense in the future and will definitely no longer order Final Sale items
Not happy Taking longer than Quote d and costing more than Quote d Almost double on both They Quote d me 23 hours I am told 5 now And I was Quote d 75 and now I am told 140 Rediculous

Not like the website photo AT ALL Poorly presented card was a standard delivery card you get for free stapled onto it  not the card I paid extra for And who ever wrote the card has notrocious hand writing and should be sacked
I upgraded flowers to a premium size which were much smaller than the standard size you have advertised You gave me a measly part refund with a 25 off code for my next orderI will not be using you ever again so your 25 off code means nothing to me
If anyone is contemplating using this company think again other wise be prepared to be dissapointed I had no choice but to give this company a 1 star rating only because I had to in order to post this review Steer clear people buy elsewhere
Cant review as order still not here
They took over 10 days just to respond to my initial warranty claim Plus not AUS version of the product and they are based in HK
recommend to pay a bit more and get aus warranty and be able to return the product in to a store
When they rate a book ACCEPTABLEit really means VERY POOOOR condition  Ive gotten a few bks rated that and I was almost afraid to touch them
Waist of 200 meat balls dry pasta was like eating rubber rice was dry I had to throw it all out wont be buying that product again

I have been ordering my contact from OptiContacts for many years because they usually have the best price on my particular brand The last 2 times I have placed a reorder they have sent me an email AFTER they have charged my account telling me the order would be delayed 710 working days due to my contacts being out of stock Normally this would not be an issue but the last time I placed an order I was down to my last pair of lenses and needed to receive the reorder as soon as possible I called Customer Service for an update and asked why customers werent told about lenses being out of stock BEFORE the order was submitted and their account charged The guy I spoke to just kept repeating the same thing over and over again and offered no answers or resolution Possibly the issue is that he didnt speak English very well and was reading from a script I asked to be transferred to a supervisor who might be able to offer some assistance The woman I spoke to pretty much just repeated what he had told me but she did offer to upgrade my shipment whenif the lenses were in stock to 2day shipping I will be shopping elsewhere for my contacts in the future
ETA Funny how after all the years of ordering the suddenly do not stock my particular brand of contacts All the more reason to shop elsewhere in the future
The service is very bad
I sold a dinner set on eBay and although I stated collection only the buyer arranged her own courier service some of the items arrived damaged so she put a claim in with eBay they told her its her own responsibility as I had stated collection only and her case was closed She then took it to PayPal and thats when the trouble started I gave them every bit of information required and even told them I had cctv footage of the courier mishandling the item but was told they couldnt accept it she returned less than half the items  but kept the ones that was not broken so all I got back was a box of broken items PayPal was not interested in this so they gave her a full refund and wasnt bothered about the fact she kept most of the items leaving me with nothing re sellable lost all my items and they charged me 9999 for the privilege NEVER again am I using there so called services they will only rip you off in the end
we booked 6 tickets to Athens Your representative told us that they were booked and then he called to say that the price had gone up by 4000 per ticket He said he could not get the tickets This cause a very bad customer service This is not good business
P S first he told me the amount was in Canadian money then he charged us in US money I had to call to make the change No good
Disappointed in the quality of the blanket The fabric did not seem to be a of a high quality material Upon receiving the blanket I opened it and was greeted by a cloud of chalkshouldnt the chalk have been cleaned before sending it to a customer The batting contained in certain squares is lumpy and not all of the squares had the batting in them Certainly not worth the 28100 for it REALLY DISAPPOINTED
I uasually write reviews on tripadviser but after visiting a shop and buying lovely things where they did a price match I decided to give them a good review on trust pilot however my review has been removed for no good reason
Bought their program Sent me a key in email that did not work Called their number person that answer tried to sell me other service which i did not wont finely enter key then soft ware seem to work but was always putting up message trying to sell addition to the program in a short time the key stopped working I sent them a e mail which they did not answer Removed there programs from my computer which was not easy see how they were always running in the back ground This is a big rip off
I ordered flowers that should have been delivered on the 07032017 before 2 pm which is not the case and I can not reach the customer service The order was placed 3 days before It seems inadmissible that the delivery commitment of FloraQueen is not kept while I also asked the person to stay at home No call and no passing notice
Considering the price of the service 64  your service is deplorable Thank you for counting on you to mark an important moment and ultimately disappoint the person Thanks to FloraQueen for having me miss a way to mark 8 years of common life
It was answered by email that they will TRY to deliver the flowers on 8032017 I said try No financial compensation envisaged You are the perfect example of these pseudo respectful companies that rip off customers without remorse
In conclusion 
 No respect for the customer
 No compliance with the delivery date
 Abusive price considering the service
 Phantom Phone Platform After 5 minutes without answer you are hung up in the nose
 You can count on them not to deliver the flowers on time
 You can go through them to send flowers to people you do not like
I didn receive my phone
Rude customer service Overall POOR service Would not even try and help you If this wasnt an urgent flight I wouldnt book here
The first day I rented the staff informed me that the lights would be fixed the same day I didnt move my belongings until a few days later and the lights were still out The day I moved my things in I called at least three times to inform them that I was on my may like I was informed to do so that the lock could be moved from my unit I called until I actually pulled into the lot with no answer I walk in and the manager is there on her cell phone Nevertheless once we started to move my things in the elevator was broke and we got stuck a number of time Moving can be stressful enough but to have to store your belongings under these conditions are worse The lights still arent fixed a week later
Need to learn how to put the service into customer service
38 per ticket for a service fee Never again
I would stay away They changed the dates of a reservation because the dates that I requested werent available and then wouldnt refund or give me a credit for another date Very shady and unacceptable
I ordered a pair of prescription sunglasses with the same prescription as an existing pair of glasses When I received the sunglasses I could not wear the sunglasses as I got dizzy instantly due to distortion in the lenses I tried a few times in case I needed to get used to the prescription but this should not have been necessary as I comfortably wear glasses with the same prescription on a daily basis I called the Vision Direct 1800 number and I was told that I had to take the brand new sunglasses to an optometrist to be tested at my cost This report was then to be sent to Vision Direct before they would decide if they would do anything to address the issue
Ordered light tubes covers Was over 2000 worth of product Calls back telling me they need bank statements etc No thanks Went to 1000bulbscom and got the same product for 1000 cheaper Never going through you guys again

As we arrived we were offered some strange rules
No cooking allowed in the kitchen by students at any time or in your rooms or outside
For breakfast only a bowl of cereal with milk OR two slices of toast with milk allowed
Use of the bathroom only 15min that includes all bathroom work
For use WiFi and washing clothes once a week there is a charge of 1 per day
Clothes are washed by one stay family only No touching of the washing machine any time
Each student must buy his own toilet paper
This are some rules which flashed us
If you want to be mobile you need to rent a car and youre staying in the basement
Otherwise the host was friendly Maybe a bit loud and talks much  he was friendly all the time I think hes not accustomed having other guests as students The heading sentence is You have come here firstly to learn English and secondly to have fun and learn about new cultures
I believe one notice this also in their behaviour
Somehow I have not received several books I bought worth over 10000 What happened
I ordered a case off of this website in November They sent the completely wrong case in the mail It has now been four months and I am STILL in the most ridiculous email chain trying to receive my product
Any email to the company is responded with an email that they are experiencing a higher than normal amount of emails and that they will email you back in 34 days I have received this email EVERY single time i have emailed them Evidently they need to hire more staff
IF they reply to an email it is only to say that they apologize and are working on it to only leave me in silence and for me to reach out again
I highly recommend you save your money  purchase your cases somewhere else
man on phone didnt seem to know what he was doing and tried to get me off of the phone as soon as he could in the end managed to get the info i was looking for  after a 20 min wait
I have made many successful orders in the past but the past 2 orders were sent to the wrong address The first time it happened I thought it must be an easy mistake but when it happened again even when I made special effort to ensure the correct address was entered with the orderI gave up I emailed for assistance and was basically told I must have made the mistakeI DIDNT YOU DID So I have certainly decided to never order from you again I cantyou dont know where I live apparently

I had an issue with a weapon r overflow tank that I bought for my 1995 Mazda Miata  the description said no modification required but thats a lie I emailed customer service to explain that the description of the product was incorrect they disregarded what I said and stated to me that the description says may need some modification I know what the description claimed Im not blind The mishimoto radiator and heater hoses were perfect I would not recommend buying anything weapon r for your vehicle And as far as this company goes Id rather take my business where they do not make false claims about the products they are selling and do not disregard the information you give them
Bravofly is the worst company ever
I bought 9 plane tickets through them The plane was cancelled and i want my money back
Bravofly does everything possible to avoid paying the money back and now i has to use the legal system to make the refund the money for a journy the never delivered
My advise Never buy anything from them Buy your tickets directly from the airlinecompany and not from theifs and hustlers like Bravofly
Aftere I booked the tickets from FlightHub website I see the invoice sent to me including Manulife insurence to my bill automatically even I have deselected the insurence request already The worse thing is when I call the companys line the travel agent refused to cancel it and gave me the hard time said  Manulife Insurence is NOT cancelable Because I insisted to cancel it and explaned that I was deselected that when I operating on line there is no reason to force me pay it if I dont need After the travel agent checked with someone for couple minutes that she was permite to cancel the insurence and refund the money to me
In the meantime I also realized that there is another CND1595 added on my bill The travel agent said that is application useing fee because I used seatmap However it doesnt display on thire companys web application when customer is using it finally they agreed to take out that charge as well but it took me about 20 minutes to argue with them and made me fell angry and disppointed totally
I am not recommend this web site for sure
I made a purchase on Pond5 and it still has their watermark on it I have tried to contact them twice via email and NO RESPONSE So that purchase will be a loss Im really disappointed Pond 5 was the best place to get photos video and illustrations but Im going to try to find another source
I got the wrong turbo I couldnt tell in the picture but this one is for a later 2004 f350 which has the different pedastool so now I have to get that other one Its not that I want or need a sinister sticker or diesel ops sticker or shirt or receipt or anything but you figure when you spend 1600 on a turbo youd at least get a sticker and a receipt
I wish I had seen the reviews re Vinesse at SiteJabber I dont think Ive ever seen worse ratings for a company before signing up for one of their promotional offers I got 8 bottles of reds for 50 and then waited for an email regarding a next shipment so that I could decide if I wanted to accept or reject the shipment No email ever came Instead on a day that I was expecting another package delivery the Vinesse delivery came Without inspecting the shipping label I signed for the package BIG mistake It turned out to be an unasked for delivery of 6 bottles from Vinesse
After several phone calls to Customer Service it turns out the only way for me to know a shipment was about to be sent was if I went to my account every day to watch for the notification I have never belonged to a wine club where they did not clearly let you know beforehand that a shipment was pending and where you could either accept or reject it
We finally settled on a lower price and now I have 6 bottles of wine that I had never asked for and probably could have gotten equal or better quality for half the price
Stay away from this company
There was unexplained additional standing order direct debit after the period of rent No information transmitted by omega on this matter I had nevertheless signed a full insurance contract I am very surprise and disappointed
Hi 
I picked up my bike last week However I went for a ride on Saturday and the tube exploded The bike was premade and I cant seem to take the wheel off to fix which is super frustrating Its been put on so tight
Anyway the bike was good to ride for the short 2 km until the big bang that caused me to fall

They dont care about anything just debit money from your account right after initiating a transaction and wont follow up on that transaction un till you literally call and yell at their compliance department to add on to that worst customer service or there is no customer service at all
in general all sample sound really harsh lacking any warmth
drums with really ugly mono space
not satisfied at all waste of money
I made a booking one way business class ticket with a regular airline At the moment of purchase the ticket the WEB page clearly indicated that I had 24 hour free cancellation from the moment of purchase I decided to cancel the ticket and I called them they told me that I have to pay both penalty for airline and edreams administration fee They told me that I have to prove the offer of free cancelation with a screen photo of the moment of the offer Of course you do not do screen photos while booking the ticket I when to the WEB I typed the same destination date flight and price and the offer of free cancelation appear again I called edreams again I explained and I offer to sent the screen photo but they refuse claiming that the need the one of the particular booking I did I way to scape responsibility and a clear way to offer something at the time of booking they are not ready to fulfill I used them once but not more A horrible experience
We purchased an iPhone 6 11 months ago that was an A grade complete with box charger and headphones and it was fine until 2 weeks ago when the phone would not send or receive texts or calls When we contacted our phone network they informed us that the phone was now blacklisted due to the previous owner and we would need to speak to CEX The phone had cost over 400 and we had our receipt and a 24 month warranty but was told that we would only receive 37500 back either as a refund or a credit voucher We wanted to buy another phone so they gave us a credit and we ordered another phone the same as before and when it arrived it would not hold a charge We took this one back to the store and have now purchased another phone This one is working but have lost a lot of faith in purchasing through this store

staff use terms such as what in defence when asked questions then give blunt rude replies and cut off your chats when they dont know the answers to your questions I was enquiring about their services before purchasing from them when you would think they would be on their best behaviour trying to sell to you and take your money so god knows what their like after they already have your money A guy named Jarad dealt with me I wont be purchasing anything from godaddy
I am not sure what the mistake was or what the confusion is but a L701 key that I purchased does not open a L701 lock However it does open a completely different lock
This is a joke I sent the parcel on February 11th two days later I received an email that the parcel was delivered
Called the DHL to be told it only means that the parcel was delivered to the depot and not to the addressee
Called again today only to find out the parcel didnt even leave the Netherlands They need to investigate  I need to fill out the form and wait 10  working days for the investigation team to do their investigation
Unbelievable
My promo code with Hellofresh did not work and they are refusing to refund my money unless I order another box No thanks Thats not how customer service works I am incredibly disappointed that a company would scam a customer like this and think they can trick them into another box Never again will I purchase from this company
I engaged Universal Relocations to help with my shipping from Alaska USA to Mumbai The experience at the onset all through the shipment arriving at the Chennai Port was seamless and very positive
However when my goods were delivered to my residence in Mumbai I found 2 of my valuables DSLR Camera and Laptop missing from the packages I inquired with Universal and they were baffled since the items in question were examined by the Customs and I was charged Excise duty on the same for which a receipt was also provided
Universal accepted that the items were stolenmisplaced either at their Warehouses or during transit to Mumbai and redirected me to the Insurance claim process  the Insurance company refused to pay stating they cover only full damages to the shipment in event of a catastrophe or damage but do not cover partial loss
Its very sad that such information about Insurance is not provided upfront to the customer and Universal being a reputed company does not even make an effort to make good the loss for a customer All calls to Universal representatives have fallen on deaf ears
I would not recommend Universal Relocations to any of my friends or other folks looking for professional movers
After a negative review Optima contacted me to remove my review if management would contact to talk about refunding me some of my 600000 that i wasted on their services which i got nothing at all in return I gladly agreed I wasnt able to find my review so i called Optima back and they told me they would send me the link to remove it I received NOTHING from them or no phone call

I was disappointed to be charged 50 more then the Quote d price on my booking
I was disappointed that a flaw with the cars electronics meant I got the not wearing seatbelt warning beep every time I touched the brake for about 3 days of the booking
All up I wouldnt use Redspot again nor would I hire a KIA
Collection time said 45 mins but the take away had it ready after 15 mins Every order through this app takes far longer than just eat

That you may know when you want to send money to an African account the message you get is you cannot send them money Simply read between the words and the stand of the company towards Africans will become clear
Paypal considers all Africans thieves and as such if they trust you they would allow you to make payments only but never to receive money
In this time and age this is abusive
Shame on Paypal
purchased football tickets took our money no tickets arrived phone lines go dead worst site EVER
Ordered flowers for my wife wrote a personal message twice on the order process received email confirmation and the message wasnt on it  3 hours after i get in touch with them to change it and they say they cant cause there to busy to fix there own mistakes no help to fix it at all
I could not find the car location

The car had NO fuel and I had first to find a gas station
Never again
Ordered flowers on the Tues for delivery on Wednesday  Flowers were not delivered Emailed customer services 4 times no reply Contacted customer services by phone who advised they would keep me updated  They didnt  Overrall terrible service
We were actually charged more than we were Quote d for our hire car also we have falsely received another rental agreememt at another location that we didnt make and when tried to discuss via phone direct with red spot was quickly put on hold for a prolonged period of time then timed out and line hung up
I have seen nothing but bad reviews on here and the game is scheduled for this Saturday I want to retract my tickets and I dont understand why they have taken my card details either
I want to retract this sale IMMEDIATELY as it has not gone through
I dont trust this site enough please reply to this and confirm you have deleted my account details off your system and released the tickets
UPDATE I also wasnt able to submit the correct information on my tickets because it didnt give the option so I had to submit the nearest thing to it I contacted them TWICE on their contact form and emailed them and no response I eventually got speaking to an online agent who told me she couldnt see anything from my email address I even forwarded her the email and she still couldnt find it even though they were able to email me directly with the correct buyers information To top it all off they stalled the sale contacted the buyer about how I had made a mistake and threatened to charge me if anything went wrong
FOR THEIR MISTAKES Absolutely AWFUL service
I received a faulty product Customer service still hasnt gotten back to me about getting a replacement product OR if I can get my money back Very disappointed in lack of care for the customers If I get stuck with this faulty product I will take further action to make sure I get my money refunded

I used spotaHome to rent an appartement for my children for their Erasmus stay in Istanbul for 6 months The flat was a very bad and unsafe area Drug Prostitution etc In the web site it said that it is in a safe area My children were obliged to return to the appartement before 6 mp and not go out in any case There was no way to know where was the appartement from SpotAHome
It was a good think I only booked one month
At the end of the month the landlord refused to give us back the deposit I contacted the landlord and SpotAhome several times but Impossible I can give a copy of all the emails No answer from the landlord and SpotAhome said we can do nothing it your business not ours
I advise to not use spotaHome They just take the money and In case of problems you have to deal with
Buy from someone else
Delivery people are very unorganized it took me 2 days to get a bed put up because they forgot the screws
I have been chatting with people on transfast for days regarding a transaction and have been told there are partner issues If there is an issue with partnership transfast should not be accepting new transactions until issues are resolved
Review company with bad reviews You do the math They allow merchants to manipulate the reviews by bombarding the compliance department with a ton of reviews that happen to be 1star how surprising The site is called TRUST pilot but based on my experience I dont trust this company
I have used Lifestyle online a few times I cant fault the clothes or the very quick delivery but every item except one was the wrong size which means you still have to go to the actual shop I usually keep them until my boy grows into them
Filed taxes for 2012 Said I can download and print Paid 3495 and says my files have been corrupted and cant use them So basically I got ripped off and now dont know what to do at this point
slow and difficult to book 2 different types of rooms at the same time
Will never rent again
i rented a car and check how long the rental place is open well it seems it will not be open when I arrive  so why was my booking accepted now I need to cancel and rebook  i am glad i checked on this or i would have been stranded
I was bullied on this trip social exclusion by a group of Gen Y women in their late 20s I am 61 and have never been bullied before Resulted partly from poor superviision of group on WA trip Half the group had been together on previous trip No one was introduced on trip I was on and guide changed half way through trip I had a miserable experience and will never do another Intrepid trip in Australia I have previously had very positive experiences with Intrepid in vietnam and exodus in Italy
Food was also poor on WA trip with first guide disassociating herself from any cooking duties Group dynamics took over and result was unpleasant NB I am a print journalist with 40 years professional experience and used to mixing with people of all ages and from all walks of life I am gregarious and consider myself socially well adjusted The only upside if the trip is that I now have increased empathy with those who are bullied
Worst place ever for customer service  Its been 3 weeks and still havent got my part Asked to refund my money and they didnt The package is lost and untill they find  I cant get my money When I do get the package in the mail the said return it and when they receive it THEN they can processes my refund I had to spend more of my money an order it from local businesses and got it in 3 day

The level of professionalism that was present when I initially started using the app approximately 2 years ago has significantly declined to a level mediocrity that I can no longer tolerate Ive kept the app even when one of your drivers REFUSED to return my wallet with all my IDs and over 700 cash I kept an open mind because this was the first time that a driver has refused to return an item of mine and thus effectively stole it However the level of unprofessionalism and the increasingly high degree of unethical behavior I had a driver the other day who KNEW that he was at the WRONG location but refused to cancel the ride when I ask him to for lack of internet connection on my end claiming that it would affect his acceptance rate This is unethical for the drivers to do quite frankly unethical for LYFT to put drivers in a position where they would rather waste 5 minutes in order to keep their acceptance rate high Drivers are consistently late because they cant follow GPS instructions for whatever reason and Im not the only one experiencing this I was paired with a mentally incompetent driver and I am 100 certain of this Ive used lyft on an almost daily basis for approximately 2 years and Ive never before suspected any of the drivers of mental incompetencyThis was the last straw for me Lyft engages in very subtle unethical practices for ex promising its drivers bonuses that it fails to pay 100 150 200 surges and I suspect based on the conversations Ive had with drivers many are often not made aware of these surges Ive a lot of respect for the drivers but Lyft ought to take the hiring process seriously and be more accountable to both drivers and passengers
Ive started using Uber again and so far no complaintsthe professionalism seems to have improved My hope is for more competition
Been almost 2 weeks since I received an email saying my order has shipped Called and sent emails to find out where the order is with no response So far very unsatisfied
5 days and still no shipping info
I needed replacement heater knobs for my 2004 Pontiac Grand Am The knobs were listed to fit a range of years When they arrived a day before scheduled which was great they were black instead of grey and they were too small
Returning the items would have been more trouble than they were worth Now I will go to a local parts store and talk to someone who will order the correct knobs
We traveled to Montevideo Uruguay in a large group of friends and almost everyone hired the World Nomads We went in two cars from Brazil to there All was well until in Montevideo a friend had her purse stolen from inside the car a child threw herself in front of the car and two other children opened the doors of the car driven by my friend stealing her purse with everything Inside  drivers license car documents credit cards money cell phone  everything A police incident was recorded and on the following day a provisional identity document was issued My friend phoned World Nomads to find out how they could help  and the surprise in that case the company could only advance money two thousand dollars As this would not help at all  and we can not understand how an INSURANCE comes down to a cash advance  we will not hire World Nomads any more A situation that unfortunately is trivial today in many countries robberies and thefts of foreigners on the road is not insured by the company and receives no more attention  so dear traveler who does not travel by plane do not fall for it
Viajamos para Montevidu Uruguai em um grupo grande de amigos e quase todos contrataram o World Nomads Fomos em dois carros do Brasil at l Tudo ia bem at que j em Montevidu uma amiga teve a bolsa roubada de dentro do carro uma criana se atirou na frente do carro e outras duas crianas abriram as portas do carro dirigido por minha amiga roubando a bolsa dela com tudo dentro  carteira de motorista documentos do carro cartes dinheiro celular tudo Foi registrada uma ocorrncia policial e no dia seguinte foi emitido um documento de identidade provisrio Minha amiga telefonou para o World Nomads para saber como eles poderiam ajudar e a surpresa nesse caso a empresa apenas poderia adiantar dinheiro dois mil dlares Como isso no ajudaria em nada  e no conseguimos entender como um SEGURO se resume a um adiantamento de fundos  no contrataremos mais a World Nomads Uma situao que infelizmente  trivial hoje em muitos pases assaltos e furtos a estrangeiros em viagem no  segurada pela empresa e no recebe maior ateno  assim caro viajante que no viaja de avio no caia nessa

Worst air travel agency They are a rip off BEWARE
I wanted to buy a laptop that I have been looking for some time and the seller wanted to sell to me Between Paypal over the course of fivesix days of promised calls Jonas in specialist department Arise and Sarah all in phillappeane along with Kay the supervisor who put the phone down on me when I wanted to complain about a twenty six minute hold on the line without someone coming back to me back and many other ill processes with my account I was not able to purchase the item that I really wanted to buy EBay and PayPal had many options to allow this transaction to go through but failed in its duties
Many contradictions with what you are proposing you would know as these remedies and more was attempted You should listen to the calls and since you say your not in a position of authority it makes me more saddened that you have intervened in my complaint where you dont have full authority to investigate
To direct you if you think all of what you are requesting was not tried over a period of more than 10 hours you must be reinformed I even tried making payment from my partners account Open new accounts and tried paying Went through to specialist teams numerous times and had the accoun reset
I specifically asked your team a number to f times to overide make a manual adjustment for me to pay PayPal and complete the transaction I asked for anything possible over this tedious time to complete this transaction Since then the supplier has pulled the item becaus of all the communication he received from PayPal and EBay Which also relates to only part of the times I had contacted with both
I was awarded 20 compensation and I do not feel this relevant for my time phone calls or stress caused Again the seller wanted to sell I wanted to buy this item and between Between EBay and PayPal the item was lost for my purchas because of maladminstration and errors
Its to note that I have purchased many items before and after this With no issues at all That I tried four different credit cards from four different EBay accounts The problem was with EBay and PayPal and not my credit or bank details I want a full investigation from the CEO office compensation letter of apology and explanation for what I have been through I asked both EBay to pull the listing and recreate a new one manually let me pay it or alternatively let me pay EBay and EBay pay for the item on my behalf all were said it could not be done But in your response you are actually stating that a manual payment could be done which is now even more upsetting
Your customer resolve has left me without the item I wished to purchase and I am greatly upset for this
Please pass this onto your CEO and progress this complaint You record your calls and I suggest someone listens to them for verification of my my complaint and what went wrong Its also to note that I did not get a number of call backs as promised from your supervisors Aris in phillapeane Jonas and Sarah This poor service at such a high level details the lack of professional service received
I have already detailed my concerns on one complaint website and will do further as this matter over a five day period was exhausting and you should have been able to resolve this small issue somehow or someway to purchase this item
I had tried to call the center to change the flight and even tired email to the website It seems no one is managing the website and also answering the calls
Such customer service is very disappointing and I do hope to see some improvement here
once you sign up canceling takes an act of god and what the heck is the difference between store credit points VIP points etc no one can tell nor anywhere on the site is it reasonable to find an explanation i have twice talked to someone on the phone about canceling and there is no reasonable way to do it skip a month they say or lose all the credit you have saved no you wont lose it youll just have to pay more what
a scam and a super super annoying one everyone i talk to if this comes up i say DO NOT DO IT
First time using credit card internationally So many holds on the card on my credit cards side and on the side of DHgate Took me 3 hours to make purchases
I received a call from a Verizon customer service Rep Congratulating me for being such a loyal customer He offered me either a 10 savings or a increase in my internet speed I choose the savings and also mentioned that I would like to save even more by returning 2 of my 4 boxes He said that would not be a problem The plan that I have consist of a Multi room DVR and 3 set top boxes which I was able to record and watch the shows on all the boxes As soon as i arrived home my Multi room DVR service was removed from the set top boxes and I can only view my recordings on one box
I called customer service to see why did this happen and requested that my service be restored I was informed that they no longer support the Multi room service and now im forced to upgrade to the Quantum box at a higher price No one can explain why my service interrupted in the first place  That one phone call that was suppose to be saving me money ended up with paying more money for less services Ive been with Verizon over six years and to come to this is unacceptable Spectrum guess you will be my new Cable provider
I have previously bought mats from this company and found them to be good value so I bought some more  12 in fact I checked the item description and photos of the product on their website and these were the same as I had previously bought
When the mats were delivered they were not the mats pictured or described but and were PilatesMad Core align branded mats
I rang to say that these were not the mats pictured on their website and were a a different colour b branded with another suppliers logo When I said I did not want them amd explained the reason they denied they were not the item listed and wanted to charge me for return carriage
A bad experience and I shall not be buying anything from them again  buyer beware  as the saying goes

How can you not allocate my two assignments It should be farely easy using my email and name
Happy to discuss it but would rather do it here
Update 2 on 080317
As I said on my first review stalling
Update 3 on 080317
My only concern is that after all of this nothing was done and Im still an unhappy customer
Ordered an exhaust I was given a price for postage however on sip finalising invoice postage was increased with no consultaion with me as per their terms so order was cancelled on the same day Was told refund would take a few days No refund recieved Emailed to enquire and was assured that it was refunded It wasnt 3 weeks later emailed again They had made a mistake and money was eventually refuded Unacceptable process So much so would never use sip again
they sent me the wrong order and I called the number no the paper told the person that they gave me the wrong order and the order I got from the driver is 706662945 and that is not what I order and the one I order was 706662508 so the person was very helpful and told me that his going to call them to see if they can sent me a new order which I order it more for my daughter I waited and he called me back and told that they sent me the right order and they are not going to sent me another and he told that his is going to refund me my money back and everything Im a little bit upset never had an issue with Popeyes but this is the first time that happen to me
Thank you
No working knowledge of their products and can not work with you on a solution to issues Very disappointed for what their products cost And had to purchase a forth faucet of the same kind I had purchased before from them and was told it was discontinued I had to purchase something else similar Four weeks later I needed something else which they didnt have and found my original purchase back as an option after being told they would NOT be getting anymore back in stock So disappointing
These company is a fraud and than stalk you with 1000 calls for have u back as client
A very bad experience with this company Did not ring our buzzer despite this being explicated on the package Two customer service representatives were curt unhelpful and rude with my wife who wanted to pick up the package but was told this wouldnt be possible without 24hrs notice
You save 50 on your orderbut only 2 ways to ship17 being the cheapest Not sure why they dont provide cheaper ways to ship because I know their out there Too bad I really wanted these shoes
I signed up for the 2 for 2400 leggings Site gave me 1 hour to complete the transaction I tried for the entire hour to place an order It let me choose one pair then It would repeatedly say website not responding I kept trying on my laptop and got the same response I also tried on my tablet and my phone and got the same response I tried to checkout as I was going to add a second pair of the same thing as it would not let me order the other pair I wanted I couldnt change my total items In the last 4 minutes it finally let me add a second pair but it was not the color I wanted and also would not let me have the inseam that I wanted It would not change There was no phone number to try to get help This was a totally unsatisfactory experience
Transactions take ages they seem to hold onto your cash for too long
Also they withhold your transfer whilst they interrogate you about the reason why your transferring money you have to send money upfront before you can garantee and exchange rate do missing the peaks in exchanges
Customer support is slow no one you can speak to on the phone
Overall bit disappointing
The idea seem ok but needs a good streamlining as it come across amitureish
Think Ill use TransferWise next time
This company will not leave you alone I will contact OFFCOM
I accidentally included a book in 2 separate orders I got an email from them saying they will only buy one book and I replied telling them I only sent it once and that I expect to be paid for it They had a computer respond to me saying my order will be processed as indicated I never did receive payment for the book It was a very bad experience
Cancelled my policy saying speeding in excess of 160kph when at the time I wasnt even in the same county as my car Me and my partner went away for weekend and took her car instead Not to mention since having the box fitted half the electrics in my car doesnt work properly
Me and my father wanted to do some boxing training so we searched online and decided to go with ZoobGear The ordering process was easywe paid 100 in shipping which I guess for the weight of everything it was decent In total we paid about 480 or so It took about 4 days for the frame the speed bag and the double end rope to arriveno heavy bag I called them they said it was being delivered separatelyI said ok We inflated the speed bag and tried it outwithin an hour it was deflated We tried putting air in it again and can hear the air coming out of itit was defected Called then and they asked me for a picture and said they are re sending another oneanother 3 or 4 days for deliverythe next day the heavy bag arrivedbut we cant hang it because there was no hook to hang it with I contacted them and they said they would try and send the hook with the speed baglater that night I got a message that the hook would be sent separately toowthAll in all its been a bad experienceI will not be ordering anything from this place againhonestly I think I should get a small refund back for this experience
Had issues with 2 orders in the space of 3 days
Sent a childs size 11 instead of adults size 11 They could not facilitate the original order and their options for returnexchangerefund were not acceptable
I ordered a lamp on the RC Willey website and picked it up Unfortunately I did not ask them to unpack it at the dock so I could check it out I got it home and parts were broken This is the third lamp I ordered that Ive had to make multiple trips back and forth to get the right item and an undamaged one I will no longer take anything packed I will make them unpack it so I can check it out before I take it home I am a bit disappointed in this lack of quality control
Ordered a toaster and kettle set sent the toaster but not the kettle when I questioned I was told they couldnt supply the kettle although I could now buy it separately for another 10 pounds
What a scam Avoid this company
Would never use the site again
I got the 2 in 1 led headlight demon eyes The demon eyes were not as bright as I wouldve liked The headlight started flickering after about 2 months of use tried to contact to get it warrantied but have had no response
If I knew I would experience what I have I would have went some where else I bought a new bedroom set and they told me the bed frame wouldnt be in till march ok Ill deal with that They deliver my Bedset and the dresser had a big chunk out of it and they put the screw through the frame of the mirror while attaching it to the long dresser I contacted the store they said how sorry they were and that was gonna be fixed and I would have new stuff by Tuesday Tuesday came didnt hear anything called up there and the person told me that there was nothing in the computer and that the manager has to approve it when I talk to them on Sunday after delivery that was already supposedly a manager involved  I tried to contact a manager again and they said they were all in a meeting and then went to corporate talk to them they get the situation figured out Then I see that a good friend of mine bought the same bedaet a few days later and we were talking and he didnt have to wait for his bed frame to come in same size bed everything I call the store and they tell me well the computer tells me this so thats what we have to go by I dont i dont understand why I have to wait and extra month after purchasing the bedroom set but when someone else walks in there that I just happen to know they get the same thing at delivery makes no sense to me They also told me I would be receiving gift cards through email after 48 hours and a week later still waiting Im waiting to yet again hear back from a manger
Absolutely awful company to deal with They are like zombies and do not answer the phone or letters You just get a standard computerized email sometimes at 4am in the morning Thank you for waking me up 4 times I have replied with the information I signed the letters requested made statements and now today they tell me they are cancelling the policy as I failed to respond to THEM Thats rich
As I said 4 TIMES I SENT THEM THE INFO
Ive no doubt they will try to sting me also on the deposit paid
this item was ordered on 31 and I received a confirmation after ordering a few days later i saw on my account that it would be delivered 39
on 314 I received an email stating that the other item I ordered with the coat had been shipped I never got an email stating the coat was shipped and wasnt expecting it until after 39 I received the water bottles with no problems
when I checked online the tracking information for the coat said it was delivered on 37 days before I was told and there was no sight of it And there was no email indicating it was shipped as I always get which would have made me even more observant if it came
Ive been trying to contact Groupon since I found out and have had absolutely no response from Customer Service  if it is actually working on any given day
Please let me know why I was never sent the normal email and why this item had a tracking number from Fed Ex but was delivered by USPS which I cant follow up with
I ordered the raspberry and cinnamon twist they are nasty There was no taste very doughy and no filling Waste of my hard earned money
I had a really bad experience with Flight Hub I booked a trip to Indonesia with them but before my departure I reserved an email saying that one of my flight has been canceled So I called them to check what we can do and they said that there is anything we can do I called my airline directly they said that the flight was just transferred to another airline But because I purchased my tickets with FlightHub I needed to change the flight with them So I called again they did nothing they were not allowed to change anything give me another flight or give me credit so I could buy an another ticket only for the cancelled flight nothing Now I am supposed to have a refund but it takes 6 weeks before I get it and I am supposed to leave in 5 weeks I lost a lot of time to finally be disappointed and I need to check for a new flight The customer care did help me at all and my next purchase will certainly not be with FlightHub
The only reason I am writing this review is to give people a heads up
I bought a iPhone 4s battery and charger from Mobymemory On their website they state that they provide Only Original Products Delivery was okay and when the items arrived on the face of it they looked like genuine Apple products However as I was doing a complete reinstall of the phone iOS  during the firmware checks the installation would get stuck and throw an error I put back the old genuine battery and managed to complete the installation Then I put back Mobymemory battery and tried charging it  the battery didnt charge to 100 only to 99 and it would never reduce below 20 I tried calibrating with no avail
Now to me it seems like the battery is not genuine I am baffled that there are no third party body that could verify my findings and if true shutdown the site or trader
I was considering sending the items back and getting a refund however I would be responsible for the postage cost and didnt fancy the hassle of chasing the trader
I rang up approxone month before my policy was due for renewal asking what I needed to do to move to another insurer once my policy ended was told I needed to do nothing from my side which was correct but this should have been flagged that I was intending to leave and an effort made to find out why no joined up thinking and no interest in keeping me as a customer
I was given a rate of 36054 and charged 45897 On booking car I paid in advance 36054 which was what I was Quote d Then I was charged another 9897 with no explanation Please let me know why I was charged
This was the worst show we ever have been too The person lied to me and said she sold me chair back seats Which they were not we sat in the bleachers For one I had a three year old son who was not safe up there I have a bad back And could not Stay for the whole show
Pay attention when reserving I made my reservation on last Sunday 5th March late evening and I wanted to reserve an early departure around 6 am but with the combination I wanted the system kicked me out twice and had to restart booking In the end after confirmation I saw that I got the tickets to the departure of 6 pm instead of 6 am and the whole went very fast and I am sure I never clicked on the later flight it was automatically done by the system in my opinion
It is not my first online flight reservation and I know I was little bit upset but I am 100 sure i never clicked on that combination on which I confirmed later to my big surprise and then shockI wanted to call the client service immediately but it was too late 9pm Sunday so I wrote rapidly an email no answer since then and the next morning I could reach the office and someone who was supposed to help Instead I faced a very impolite and not really kind manner of service clientele and the worker almost lectured me rudely and directly that I should have paid attention more She was basically right but I wanted to express my opinion that the evening before the system of connectionsbe was not really working well and caused me lot of nervousity and i am sure I never clicked on the flight combination which i bought in the end But she did not really care instead she offered me the possibility of changing the tickets 100eur person I said no thank you and finished the conversation with bitter mouthIts not my first time reservation with this company and I know I should have paid attention but at least I could have expected something else of treatment
update I just clicked on my reservation and I just see that my inbound flight is cancelled and I never received any info about this  what is going on
I order lobsters several times a year and am always searching for the best prices from several sites on the internet I discovered Main Lobster Now and found their prices to be competitive or cheaper than most I selected the items I wanted and placed them in my cart then entered my zip code to estimate the shipping cost I was delighted to see that the shipping would be only 100 so I placed the order and received confirmation with a breakdown of the total cost
The next day I got an email from their Customer Service Rep which stated that there was a glitch in their program and I needed to send them authorization to charge and additional 3800 for the shipping
I felt that the glitch was their problem not mine and I was expecting them to honor my order as placedwith an explanation that all future orders would include the correct shipping rate
I do understand their point but I also feel right or wrong that they could have completed the order to pretty much ensure the loyalty of a new customer I did notify them that for years I have place several orders a year but now will most likely look at some of the other vendors for those orders
I bought a case from this site and when it arrived part of the image was opaque where it was supposed to be transparent Also the inside of the case was completely scratched up I have a black phone so as soon as the case was on I could tell that it was damaged and it made my phone looks old and beat up the case is  for the most part  clear Ive sent an email to the company and am taking photos so that I can send another and Ive also talked to an advisor on live chat that simply told me to send another email I spent 50 canadian dollars on this case and its too late to get a refund What a waste of money The only thing positive that came out of this is that the case is fairly decent quality and does a good job of protecting my phone But whenever I decide to use the case it makes the back of my phone look scratched
Charged me full stay in advance when booking with them online Poor way t do business in 2017
Got a 10000 loan Thinking Capitals fee on that 10000 was 4500 They dont tell you that through the phone calls or emails I will never use them again 45who the hell charges that other than loan sharks
I urge every single business in the UK Or anywhere in the world to never ever use PayPal for their banking I urge every single buyer to never purchase anything on PayPal They have gone bust due to their recent lawsuit in the USA where an out of court settlement resulted in them paying 32 million because they suspended and withheld funds from a merchant
In order to make up for this they will be using our money they will not pay your merchant the money you paid through them It is not a secure channel and they have to be sued for the money laundering and withholding customer money from businesss We have a business where customers who paid using their fraudulent card machine device have made payments that they have received but not forwarded to the business PayPal is a fraud I condemn their use worldwide and I would never ever recommend them to be a trustworthy source
Everybody should be filing a lawsuit against them They have no right to prosper and earn interest on other peoples hard earned money
This scam needs to stop and the government needs to impose strict actions against PayPal for breaching all rights of consumer financial protection
From a local Startup business PayPal is trying to make money from
Must have called 5 or 6 times in a 4 week period to get my money back really terrible
Transfast has the worst financial practice They will withdraw your money first and then hold your money saying they need this and that If you know you cant process the transaction then why withdraw the money
Then if you dont agree with them they will hold the money for another 57 days before the money is transferred back I get money transferred from via ACH in 2 days from other banks So the technology and means do exist
And if you ever have to talk to Customer Care they are RUDE and talk as if they are doing you a favor They talk as if they are collection agents and not customer service agents
My bills have got very expensive
as a new user of groupon i found it to be to Complicated and time consuming to navigate thru webpage prices are higher upon clicking view deal example the item shows a regular price of 100 with a promotional price of 25 however upon clicking view deal purchase price is always higher then the highlighted promotion furthermore to much fine print and rubbish which i believe is intended to intentional confuse the customer

The worst shopping online experience I have ever had Dior just cancelled my orders for no reason I checked the items none of them were out of stock I wont buy Dior anymore
I sent in 2 books the one that was worth around 18 I was told there was water damage I know the book was in perfect condition but couldnt prove it and didnt want to take the time to have it returned From now on I will sell my books on ebay no middleman
This was a waste of time Searching for a trip to London and ASAP Tickets Quote d me 614 when my online searches were over 1000 The fine print said prices were guaranteed so I completed the lead form and Shiva called me back in a few minutes I gave him the same criteria I gave the site and best he could do was around 1200 They made no effort to backup their bait Quote  Once they have your mobile phone they email text and call you I did much better on my own with search engines I dont work with bait and switch companies
I ordered an item and the item i received was nit the right one i called to try to get it exchanged and i was told no the item could not get exchanged i coukd return it but it would take 23 weeks fo get the reimbursement credited backnot acceptable
service was excellent and friendly
As Im sure youve read else where This isnt as good a deal as it sounds hugely over priced parts It really isnt worth it
I enjoyed the fact that I was able to get 12 bottles of wine for less than 100 but then 40 was deducted from my account without me placing another order Maybe there was something that I missed reading when I placed my initial order Im calling right away to cancel because I am not OK with them deducting money that I didnt authorize
Only two vines ended up sprouting I spent lots of money on this and they didnt come through
This is about one of the worst rental companies there are the price is so low from one side because once you rent a car youre forced to leave a HUGE credit card deposit which other bigger and better companies dont do for example AVIS only blocks 110 euro So I would rather spend 20 euro more than rent another car with these people
Also they cannot provide proper invoices so for business dont book them it is better to work with bigger companies that provide proper invoices and reply back within the SAME day

Left a review a few weeks ago and Trustpilot removed it stating I left the review with the wrong company which is completely not true I have requested my review be put back up is it was me personal view of my experience and my emails have not be responded to
My company has now also experienced them removing good reviews even with evidence of customer booking details sent to them so again theyre picking and choosing what they want to keep depending on what you pay them
All I want is a fair trade and not this kind of treatment I dont think thats too much to ask for
I have many people to turn to in my industry as were the largest Luxury Transport Company in the UK
I was with this company from 2011 until this year and honestly couldnt have falted them competitive rates and no issues regarding renewal etc This year my Quote went up by 200 so shopped around and found a much better deal they couldnt match it apparently so had to go with competing company They have made it impossible for me to get my no claims bonus cert for my new pollicy fobbing me off with imessages when Ive requested a call back ignoring my requests and redirecting me to the customer portal even though I have insisted 34 times that I cannot find my cert there This began on Monday my policy lapses at midnight and Ive just found out that Ill now have to pay for the cert because they were so slow in responding to my messages literally one message per day even when I reponded imediately Extremely frustrating and to be honest the whoke thing has left with a particular disdain for the company and their so called system
Had to deal with Guardsman insurance and was told that since my purchase was over a year old you cannot submit your claim online you must call in and then mail your claim in After spending 30 minutes on hold the first time and the recording keeps stating to file your claim online After speaking with NFM they stated there is nothing they can do and if my stain had occurred within the first year they would have sent a technician out themselves So sorry that I take care of my furniture so that it last
Nebraska Furniture Mart you can say what you will but I paid you the money and you are not taking care of me the customer Maybe you have ownership of Guardsmen I have had better customer service from my old insurance company when my house burned die then I am having with you and your insurance company Take care of YOUR customers
According to their size chart I was an XL There is even a note saying if you are in between sizes go wit the bigger and have it tailored for a perfect fit It didnt seem right to get a XXL just because Im 44 inches in the hips I though itd be too big since I regularly wear 1012
There were out of XL so I bought a L I figuered fitted was better When it arrived and Intied it on its HUGE besides its a stretchy fabric I called customer service to return but theyre closed on the weekends so I went ahead and ordered another one because I need it for this week and theres no way it will look good if inches have to be taken in An S because theyre out of M as well Medium would be a regular fit because its two inches smaller than what I have and Small will still fit because like I said the fabric stretches So I read the return policy and they will keep a 10 restocking fee plus 8 return shipping And not even return money but give a store credit like its my fault theyre measurements are way off They suggested an XXL but Ill be able to wear a S
I will not return the L one to get ridiculously low store credit because I wont be able to afford anything and I will not pay again for something that will not fit
These people are very poor communicators They use misleading photos of products The right hand doesnt communicate with the left Theyre extremely unprofessional and disorganized They dont return phone calls and they dont process credits for returned merchandise I ordered shelving online It arrived 1012 weeks later really They tried to charge me 4x the advertised price saying they had made a mistake I returned the item for a full refund Again no communication No credit I finally received a full refund when American Express got involved and issued a credit Last I checked the item is still advertised for sale at the wrong price on their website
Companies can dispute the negative reviews and they are not published Use yelp instead

British Gas is the worst company I have ever had the misfortune to deal with Every time I have to use them for anything  even basic things like the annual service  something always goes wrong When you phone up people will say theyll phone you back  they never do theyll tell you theyll do XY  Z to put things right but dont action their promises Engineers dont turn up when theyre suppose to they say theyll phone before they come but dont or they get the address wrong  go to a different property Ive had engineers tell me my boiler is on its last legs  that the replacement parts are no longer available  offered to arrange a Quote for a new one only to find out from an independent engineer that my boiler is fine old but still ok  the parts are still available I cant list all the issues  problems Ive had with British Gas as soon as there is an alternative company offering a comparable service product Ill leave British Gas  throw a party
I ordered 1 inch fire glass first decided to big so I ordered half inch fire glass and when it came It is exactly the same size as the one inch I do not know what to do I opened one of the 10 pound bag and poured it on the floor and open on of the 20 Pound bags of the half inch and they matched the size of the one inch fire glass there was no small ones anywhere Dont know what to do so will start looking for another company 
One company doesnt seem to exist
One company who phoned was not at all interested when the answer to the question what timeframe I was looking at  was  inside the next six months 
And the third company local would have been my first call anyhow
I have had an intoxalock unit installed on my vehicle for a DUI I had gotten 2 years ago I had the unit installed 2 months ago and was excited to get back on the road but In these 2 months I have had to have my car towed 7 times to an intoxalock service center then had to pay the garage for their work on the intoxalock so far I have spent upwards of 1000 dollars so it has costed me 500 a month so far I would not recommend this company to anyone if you would like to continue to have money in your bank account if I could rate them 5 I would and the customer service is horrible one time I had to wait 4 hours trying to get ahold of someone that could help me just for them to tell me to get my car towed I had to build a fire to keep from freezing on that snowy night while on hold Then a supervisor lady got on the phone and was completely rude to me adding insult to injury so now I decided I am going to let my vehicle sit until I can have this unit removed and never talk to this horrible company again I have to wait 10 more months to have the unit removed though because these crooks locked me into a contract with them I picked my car up from the service center this morning in fact I was heading home and stopped at the dollar store to get a few things came back out and tried to power on my unit it didnt work 10 minutes after it was fixed so I had to have my car towed yet again the intoxalock customer service didnt help at all I would have rather talked to a monkey DONT DO BUSINESS WITH INTOXALOCK
Good company when it all goes well  have a problem and they dont care  booked with them for apartment in Spain and after the small print the cost went up from 220 as advertised to just over 800  when phoned to complain their representative was very rude and argumentative and took great joy informing me that I couldnt get my 70 deposit back after being on the phone for over an hour and being put on hold for most of the time  wouldnt recommend this company to anyone and some of their prices in my opinion are misleading

The amount on pay now button 6660 euros did not match the amount of the payment taken from the credit card 7050 euros If there is an additional charge this should be made clear
Booked a car with an insurance company that wouldnt insure me even though I only had 6 points and all OTHER MAJOR car hire companies did insure me

I tried signing in using my account that was opened December 5 2016 However I was repeated informed such an account does not exist Not happy about this
I have to say the biggest benefit I found from this was switching my springs between clutch and accelerator For braking I ended up moving my pedal input indicator on the HUD right above the rev counter so I could see my braking input
I installed the load cell and ended up removing it in the end Too much force was required to brake that I ended up feeling uncomfortable in my lower back The difference between braking really well and really badly was literally millimeters of movement so I figured removing the cell using the input indicators from the HUD and having full range would benefit me more and in my experience it has
Maybe there is something I have not done correctly When calibrating the pedals I initially depressed them 0100 which require a lot of force After that I would depress them to a comfortable pressure like 050 but again I am limiting my range and that difference between good and bad was extremely small In addition trail braking was completely wiped off the table for me with the load cell
Is it just not for me or have I done something wrong
Everything else was excellent about the service
The recipient did not receive the cupcakes that were ordered
My order was cancelled and no reason was provided The costume service told me that I have not been charged but I was Then costume service said it takes a while for the refund and whatnot Dont tell me I was not charged and charge me then tell me to be patient I expected so much more from a brand like Dior but it has been disappointing
They hide somewhere in their order form text that the price is only for a 3 month subscription I bough the software thinking I would own it out right Perfect example of learning about the fine print When i asked for my money back they referred me to there email support I was only given the option of buying more of their software at a reduced price Very frustrated with this company If youre going to sell a product be upfront with your customers
Bought a flight ticket on 11th March to a trip with Pegasus Airlines on 29th March but with open date option Wanting to change the date I found myself unable to request this on the webpage and Customer Service can only be reached by phone Tried several times to phon but every time got the message I was in a que and average response time would be 4 minutes and 23 seconds After appx 2 minutes waiting the line was hang up on me  every time
Having read all other reviews I will now consider to report the company to Spanish Police for fraud through my companys Spanish office

This site is overpriced and they do not keep what is offered In the detail overview of the apartment many things are left out of the description Apartment was not in good condition when I arrived It should be their responsibility to check on the apartments they offer their customers as they are the agency in charge I feel misguided and definitively not having a good experience
In the pictures the glasses were pink but when i got them they were black
It seems like if I order more than one thing there will be at least one thing wrong with something I dont know why I keep ordering from Groupon Linda

BangGood charged me 52 few days ago and I dont even knew they existed before that
They are thieves because after every possible proof from the bank they say that they cannot find transaction
Dont buy anything there dont trust them
The site constantly tries to sneak additional things into your basket that cost extra Even after checking everything carefully and unticking everything that was extra I noticed that the total on the payment page was 050 more than previous pages had stated At this point I couldnt be bothered going back and risking losing everything Id filled out in the forms
Everything was great til they didnt take my old mattress They should just tell you up front the if your mattress has any tears or stains they will refuse to take it Instead they ask if you want them to when your at the store paying so you think everything is great and no worries Then the delivery truck shows up and the delivery guy say no they wont want me to put that on my truck like it some piece of trash in the side of the road When a mattress is 15 years old of coarse its gonna have a stain or two or maybe a rip
Not happy at all thanks for the burden

Ordered a Sony Alpha a7II camera bundle from them because their price was slightly lower than elsewhere The website said it was in stock After I ordered they called to try to confirm the shipping address and then promptly tried to sell me an extended warranty and additional accessories which I refused
After getting no shipment confirmation I called them today and talked to Jeff who told me that the camera was backordered for 12 weeks When I asked why they hadnt bothered to let me know during the earlier phone call or subsequently he became rude and asked me whether I wanted to cancel my order but offered no apology whatsoever
Now Im hoping that I can order the camera from a more professional retailer in time for the trip I wanted the camera for
USPS tracking systems does not provide very good order tracking maybe consider a better tracking service Basically only confirms delivery Never received my order and CS would not reship product without me giving credit card to buy another part then I would need wait for refund on lost item once they resolved issue with USPS I had to wait until day 8 until they shipped out new part Thanks JR
I understand this stuff happens but is it too much to ask to overnight another part ASAP I have been without a car for over a week now
I have placed an order long in advance to ensure my other half gets her anniversary flowers as she was abroad at the time They contacted me at the end of supposed delivery day to inform me that they cant deliver Unacceptable for a florist I did not have enough time to arrange with a different florist Huge disappointment and a poor late communication I am keeping my fingers crossed for a refund now
I went to this company looking for a title loan I can say now Im happy they didnt give me one because I dont want to be stuck with a loan like that or dealing with this company I spoke with a woman named Jill if I am remembering her name correctly we spoke for almost 30 minutes going through all of my info and all seemed fine she said come in and it will take only a couple of minutes I went into the office and was there for an hour Jill was late for work so they said start with another gentleman and she will help when she arrives 3 offices and 5 people late I walked out with no loan There offices are weird all open no privacy they dont know whats going on at one point one of the guys who dealt with the insurance was drilling me about my company because it is similar work insurance and he said he was looking for something new as this place was cheap as he said If you can help it please dont use a company like this or this one At the end of the day the hassle you will get into paying off a very high interest loan that youll end up paying back two or three times is not worth it Stay away from this company
I am no scorned due to not getting a loan I choose to walk out with no loan They tried to tell me my car was worth very little they will repossess and sell your car if your payments are late I have since sold the car and made 6X what they said my car was worth Please stay away from this company Dont let there 1520 speech about how bad all the other loan companies are scare you into them remember they are one of those loan companies they just dont include their own name in the speech
Cars cost too much Need to have cheaper sites available
I ordered on Thursday  not realizing it was an East Coast company that closes at 5 EST Im on the west coast On Friday they tell me that they needed to check with Dr about prescription But never told me they didnt get through to Dr On Monday I called and told them if they didnt ship out that day I would have to cancel because it had already been 5 days since ordering and I was running out of contacts They finally cleared my prescription and shipped on Monday Only to find out it will take over a week to get the product I didnt get my contacts until the FOLLOWING Tuesday if I had know how long it would take I would have chosen a different company
The lack of information like a tracking number is quite bad specially when you dont have a estimation delivery date and you order has not been received after two weeks
The worse anyways is the answer I got after emailing you guys There is no tracking number The order will be with you shortly
Still waiting
I ordered a ticket from israel to cape town and the name of the ticket was wrong  they use my first name as the the first and the last
I couldnt abort on the flight so I should order new ticket that cost a lot of money
They didnt respond to me
now I need them to change the name of the ticket to the way back and they dont respond
Avital
I asked for a super expedited visa and it took more than 30 hours I could have purchased one at the border I followed up earlier but no one mentioned that I could use the receipt at the border so my colleagues had to leave without me I am now taking a shuttle on my own
Most of the stuff that Ive ordered are wrong sizes There isnt enough information on the articles I ordered 6 shirts in M size and all of them were slim fit and it didnt say that on the article description So I had to pay for both shipments  ordering and returning it back
Most of the posters expect taskers to work for as little as 200 per hour It sickens me how many specially in the creative fields rush to offer their services at such a poor rate
That manager is to disrespectful w the customer
I had purchased my ticket online and I realized that I didnt put my married name on it So I immediately call FlightHub to have my last name added But I was told that I had to pay 7500 to have my name change I told the lady that I just literally purchased my ticket and it was a honest mistake So my husband got on the phone and tried to explain what happened but the lady still insisted that I pay 7500 So my husband asked to speak to a manager He was on hold for a long time on the phone So he hung up and called back It took about six minutes for someone to talk to my husband My husband still got the same answer I think it is a outrageous for Flighthub to charge an extra fee to modify my name It is not like I waited a day or two to call to add my last name But I literally called as soon as I noticed that I didnt put my last name Flighthub should go out of business for being GREEDY
While drive time makes it easy for you to get a car even with a bad credit like myself theres always something behind that I got a Toyota Corolla last month from the pinellas park location I was on a tight budget and I didnt wanna keep bothering the sales guy Trevor to test drive anymore cars as I felt he was getting irritated with me and I neeesed to get a car that day The car was ok when I first got it a week later I started feeeling the steering wheals brakes the car being shaky if I drive it over 60 and the sound it makes when I hit the gas Keep in mind my payment is 209 or around that every 2 weeks Thats my very own first car ever with my name financing I also have a child so safety is very important to me I couldnt stress more about this part when I was there so they can be honest with me and show me to a good car Its only been a month I cant afford to take it to the shop with this payment I make on it plus 160 insurance Im so disappointed because I thought at first I had a great experience there but i guess you can never have a good experience in a buy here pay here kinda dealer because they know youre a desperate for a car with a low a credit score Thanks a lot guys
I bought a new Lezyne GPS in a bundle package that included heart rate monitor and handlebar mount The HRM will not pair with the GPS unit so I contacted PBK I received an do not reply email with a reference number confirming their receipt of email and that they would be in contact within 48 hours Well its a week later and no response Very frustrating when you consider I receive emails from them about every second day promoting their products I want to impress upon them that customer service is super important especially when there are so many other companies that are fighting for the same dollar
The punishment fee of the Vueling airline is ridiculous when you want to change the date of your flight I paid 400 euro for my first tickets and when I asked for the new price to change the date they asked for 800 euro more There is no way a ticket cost that much they are just there to trick you I booked through Bravofly and they had written on their webpage that it only costs 50 euro to change the date I also got a cancelation insurance through them that didnt do a thing I will never book through this company again and I wouldnt recommend anyone els to do it either It may sound cheep at first but do not get fooled by it Bye bye money
I twice went through the complete process of making a booking including providing my credit card authorization but when I submitted the requests I received replies that the flights were no longer available at the price shown If the price offered is incorrect why isnt it changed I searched again and found an acceptable alternative and tried to select seats But all that was offered was the choice of a eat next to my wife or any available seat The cost of this seat selection showed up in the charges column even though I had no idea what the seats would be This is not seat selection it is a total ripoff A very poor experience with FlightHub
My exprience started well Steve who was my first contact was wonderful and he stuck with me through the whole process I would give Steve 5 stars As soon as the process moved west from New York to California and Carmen took over everything fell apart The main problem was communication either confusing or more often just not there The problem mostly concerned the fact that I have a power of attorney for my nonborrowing spouse The notary public here and I litterally had to resign the papers four times before closing And I still have not got my original power of attorney back Carmen I give no stars at all Put them together and add that it took from October to March to complete the process I have to give the overall process two stars That being said I still really appreciate Steves support and help to work everything out
Called twice today seeking help with testing the service but got nowhere The same woman Michelle who had no clue  and kept saying she only responds to billing and shipping no customer support However the number listed to call for Customer Support 8774440002 led to her even when I pressed Tech assistance When I asked to speak to a supervisor there was no one available Terrible
SO different from the OUTSTANDING service I got to download the app and set up my contact list
So disappointed
Order was sent by Fed Ex for delivery only to me My mom was in the hospital and fed ex refused to redeliver Now after fronting several hundred dollars I still have nothing Price sucked anyway and they cannot do anything other than the simplest lenses Never ever again
I purchased 2 tickets late one night before I went to sleep When I woke up the next morning my friend had surprised me with tickets and they were in hand I called to cancel unable to but it was suggested to resell them on stubhub Then the shipping date got changed for whatever reason and I didnt get them in hand until 2 days before the event which made it impossible for me to resell them online Also face value was 100 I paid 117 then an additional 100 in fees and shipping It would be nice to have a 24 hr option to cancel
I signed up to energia in the hope of reducing our bills on average by 15
Instead our electricity is more expensive and our gas bill is about 46 cheaper
Discounts advertised dont play out in reality
I had to buy two different types of unlocks one was for an IMEI unlock and the other one an Unlock Device App unlock for my ZTE ZMAX Pro MetroPCS phone I was first told that it would take one to two days to unlock my phone I was emailed a confirmation telling me that the Unlock Device App on my phone had received an code and was ready to unlock But everytime I tried to unlock it I still get the message Unlocked Failed blah blah I have already tried the chat feature and submitted two service tickets and have gotten no response I even called the telephone number listed in the Contact Us area of their webpage and was not able to speak to anyone Ive been emailing back and forth and I am being given erroneous information One minute they are telling me that they have unlocked the Unlock Device App on my phone with instructions via email on how to unlock it I followed the directions and STILL NO UNLOCK I notified them and the next minute they are telling me that I have to wait another 5 days for my phone to be unlocked I have paid 3395 for a premium unlock that I never got I am very frustrated and I want a COMPLETE REFUND Caution ALL US BUYERS BEWARE
To say Im disappointed is not enough
Ive ordered the 10g 20 RAW Hemp Oil which came in a couple of days After reading all the good reviews I was really excited and couldnt wait to try it Ive opened the package and as instructed Ive turned the ring counterclockwise 1 turn pushed the plunger but only air came out turned the ring another turn and again only air Third turn and only oil came out another turn and the paste started coming out
Dont know if it works as I only took my first dosegram and dont know if I will find out as there are now only 6g left in the syringe If I follow the dose recommended in the video that should last me 3 days that is if I dont have anymore surprises
I dont think Ill be buying it again as it is extremely expensive at nearly 180 for a 10g tube that comes half empty
No warranty redemption
We ordered a gown for my daughter a gown for Prom we ordered a 2x She wears a 2x from all the other stores we deal with but this 2x is actually a size 14 I called Prom Girl within 15 minutes of delivery to get return authorization I was told that I will only get credit I am not happy with that as they have very little in a true 2x I will not be dealing with them again Please realize that you must check your measurements of each and every dress as they all are different A 2x in one will not fit a 2x in another
It took ages for a email telling me after me looking repeatedly on the website and it saying it in depo and I brought the last one in stock for cex to tell me its cancelled and I now awaiting still on money back that was ment to be ten working days that was 14 days ago  Store where I live great website crap is the kindest words
Beware you book a car and then you are contacted by this broker to say the car isnt available but for an extra 10 you can have another car

my claim took nearly three months to be paid I had three different claims reps including a supervisor  none of which provided any feedback throughout the process My three requests to be referred through to their IDR process were ignored Totally unacceptable service
It took 40 mins to check out the car I had already paid full insurance with Rentalcars but was happily told by Alamo that if I had an accident that I would have to pay them in full and reclaim against Rental cars The check out lady had no customer service skills whatsoever and did not understand her own fuel choice chargesIf I return to Iceland I would not rent through Alamo
Soooo not user friendly website Trying to edit your photo book was impossible  Could not change front cover  Very frustrating  Gave up trying to change it very very disappointing
However the quality of the prints on the book were good 
I have just booked two tickets from Amsterdam to Brussels Central with booking no VGVXXNJ But the ticket is only from Amsterdam to Brussels Midi Can you tell me the reasons Please reply as soon as possible by email
It was a big disappointment
Would not recommend this company to friends or family
Inadequate email and registered post letters sent from them to me when they installers for the box was the problem NOT me
and never a rent This is the most cheating rent company I ever found It catch you showing very competitive renting rates and you bookat the desk you will ALWAYS really ALWAYS a lot of additional expenses cleverly hidden in the app or the website its a shame because the app is very nice and effective
The item I received was not what I ordered
Golcar is Dangerous

Ive received an email from them from whatever reason of course it was classified as spam but I still dont like when my email address wanders in the wild so I wanted to oppose to its usage in writing Of course no way to do that via email even when you read their privacy policy being based in Europe I need to write a letter to their London base Although I will probably do so it makes it very slow and difficult
I like that the delivery was quick however the product itself was sticky and not what I hoped for
I still havent recieved or updated any cargo intime status I ordered 1 month ago
The toll reader should have billed me 600
I received a charge of 2575 
Everything thing else was great
Im sure Ill get a replacement for the defective cartridge that I received but this was my first order from Inkfarm so its a hassle and Im not impressed
They sent the wrong item
I phoned to get a returns number
Their employee argued about it and insisted on photos
I eventually told him just to send the returns reference
He said he would
Nothing happened
Several days later I got in touch with Paypal and the same day I received the reference number
Item was sent back and I got a refund but they wouldnt pay return postage
So I lost money because of their mistake
I will never use or recommend them again
Thank heavens for Paypal
Didnt deal with issues correctly and poor handling of situation
Bought this thinking it was a UK company They ship the boosters in from china and I go a 4694 fee The company didnt want to know and were just patronising on the support chat I was going to send it back for a full refund but guess what  you have to send back to china So I guess Ill have to such it up That will teach me for not doing my research Hopefully this review will save someone else the pain
My wife got the progressives we ordered top of the line lenses an over 500 order The bottom of the lenses has the reading prescription  naturally
However the user experience is poor  while reading edges to the left and right are strongly distorted making it seem like you are reading through a tube with blurred edges The reading area should be much wider
I advised that she lets her brain get used to it for a few weeks before returning it That has not helped Now reading the return policy I see it needs to be unused with original tags and stickers to return it
How can you have experienced the glasses without trying them This is an unreasonable return policy What will the company do with the returned prescription lenses anyway This is their way to have a return policy on paper and then not really having a return policy in real life
Now that this part is disappointing lets review the ordering process
Multiple times I uploaded the prescription online and it didnt take even though the web page confirmed the upload I cant know it failed this way until a week later getting the reminder email to upload the prescription After weeks of back and forth with customer support finally I needed to send the prescription via email After all that extra effort it still took more than a month for the glasses to arrive
I would like to build a group that will fight the ability of this agency to swindle their clients with false claims and reassurances To put in short form
1 We booked an 8day holiday We did note that the first day started at 530 pm Dec 24th but decided the 12 am departure on the last day Jan 1st would at least ensure we had a full final day at the resort
2 after waiting until less than 2 weeks from departure to receive the paperwork from the agent Airlineticketcentre  it was discovered that the checkout time at the all inclusive resort was noon
3 All of you count with mecan anyone find the 8 days This was unacceptable to all us as we had paid for that 8 days
4 I immediately called Airlineticketcentre and questioned this  indicating it was not reasonable and not acceptable for our party of 4 to be stranded for 15 hours without a room etc
5 Agent Francina from Airlineticketcentre repeatedly consoled me with the statement the stated checkout time is only standard  the hotel knows you will not be leaving until midnight I continued to lament that the ticket very clearly states a noon checkout but she became irritated and told me do not worry Famous last words
6 To ensure our last day was enjoyable we tried to confirm with the hotel that we would not be checking out at noon as stated on our ticker The hotel insisted we leave our room  I refused so in the end and not until the final day  the hotel conceded in part but made us combine into 1 room The hotel also informed us Sunwing had only PAID THEM till noon which meant in fact we no longer were eligible for food and drinks for the next 15 hours ANDSunwing had more clients coming in that night for our room who had also paid for their Day1 at the hotel though not arriving until after midnight
7 So Airlineticketcentre and Sunwing has collected Day 8 for services from us while also collecting for Day 1 from another set of travelers for the same room
8 In the final days at the resort leading up to our departure I had reached out to the booking agent Airlineticketcentre on 2 occasions asking that they live up to what they had told me and straighten this out with the hotel Not surprising  the emails were ignored and in fact I have never had a response to them
9 The Sunwing agent at the resort Maria was a horrible person to start and we witnessed many arguments with other clients Here response  we count that as a day
If not for the hotel willingness to work with us and allow us to eat and drink at the resort we would have been left DESOLATE with all our luggage for 15 hours Airlineticketcentre and SUNWING DOUBLE DIPPED and left us holding the bag so to speak Thankfully the hotel took pity on us  BUT only after much fighting stress and of course my refusal to leave the room
Sunwings and Airlineticketcentre both have continued to argue that the information was on the ticket and therefore they can call any length of time 8 days as long as we agree to it They state I should have called had I not agreed to the terms BUT I DID CALL AND I DID STATE CLEARLY THAT WE DID NOT AGREE TO THE TICKET TERMSSunwings response  you must have some misinformation Airlineticketcentres response  we offered for YOU to pay for extra days Are you kidding me Airlineticketcentre  I already paid for the vacation and would have canceled had Francina NOT LIED and would have been happy had Francina dealt with the hotel AS REQUESTED
Glitch in online booking Only booked one ticket On hold for 1 hour 45 mins to be told the 2nd flight I needed doubled in price I would need to pay 7500 to change the ticket to the up saled flight
I had a table being replaced under the warranty I had purchased The truck was out for delivery on Tuesday I called in the morning and said The time will not work for me So they were scheduled to come out the next day I get a call the next day saying that they discontinued the table so I either get the floor model or a different table even though the table was on the truck in a couple hours from my house Long story short I only got the floor model table top very disappointed in the fact that they had it and would not give it to me
I know the item I ordered stated it was a non returnable item was not what I ordered nor would it work
I was very disappointed in quality of Refills They compare with ones I got from a Company named COSTCO that has same service I would purchase new units from you but I can get new Cartridges from a Company named Staples Office Supply Cartridges are a little more but I save because of your shipping charges If they become unavailable I will order from you again Thank You
Placed order on December 31 2016 They took money from my Paypal account on January 4 2017 Today is March 13 and still no order received I have tried to contact them via email 3 times They responded 1 time saying it was on its way Next 2 contacts I got no response I will never order from this company again
The appointment for the collection of my vehicle was arranged for pick up between 08000900 at 0920 I cancelled the appointment as I had to leave for work They did try and tell me it was booked in between 08001000 but that is not what I arranged and not what was stated in the numerous text messages and emails Would I use again No
I was charged twice for parking once their machines are broken
I said your website sucks
did not get the expected result and the help line wasnt helpful
I returned two tops I purchased online to the store and was incorrectly informed that items purchased online via paypal had to be returned by post I returned the items at a cost of 5 and found out afterwards from a colleague that this is not true that she has returned items to the store even though they were purchased via paypal
Download did not work would not boot
Ordered back in December and have still not received what I purchased What I ordered a phone case and glass screen protector for an iPhone 7 plus What I got a phone case and glass screen protector for a regular iPhone 7 No big deal it happens But for the past three months it is now March 3rd Ive been trying to exchange for a new size and still have not received what I originally ordered
First of all there is no customer service phone number on their website so I had to send an email about my request for an exchange I received general instructions about how to return my unwanted case so I sent it off with detailed information about the actual sizes I needed and where to send them After tracking the package I found that the items had been successfully returned back to their facilities but for two weeks after that date never heard anything about the status of my exchange I never got an email saying the old items had been received and I never got an email about when my new case was set to arrive
After sending many emails with no reply I finally resorted to direct messaging the company on twitter I got a quick response and was told on February 21st that my old items had indeed arrived but had never been processed I was assured that my exchange was accepted that day and that I would be given a tracking number as soon as my new items shipped in the next 12 days Well 6 days later I still hadnt received a tracking number so I messaged the same person on twitter where I was told my items didnt ship out until that morning the 27th She gave me a tracking number and told me I could expect my items to be delivered in 23 business days
Fast forward 4 days I just tracked my package and come to find that even though I was told it shipped out on February 27th it didnt actually ship until March 1st Although I should have received my products days ago they are still is Los Angeles California Im so incredibly frustrated and wouldnt recommend ordering from this site solely for the fact that their customer service cant get their crap together and if by chance you are sent the wrong item you wont receive your actual order for another 35 months
received my sheets in the wrong color
Huge disappointment The picture showed they came in a vase they were in a cardboard box Cookies tasted old and flavorless My fiance who I bought this for said he was scared he would break a tooth on the cookies they were that hard and dry It broke my heart this was his Valentines gift A complete waste of 8000  We threw the entire thing away after one day BUYER BEWARE
I ordered a Religious candle with a LeD light for my friends 100th Birthday I ordered it in plenty of time received it and decided a week before the party to put in batteries It did not work I called and explained the situation and that I would order another one but needed it for the party in a week
The response was that Id have to pay the extra charge I asked the Agent to speak with her supervisor since it was not my fault The answer can back NO I would have to pay I was extremely polite but told her that this was my first purchase from Figis and it will be my last
This company needs to understand that for a 10 bill it was foolish to loose a customer
Moral YOU NEVER GET A SECOND CHANCE TO MAKE A FIRST IMPRESSION Buyer beware customer service is VERY inflexible and definitely should drop the word service
Ordered top and pants for sons birthday When I went to wrap it wrong size pants had been sent I rang customer help line but as it was a Saturday not open Rang nearest shop in Galway to see if hey had right size They did not They said they could order it in  so I requested they do so They said they couldnt do it over the phone and I would have to go in I would have to pay for new ones and they would do a refund on the original ones but it could take three days to be refunded to the card I told him this was crazy He said I was better off ordering to home address but as I explained the one item on its own didnt qualify for free delivery So I would have to pay 4 Euro delivery for their mistake He said I should wait till Monday and contact customer services I explained it was my sons birthday the next day and surely he could order the correct pants over the phone with my card number However he said I had to be in the shop to order  At this point I gave up rang Elverys to see if they had it  They did and put it aside for me Went to Elverys got pants and was able to give to son for birthday Very poor systems and customer service No help if its the weekend Cant believe I couldnt do exchange over the phone and would have to pay again and then claim a refund A very poor and frustrating experience
Im afraid I have to agree with Marius Nedelcu Theres only transparancy in Travelgenios costs after its too late and not even then
During the booking it is never stated that checkin luguage is may not be included in the booking Moreover I thought I booked special luggage sporting gear I had to find out afterwards I only booked handling fees or management fees and not the actual special luggage itself Finally I had to pay 120 on top of my ticket 60 for the checklin luguage 60 for the sporting gear both ways
A travel companion of mine booked the same flight with the same sporting gear but he had to pay 35 for the gear instead of the 30 I had to pay He phoned them and try to explain that this was a case of arbitrariness and demanded to pay the same amount as me There was no way he could make them understand
I complained about the whole thing stating that I would be more careful next time booking with an intermediary
Travelgenios Cristina laughed right in my face replying Thank you very much for trusting Travelgenio
Edit Im pretty sure half of the positive reviews for Travelgenio on this site are fake Please note how only reviews with a good rating get the verified order sign Could it be that it is no concidence that only happy customers are invited by Travelgenio to write a review I provided Trustpilot with my booking details but no verified order Funny
Ive been deducted EUR 299 for something I to the best of my knowledge did not buy Trying to figure out what it was I wrote amazoncom since Im more comfortable with English than German being from Denmark They informed me that I should speak to amazonde
I went to amazonde even though I complained about it to the Amazoncom employer
At amazonde I asked to get a call and gets a call from an automated German speaking voiceyoud think once they know its not a German area code theyd use an English speaking voice but no German it was and I had to press some random number I got some German guy who did not speak Englishwho does not speak English these days but transferred me to an English speaking agent
Unfortunately she was not able to find my address even though spelled it out to herseveral times and I used the address confirmed by their own automated order confirmation email Apparently she cant access my account if she cant find the address in her system though they know how to send items to my address and apparently deduct money from my account
Im not sure if it was the system or the employee but spending an hourso far to get EUR 299 is just plain insane but I do not want them to deduct that amount every month and think they can get away with that
I asked for an email address which she gave mefirst she spelled out for me and I double checked it spelling it out to her which of course was wrong so I had to google it myself It seems amazon is going down the drain
Since I havent got a receipt since I contacted amazon to find out why they deducted money from my account Im not sure if this gets accepted by trustpilot But Ill make sure to warn people at other sites if trustpilot cant be taken serious anymore
These keys were ordered as replacement keys by the number on the original keys They fit in the lock but dont work They did come quickly

Booking travel for a business trip to Cologne and selected 1st class as offering free seat reservation This would allow me to sit next to a colleague and plan for the business trip ahead At no point in the booking process was I able to select my seat so presumed I would be able to do this after making paymentnot the case
I telephoned customer support who advised that there is no option to select your seat when making an online booking and that I now had 3 options speak to the train manager on the day ask another passenger to move or pay an extra 47 to change my seatyou are joking
Its a good job the customer support lady who answered the phone was very friendly and polite otherwise I would have vented all my frustration You dont make their jobs easy
One would think it common sense the functionality to select a seat would be built in to the online booking process but no So if you want to reserve a seat book your ticket over the phone
I didnt get 1 item delivered
Purchased the senior name labels but after a wash the labels are gone
They do not stick 
Cannot submit meter readings when you want Only submit when they want previous provider you could submit 247
While the rental price seems ok the fuel  refuelling charges are a matrix so cannot establish the exact cost before you hire the car
The problem is when you have a fullempty fuel policy you must pay for a full fuel tank plus a fuelling charge on arrival but you cannot be clear on the amount by looking at the website so must await turning up at Goldcar before knowing what they will decide to charge
I am very disappointed I received books that had slips of paper and personal writing from previous owners I dont believe these books should be categorized as good condition
After contacting thriftbooks they sent a replacement for one book and the replacement was in the same exact condition They are now refunding my money for one book
I submitted a claim in September 2016 and have not heard anything since I have called several times and left messages with no response I have emailed Outdoorsy repeatedly still no response All Im asking for is my out of pocket experience due to a propane issue with the RV we rented
I ordered a stream cleaner online The product arrived opened and appeared to have been used and the manualinstructions were also missing I telephoned customer services who got the store manager to call two days later He denied product had been used but could not explain why the box was open or the manualinstructions were missing He undertook to get a new manual from the manufacturer and said he would call with an update This was two weeks ago and Im still waiting
I ordered a package direct from Singapore It arrived in good time however the Waybill I received was not in my name They tried to blame the shipper and took over a day to find the Waybill with my name on it After numerous failed attempts at trying to pay online I navigated my way through the mazelike phone system to try to speak to a human I was hung up on twice and they would direct me to the automated phone payment system which couldnt find my waybill After calling numerous times I was understandably very frustrated The last woman I spoke to was completely unprofessional would say things like did I say I was going to transfer you after I asked her not to put me on the phone payment system since it has failed for me numerous times After I said Pardon she told me something completely different Worst customer service experience Ive had in a very long time I dont know why this company exists in the first place I hope to never deal with these people or this company again
Disappointed I reordered my prescription for the second time but it has been 2 12 weeks was just as long the first time but I was told it was just a RARE case of them being out of my prescription my order still says processing I have emailed customer support twice with no response I like the prices but wont return a third time because the wait is too long and I cant get any response to tell me what is going on Not good customer service and Im still waiting on my contacts that I have already been charged for and a response back from customer support they replied back to this saying that they did respond to my emails but did not I have no such emails but the made sure they responded to this complaintmean while still waiting
Its great to be able to use a trusted service to buy and sell tickets BUT 20 is a massive charge This is compounded by the fact the UI is hard to use the ticket info is not validated so when buyers want to search for tickets they only have the option of cost not location original price etc Payment is also very slow taking a week after the concert seems a long time when you have the credit card details of the seller At 10 with improvements to the UX this could be a great service
Also please stop referring to yourselves as an Australian service in marketing material to NZ customers
If you advertise a book as containing a DVD then the book should be delivered with the DVD IT is a simple concept the seems to have been lost
I would have been totally OK with not receiving the DVD but the fact that the book was specifically listed as containing one
Other tow book in the order were fine and in good condition
TLDR  Transfast sucks pretty bad dont get fooled by better rates use Xoom or icici or something else instead
Congratulations TransFast you saved some money making the website of yours using those cheap developers and now you are losing business Was it worth it
Mine and I see many more peoples transaction was cancelled because the documents couldnt be verified Its because their website sucks Your customer support team is replying to peoples comments to discuss what went wrong thats even better All I want after cancelled transaction and a upsetting review is discussion
I would like to know on a public forum what would you do for your poor service and cancelled transactions Do you give a better rate faster transfer turn back time and make the money transferred when it was supposed to or just send an apology and discuss how stupid the user of your website are to even use your services and they should go for ICICI Xoom or some other remitting service
EDIT 
after review we asked you to upload the remaining documents in question 
 The email specifies some documents are missing
 when logging into website a pop asks for SSN and then disappears
 The subject line of the email says AML documents
Do you see the problem here  No communication from your end specified WHAT document you need from me not even the Verify Documents link on your website
You need to understand how crappy your website is which is the sole service you are trying to provide
Ordered 2 toys both of which were faulty
Purchased a new soundbar Hooked it up worked once then unable to turn it on in again Printed return label Returned item via post office and waiting for a refund which appears may take quite a while to occur Usually buy from Amzon there return policy and refund policy are a lot more consumer friendly Can not say if Groupon is a good or bad service there yet AS A FIRST PURCHASE VERY BAD PRODUCT WISE Packing left way to much room for the product to slide around in the box Again Will see if refund process makes up for it Not sure what company does the packing Price was nice if it worked
i bought a ticket and i had misspelled my middle name in respect to my passport i wrote them to let them know and all they were willing to do was try to steal my 987 dollars and tell me that i would have to buy a new ticket i contacted United Airlines and they said that they could fix it no problem and they did They explained that they could not change first or last name but a middle name so that it reflects my pass port no problem so this company lied and tried to steal my booking i will never use this company ever again
Not happy with invited unable to order see above

Ive booked hotels with bookingcom lots of times Ive been able to reserve rooms and cancel them within the feee cancellation time I was looking for hotels in Rome for my mother in law who is disabled  I reserved a few different ones as Ive also done My bank rang us to say that all our money had been take out of our account and left us with nothing I was baffled by this as this has never happened before Bookingcom say thats its a preauthorisation from the hotel and no money is charged to that card I beg to differ bookingcom cause youve left us with no money to live Dont believe what they tell you They are saying its going to take 5 working days for the money to go back in My husband is going away before then and has no money to go with It shouldnt have been taken in the first place Will use Expedia from now on MISLEADING UNTRUSTWORTHY service from bookingcom will not use this service ever again
They dont reply to emails
Booked a car for pickup at Townsville on a Monday morning and the was no sign of any staff Had to find a red spot number and call the central reservations She called the staff member who was outside washing a car My flight was dead on time and he went out to wash a car I had to wait over 10 minutes more before he finally turned upis whole process made me 30 minutes late
If I can give zero star I would give minus it is down down store I was bought perfume in myer werribe the lid is leak and I went to exchanged  but a woman sales refused me because the plastic of cover was gone excuse me as customers how we know the product has problem till we used it  Then talked to counter manager a Chinese sales she also didnt understand the problem just keep refused because packing was open  and suggested me give this perfume to other its most ridiculous counter manager I talked to low quality in training to understand customers That young woman sales at side yelling she sold another perfume its disgraceful and such rude service attitude It is on 14 March 4pm
The anther day I called customers service center none picked up phone in five minutes its so shameful how this kind of store still run on business and the service is absolutely low and there is no after service such thing
If I going to plaza I more like to visit other small store instead myer its is just a name nothing worth to any customer to have look  Low stock out date display and low customers services on sales
I ordered on the 11 Feb now 24 Feb still not here cheap price poor delivery service
It gets to the stage where you think actually next time I will pay more and go elsewhere
My son is been waiting for it for Like 10 days now And we havent received nothing Every day his asking for it
Lyft is not nice and all All of this customer service crap they yell and stand by is clearly not true Ive been using lyft for a while and it has been ok The account that I use for my miscellaneous work activity was compromised and was OVERDRAWN due to a reoccurring fee I DID NOT TAKE THESE RIDES AND I ENDED UP PAYING FOR THEM OVERDRAFT DRAFT FEES AND ALL I have emailed and emailed and have tried to resolve this issue with Lyft and they NOT ONCE have contacted me back regarding this issue On top of thatmy lyft account is frozenclosed and i cant even use it Hmmmmi wonder why Seeing that no one has contacted me backhow is it possible That tells me that someone saw the MULTIPLE EMAILS and took THEIR action without contacting me They will contact you regarding AAANNNNY other issue jusy not this one I at one point even signed up to drive for lyft bc i thought the company was top notchNOPE Lyftyou guys suck I hope youre reoccurring charge is worth doing people dirty and not trying to help the situation
Why pay seat assignment fee if they dont guarantee seating What they call the airline and pass on your request for 15 
Hell I can do that for free
Save your money and order directly from a local florist The pictures shown on Avas Flowers website are not even close to the actual flowers you receive They are in business to collect orders and then broker them to local flower shops I ordered a specific flower shown on their website and then received a call shortly after placing the order saying the flowers were not available and they asked if I was ok with receiving a beautiful replacement I asked what the replacement flower would be and they started dancing around the question They offered me discounts on my next order or farm fresh flowers shipped later but could not tell me what the replacement flower would be I asked if they could call the local flower shop to confirm what the options would be before I made my decision They repeated the script for discounts and farm fresh flowers I asked them to cancel my order since they were unable to provide the goods and services that they sold me and thats when I was told I would have to pay 1399 to cancel my order I asked to speak to a manager and was told that they were all too busy to take my call After hours of hold time and several phone calls their cancelation department agreed that I would not be charged Avas Flowers in my opinion is a bad business and I would not recommend anyone to purchase flowers from them In the end I called a local flower shop asked if they dealt with Avas They said no and suggested that I search for Avas Flowers on social media to get better feedback regarding the company Do not let the ratings on Avasflowerscom fool you I have contacted my bank to dispute the charges that were supposed to be canceled
After writing a negative review with Trustpilot my review was removed by Avas Flowers by stating I was not a customer By providing my order number to Trustpilot hopefully my review is posted
They have commercial on TV 7 piece living room set for 398 and show many styles But when we get there the only one in deal is an ugly green couch that may look good in college dorm That happens every time That is my only issue Sales people are nice and still make a deal with us but not much of a selection for our budget
Booked car in Barcelona airport arrived to collect my car and girl told me my contract was cancelled no explanation Had to rent with much higher price with other company Avoid at any cost 
update i see reply from Goldcar and want to clarify that i provided all papers required at the till but was told the system cancelled my order no reason was give only excuses
this was my first time ordering from here today I placed my order and tried to pay with PayPal it did not take any payment I then chose to place an order again with a credit card and they took the order price from my card but I still havent received my order invoice with my order number and tracking details very upsetI sent a email to them and havent heard back yet please help why didnt I get an invoice when you charged my card the total price of my order how do i know when the item is shipped when I didnt even get an order number 
I placed my order on the 21st The very next morning I called my doctor to send the RX for exactly what I had ordered I even received an email from health warehouse about how they had received the RX that day I go to my order tracking and it still says the order was just placed 3 almost 4 days later It also doesnt show that RX that they said they had received so I can tell if anything on it was wrong I sent a message to them more than 24 hours ago and havent received anything back It worries me that I have no idea what the problem is or if I will ever receive my order when this is a medication I take everyday and will be without it now And they charged my account the very second I placed my order even without the RX so I am out that money for who knows how long without what I ordered Not happy at all
I bought dolce vita from dior website and after two days I got an email that they dont have itVery disappointed
Hi
I am so happy to get this review I hated my experience with this web sight I would not shop on here if it was the last retailer on earth Between having orders cancelled a number of times you have lost significant sales because of this to receiving 3 of the same orders and having to take my time out to return them to receiving items I did not order and then told in a rude abrupt manner I was stuck with them I dont know how this web sight stays in business
As a consumer and a fellow human being I am shocked at the behavior especially in these economic times
Thank you for listening
Christopher Pisciotta
they dont want me to remove my account DONT go on it
They said that they dont steal my account but yes they do if they dont want to delete my account
after 6months problems with are internet on the phone over hour a day was talking to diss Liam guy that did not want help whats so ever and just said Im hanging up on you now and did too I thought sky was bad eir is a pure joke STAY AWAY FROM EIR
I have been using Groupon for many years and mostly use it for local services This time I used it to purchase household items One item from the order was delivered while the second item is marked as delivered but I never received it and neither did my neighbors I asked Groupon to ask their vendor either to ship another set of items or just refund me for that portion of the order I kept getting a copy and paste of the same response which was not at all helpful  now I dont have the product I ordered or the money I spent on it
Disappointed because I dont have them yet
I do not know who writes those reviews but it is by far not the real situation The only thing they try to do is sell you support The most frustrating company ever will never deal with them again
At the check out I was forced to select 499 for next day delivery as the cheapest option which I didnt need Then when proceeding to payment another 5 was added to the delivery apparently due to my postcode So there I am 999 for postage I still wanted the goods so I proceeded anyway however I placed the order on the Friday evening and the goods didnt arrive until the following Wednesday So much for the 999 for next day delivery
Now you are charging for on demand TV shows without a doubt the bottom of the pile for procedures
If you can live through the Install it is the best network BUT dont call them for support They are the bottom of the pile when it comes to procedures its not the employees it is Backing Ridgeand the rules
Mediocre sales for crappy games I buy rarely It also doesnt allow us to quickly scan bundles If I want to know how many are coop games or online multiplayer has achievements cards or anything I have to click on every individual game It should be listed under title without needing a single left click Then I can quickly scan and decide if its a bundle I might use or a bundle that I wasted a dollar on and will never use Because the bundles are so large I am often demotivated to scan every individual game so I pass instead
As for the actual service though it works how its intended and can be trusted even with my card information stored It emailed me to make this review like it will help them gain sales It wont What will is cleaning up their garbage cluttering their sales
The glove rolls up  needs a wider band with a no slip on the inside When it rolls up it cuts off circulation to the hand I have tried 3 different ones none worked
Spoke a little too fast didnt explain the process and I think he should have given more options when I asked who I was calling it wasnt enough detail
a 15 charge that came up only after completly reading the folliw up rmail was a sneaky thing
My credit card is charged after returning the car  Enterprise partner rental cars at Krakow airport They charge for a missing parking ticket  krakow airport There was no instruction for this parking ticket in advance so how to know what to do with this But because of logic thinking I did return this parking ticket together with the keys But there was no one  the Enterprise desk to receive the car keys and check this parking ticket
30 euros were charged on my creditcard because they say it was not there And despite many emails to the service desk of Rental cars and their partner Enterprise my complaint gets no response and is being denied Very bad service
I reserved a unit but when I drove directly there to see it there was no unit like that Bait  switch Maybe
after trying to cancel the repair kit and get my money refunded  because I have never used the programme  and Emailing them for over a week  also trying to Phone customer services  I am getting no where so now it is time to take things further  YOU HAVE MY MONEY AND I AM NOT USING YOUR SERVICES  I AM ONE VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER AND DISGUSTED
Lied to us about insurance that we had prepurchased
The car we requested was unavailable and we were offered a downgrade with no compensation
Then they miraculously found a car
Then we were kept waiting for 45 minutes as the supervisor had left the desk in the hands of new staff wearing trainee badges
Just a debacle
Unbelievable I can not find the possibility to delete my data on your service I definitely want to chance and remove my account
Avoid this company at all costs
They will get you interested with cheap prices up front then sting you with extras You wont get your car back until monies paid so youre stuck They are also without doubt the worst customer care I have ever experienced they do absolutely nothing for you and investigate nothing
Love the fact that a low rating on Trust Pilot is suspiciously quickly followed by a 5 star rating and glowing report When is someone going to properly investigate these Cowboys
This was the worst fing hirecar experience ever
Not only was downloading the app and trying to get a copy of the voucher a fing nightmare but so was europcar kiosk
Then they charged us extra money when we booked full insurance with you They said we didnt have insurance
What a fing joke
0 out of 5 stars
Clothes are cheap and thin overpriced I have been trying to cancel for 2 years cant get through on the phone to cancel so I have to skip every month and if I forget then Im charged They dont even send an email anymore at the first of the month to remind me to skip or buy an outfit I want out and will never purchase again
Returned a product and was never refunded
Our pre booked booster seat was not there then took 30 mins to be delivered and installed There was a bag of food scraps in the boot and it was obvious the car had not even been vacuumed there were lots of hidden fees and we ended up paying the same rate as budget or avis without the streamlined service Just not worth it
I have purchased 3 tickets for inter vs milan football game it said its an Eticket which can be downloaded and they it will be ready 2 months before the event its been 10 days since I bought them and less than 2 months before the event and didnt receive anything I tried contacting them by email again but no response they dont have a contact number or any type of customer service and at the end I didnt get my tickets Ill contact my bank and see if theres anything they can do I do NOT recommend this website to anyone Fraud
They emailed me saying the tickets will be ready on the 22nd of Feb they gavr me a specific date and now when I reviewed them on this site they changed their words and said 48 hrs before the event Liars and unprofessionals
We booked a flight months in advance About six weeks before our departure my wife got a voicemail from someone who could barely speak english telling us there was a problem with our flight and asking us to call a 1800 number Couldnt even make out the name of the company she said she was calling from Sounded like a scam but just in case we called Flight Hub using the number from their website
Turns out they had to rebook our flight We now have to leave the night before and stay in a hotel in Toronto overnight AT OUR COST We refuse and they act like were being unreasonable They say a manager will call back by the end of the day Never got a call back so we called again They refused to provide any help at all Again they acted like were being unreasonable because we dont want to pay more because of their screw up Not even to mention the inconvenience of leaving a night earlier we have young kids were now going to have to rearrange baby sitting
So my wife hangs up and calls West Jet directly They were super helpful and offered to cover the cost of our hotel right away At least some companies have good customer service
Doesnt even have a real contact number to contact the actual location  I wouldnt dare do business with a company that a cant get ahold of  so unprofessional  Even the voicemail didnt have a accurate website
I am absolutely disgusted with the service of cab force Me and my wife arrived at Dublin airport with our transfer no where to be seen We searched the whole building asked every transfer person and taxi stand but none of them was ours We tried to phone the number on our voucher but the number didnt exist we had no other way of communicating with cabforce or the driver so after 45 mins being in the arrival hall we had to pay to get a normal taxi outside which cost us 35 euros
We will never use this site again and I would recommend everyone thinking of using this service to look elsewhere
During the process of setting up until the moment till closing the account this company has turned out more expensive and more careless then I would have ever imagined Returning questions with completely irrelevant templates etc Having worked with providers that keep the money in your own currency before I never would have thought that 2CO would come up with the ridiculous idea of converting it all to USD against worst exchange rate ever 15 international transfer before transferring it back to you in your own currency again with the worst exchange rate 15 So far my average costs for each payment have gone up to 189 of the sale this includes the 20 wiring fee Now that I want to close the account they require me to fill out a US tax form My company is located in Peru and sells only in Peru I do not want and did not ask to have the US USD or the US tax office being involved anywhere in the whole process
I put in the order for the contacts I was wondering what was taking so long to approve the contacts since I had provided everything that they needed with the prescription I waited a couple more days and decided to call When I called he told me my prescription was expired and it wasnt I had many months before my prescription to be expired Then I had to wait a while before I received the contacts I will never order from this company again
Salesman was a minimalist
No answers to any questions without asking again and again
Still havent received the material and still no answer from the sales representative
Not much to say  hoping it will show up This review request is the first Ive heard back from them
I tried to promote the sale of my surplus Matilda tickets but I could not find any way to link to my tickets
They eventually sold when I lowered the price but the sale never progressed beyond payment pending
Seven days after the actual event the money appeared unannounced in my bank account
bad bad exprerience
Didnt receive a product I purchased  never received a response back
No flexibility limited communication  unwilling to help
Edit after they replied  I already did email you you didnt reply This is the bad service I am talking about
Advertised 15 off on my order Koba restraint Was not applied
Seen your reply and cant comment directly beneath it but if you google koba portmarnock as I did you will see the advert which reads First Timers get 15 Off Order Online Delivery 3045 min So no it was not mentioned on the advertisement
It seems that dos the work and they received the benifits
When you need to wait one whole hour for 3 minor products its saying something
The website is slow and jumpy It is difficult to see items and it becomes very frustrating when your trying to view the items Your redeem points dont get applied and once I use my credits I am not using fabletics anymore The clothes are of an okay quality you have to become a VIP if you want to get your moneys worth Make sure you skip your month if you dont want to be charged This is how you get roped into spending money
I have always used rentalcars for all my travels overseas Things usually go well as the website is user friendly However my recent trip to Washington dullies proved otherwise My flight from San Francisco to dullies was delayed by a total of 24 hours and I informed rental cars via their online chat service The first thing I was told was that nothing can be done and my rental will be forfeited even though I had paid in FULL already The online sales associate was very unhelpful and mentioned that since I have signed the agreement I should have read it and not sign if I did not agree The sales associate proceeded to type with exclamation marks I was never rude in my dealings with the sales associate and I believe there should be a log of the online chat service
Only when I contacted thrifty myself did I get things sorted out
In todays world with so many car rental options I will stick with other safer options and not rentalcars Tried tested but failed I will never use rentalcars again
I chose Avas Flowers because of the rating online The flowers arrived
two days after I ordered it  late and neardead withered The balloon
which was supposed to say Happy Birthday as I requested was a
deflated smileyface Grossly disappointing frustrating infuriating
embarrassing humiliating is how I felt UPS was hired to make the delivery
Maybe the packages the specialize in crushed the balloon and the
flowers in which case the should have been to the florist One star for
the chocolate candy and the teddy bear two days late
Paid 1000 for the first phase they knew I had a tax lien and I was told that they could remove it in the first phase and when I turned in all my documents I turned in all these documents only to say I needed to pay them more money How can I pay u when im not getting a check Then they told me I needed to lean on a family member to pay them not the IRS Then the rep said the IRS wouldnt negotiate bc I missed the deadline You want more money  I owe the IRS thats why I called u and Im not getting a paycheck This service is for people that dont need their services
We was book whet them a package for holiday and we was waiting them
For a 3 days to confirm the package for fly and we ting the Expedia is better then them
Five days ago I purchased an espresso machine from Amazon However I cannot receive the package because Amazon has chosen Purolator as a carrier These guys cannot deliver anything except probably when you catch them on a street This horrible service completely negates all the benefits of online purchases because you would have to fight with the delivery company for an extended period of time just to get your package My advice to the consumers bying online from Amazon  please make sure that the package will be delivered NOT by Purolator
I found the whole experience too messy Proposal form asks any claims and I said no It did not ask if I had claimed off another party My car was rear ended three years ago For someone who has a full licence 25 years no claims against no convictions and no penalty points I found I was treated badly Too much communications afterwards implying I told lies
I would never have approached your company had I known what I was letting myself in for I dread the experience if I should be unlucky enough to need to make a claim
I booked a hotel with this company and received all the confirmationMore than a week later receive another email telling me my booking has been cancelled but there is a button to re book same hotelWhen you push the button price is nearly three times as high as the price I booked atEmailed them and asked for an explanation and got a reply saying basically get in touch with the hotelPhoned them on an expensive phone numbertook 15 minutes on hold to speak to someone and was told she would phone me backThis was two days ago and still waitingHave since booked another hotel with another companyWould never use bookingcom again
Flowers were delivered day before mothers day despite the fact I specifically asked and payed for delivery on the 26th which resulted in my mother accepting the delivery on the Saturday so surprise RUINED
Flowers were sparse bruised flowers made to look fresh and healthy on the website I am beyond upset at what i had to present to my mother as I had no time to go and get another bouquet which I could have just got from tesco that would have been a large FAR CHEAPER selection that actually looked fresh and healthy
I would recommend choosing another company so as to avoid disappointment on special occasions
1 I ordered from Avas flowers initially because I thought they were a local florist where my sister lives Turns out their website just picks up whatever city you google making it look like they are local they are NOT
2 I ordered a flowering plant basket delux with a card and balloon for delivery on my sisters birthday  a MONDAY
3 I received a call telling me that they had no designer available for the basket but they would upgrade my order to 24 roses and would add in a box of chocolates I said OK
4 Then I received another call telling me my order was processed and would be delivered Saturday  to insure it would be there for her birthday
5 Despite multiple calls to the company they said they could not change the delivery date because the order was already at UPS  which is how I realized they were not local I did not want the flowers delivered early because I wanted them to arrive as a surprise for her birthday on her actual birthday
6 Turns out the roses were delivered Saturday  upside down  and my sister was away for the weekend When she returned home Sunday evening to find the upside down bow flowers wilting the chocolates but no balloon
I will NEVER EVER order from these people again This has been the worst ordering experience I have ever had  and I am over 60 Ive also never written a review like this before
Update based on Blumbergs response This is a deeply disappointing and manipulative response At no time did your agent respond in ways that were clear timely or made sense If you think so based on the email interactions I understand exactly why your service is so bad
I was referred to them by my CPA The person at the CPA was so appalled by my treatment by Ana at Blumberg Excelsior that she took over the remainder of the interaction and finished getting what should have been 2 days of work but instead took 3 weeks They repeatedly ignored my emails and when they did respond they did so in ways that made no sense or ignored information I had provided Completely incompetent and dismal
I ordered tickets on this website for an ACC Tournament game I specifically ordered tickets with a section and seat number at a premium so that I didnt have to deal with the uncertainty of the GA tickets When the tickets came in the mail they were General Admission tickets This is not ok I am going to report this and ask for a refund because I would never have purchased these tickets
I have a business account with British gas Not only are they expensive they try to rip you off whenever they can
Id given them my last meter reading and they sent me the final bill but then revised the bill and added more than 200 units to it They didnt mark it as an estimated reading it was marked as an actual reading They apparently read the meter on a Saturday It did not happen because they have to be inside the shop to access the meter and nobody entered the shop No Nobody else had let them in because there are only 2 of us who answers the door when the shop is not open and neither of us had opened the door to this ghost meter reader British gas if you wanted to make things up please check the day of the week and whether you do have access to the meter without anybodys knowledge
I AM ABSOLUTELY FUMING
The low mark is because this cabin isnt listed accurately Its a 2 bedroom plus a loft space with a bed This makes a difference if the person in the loft doesnt want to be woken up by people in the kitchen or living room You shouldnt call something a 3 bedroom if it doesnt have 3 actual bedroom Cabin was clean check it in and out was fine
This is the second time Ive placed an order with Kill Cliff and the second time somethings been messed up I placed my order on March 7th for their green Kill The Quit St Pattys tee and every time I clicked the shipping link it said itd be here 316 Lo and behold its 316 the link STILL isnt live for tracking and theres no shirt This is on top of my last order with them where I ordered a tank for my wife they didnt have it but never felt the urge to tell me they no longer had it or refund the moneyuntil I called 3 weeks after I ordered
Second time is the charm
Horrible post sales support
I bought several orders of socks from Groupon in different patterns They sent the wrong pattern on one order When I clicked on the return button it says Non returnable but apaperwork in the package says for returns contact groupon I emailed them through the groupon system days ago and have not heard anything This is unusual for groupon Hope it is not a sign of customer service slippage I ordered a pattern of reindeer socks and was sent A heart pattern instead
I checked the dates for my vacation and was led to the amoma website I was surprised their rate was much cheaper than every other website I quickly booked only to receive confirmation for dates I did not choose I realized the website corrected my dates to fit their cheapest available rooms I contacted them to correct the problem and cancel within 5 minutes of confirmation I even tried to change the dates only to have the price jump way up past the competing websites Amoma kept my money for the room What a sneaky way to steal money from people change their dates than not issue refunds I will never use this website again and beg you to choose a different route as well
Need more items that are not out of stock
I purchased some invitations cards and the print wasnt what I expected
It didnt have that shiny look that I was looking for even though I paid extra for it
Also the website should have an option for free delivery if someone doesnt need their cards in a rush
Give to me time 24 48 hrs but it actually to whole 1 week cant believe
I love Kate Hudson and was excited to check out her Fabletics line especially when I heard it was targeted for women of various sizes including curvy bodies However Ive been logging on for a couple months and rarely find my size L in stock for the items Id like to order  disappointing Today there was a Presidents sale going on and a few items I liked were in stock in my size 4 of the 15 I looked at but the checkout experience was VERY frustrating
First each item in my cart had a discount yay but when I clicked to complete my order it said some items were no longer available  rather than the site removing them automatically it sent me back to do it myself boooo From then on the discounts were no longer applying for the remaining items until I removed them all and started from scratch readding each item one by one Finally when I was going to give up the page refreshed and said Signatures Items 50 off limit 4 per person so I clicked on the Signature Styles page but only some would reflect the discount in my cart  UGH I finally ended up calling customer service and they were to manually apply the discount for me in order to convince me not to give up on the entire purchase
I live in a small town where there is limited shopping so I primarily shop online While Im still willing to give this site 1 more shot next month Im disappointed to admit that this was one of the most frustrating shopping experiences Ive had
When we asked the cruise specialist to replace one child member with an adult member in a booked Quad Cabin they asked us to pay the price of 4 adult cabin plus 25 name change fee which was fair enough however also asked for 7321 extra
Ive emailed them a screenshot of the price on their booking page and the step by step calculation of the cost for clarification purposes
Ignoring everything that Ive asked them to clarify they insisted upon the extra charge and said The price you see on the website is on a different promotion However the websites wording has not been changed Where did this different promotion come from
We feel deeply that we were treated unfairly and feel frustrated with these cruise specialists
Please be cautious
Car was not good at all
Faulty online system parcel never turned up no one to complain to I actually tried 10 different numbers and even spoke to DHL who agreed that this company is horrific and they get customers complaining all the time Please avoid at all costs I have submitted a complaint which got resolved without them even contacting me They are holding my parcel despite it being arranged for delivery on two occasions and no one even showed either time Got through to some dodgy number and a person called STEVE was so rude He was laughing didnt send the email as requested and didnt let me log the complaint or talk to anyone AVOID AT ALL COSTS No one has contacted me despite my 4 attempts today
Weve found Five9 relatively easy to work with and responsive We had chosen their product based on ease of use and feature set and we still think its a well designed offering and we make heavy use of their builtin lite CRM contact manager But we just keep having problems with calls Calls being dropped or not connecting network interruptions etc This has caused some issues with our clients and has caused our call center staff to spend a disproportionate amount of time troubleshooting problems not to mention our IT staff
I have waited 7 months before posting a review to allow a fair opportunity for Optical Express to respond to complaints I had lens replacement surgery in July 2016 After 2 weeks I developed a problem and was sent to Leeds then Manchester to have further surgery After taking time off work to attend these appointments I was informed nothing could be done for 3 months and they didnt know why I had been sent there I have been advised to buy glasses from the pound shop 3 times After spending over 5000 to not wear glasses I really dont feel this is appropriate advice I have now had YAG laser surgery although at my last appointment in Leeds there was no record of this and it said left eye no surgery on the computer screen Record keeping and communication between clinics obviously isnt a priority as I have also been told twice that appointments need to be paid for even though I am still in aftercare period I have twice been told I need laser surgery but then nothing has been done My eyesight is now worse than before surgery Optical Express say 2020 vision or your money back I have not got 2020 vision and I think its a fair bet I wont get my money back either So in conclusion would I recommend surgery That has to a be personal decision after weighing up the risks Would I recommend Optical Express That unfortunately has to be a resounding NO It would appear that as long as surgery goes well then the service provided is good If problems develop then Optical Express simply do not want to know
Edit Interesting to note that there has been no response to this review
I have tried to phone clinical services but no answer I had to use the online text service and request a call back To be fair they did then call back within 2 hours I am now waiting for a review by the consultant
I sourced miniinthebox through an exhaustive Google search for a particular light socket that Id have to order through my local hardware The web site stated that orders are shipped from Canada all prices Quote d in CDN with Canadian flag displayed and accepted PayPal payments which are two conditions for me to engage Also the site promotes free shipping I thought I would try you out and placed an order on Feb 17 considering free shipping and continued browsing the website over the next several days I received an email on Feb 17 stating that the 1 item order had been shipped I was quite impressed and noted hundreds of items I would be interested in I processed a second small order within the next few days for some LED bulb samples I have since accumulated a few other items in my shopping cart on the site I endure 4 emails a day spam and yet have still not received a single item Mar 16 What makes me most angry is how much time that has gone into this attempted purchase just to repair a lamp
Too bad for MiniInTheBox Im only out 47
I was hounded for almost a year to buy ink When I decided to give ink station a go the ink was not delivered and I still received an invoice for the ink Will not entertain the idea of referring ink station to any friends or family

I booked a vehicle in November 2016 to be picked up and returned at Copenhagen Airport in Denmark just before Christmas 2016
As I work and live in the Republic of Congo but still a Danish citizen I made the booking from Congo via our satellite that uses a server in Luxembourg
Everything was prepaid and I received the rental documents right away in Danish language
Arriving at the counter at Copenhagen Airport the rental company informs me that I cannot rent that vehicle as I am a Danish Citizen that kind of vehicle is only for people residing outside Denmark Nowhere during the online booking was I informed that the offer only applied to people residing outside Denmark neither did the rental documents state such either
I couldnt get a refund at the desk but was encouraged to contact Cartrawler which informed me that they had 20 working days to reply
A couple of days later I receive a mail where Cartrawler state that I have informed them that I am a citizen of Luxembourg and because of that are not entitled to a refund
I replied that nowhere during the booking process did I state that I was a citizen of Luxembourg and that in case I was why did they send me a rental agreement in Danish language
Some days later I receive a new mail that it was their system that anticipated that I was from Luxembourg hence I connected via a server in Luxembourg but they could not be held responsible for such thing I should have informed them that I was NOT a citizen of Luxembourg But as a goodwill gesture they would refund me 45 of the total amount I have paid
I kindly decline that offer in writing and they reply that they will need to look further into the case
The day after they refund me the 45 and I never hear from them again
Despite Ive tried to call Cartrawler several times but from Congo via satellite and cannot hang waiting for a long time I am still waiting for their reply
For that reason I cannot recommend Cartrawler neither give them more than 1 star which they do not even deserve nevertheless one lees company to consider for my next rental
I thought I was reviewing a company with whom Ive done business I did not want to receive emails from Trust Pilot
If you want people to complete your surveys dont send them spam afterwards
Not the best experience Ive ever had big companies should be more organized dont think I would recommend this company to any one I know
I had bought tickets with my husband who is now my exhusband but I did not know this was going to happen at the time I called and explained the situation and said that I still wanted to go home and see my parents but I wanted his ticket cancelled I said it very clearly and a few times to ensure that mine would not be cancelled as well The incompetent person I was on the phone with cancelled my flight instead of his On top of that endless fees were taken to the point where I got no money back from his ticket and I had to pay extra to make sure the ticket is cancelled and he doesnt end up sitting beside me on a 10 hour flight They were given really clear and specific instructions and it really was an unacceptable experience After waiting for 1 hour on the phone and talking to 4 different people the problem was finally solved after I had lost all of that money People who make mistakes on such a mass scale should not be working there
I waited  and waitedno show on first order Reorderedwaited and waited Finally after several weeks I received my order Never again
If I knew then what I know now I wouldve made a different decision
SpareFoot does nothing for you that you cant do without them Dont bother calling for info they use an international call center I was totally unaware that this is a cover company I thought I was calling direct to the company I was interested in Very frustrating to be duped by this sham company

I bought a Designer shirt and found out that another website sells it for nearly half the price  legitimate website
We ordered Senna Plus the Plus is an added stool softener We were sent plain Senna I called a month ago and spoke with David and he said he would call me back Then last week after a month we called back and spoke with Cheyenne and she said she would call me back the next day with a resolution to this problem still no return call I would not recommend doing business with this company as if you are sent a cheaper and or incorrect product than what you ordered they do not correct their mistakes
in eBay I saw lalaloopsy styling head not heavy the pap was 3899 and I spent hours looking for a particular object for my child I get to the page and you have to bid fin but

I paid for Homecare 400 with British Gas for many years
In february I got a blockage with the toilet
1 first engineer from Dynorod came and said it was a Saniflo not covered by Homecare
2 I paid Saniflo engineer No problem with Saniflo but blockage further in the pipe
3 7 more lots of Dyno plumber  drainage came and apart from superficial hoovering of the pipe nothing was done to clear blockage
4 rang BG again  was told that there was nothing they could do
So what was the point of having expensive insurance that cannot even do a simple blockage
I paid for a plumber and he fixed the problem for 150
I will not be buying any insurance from British Gas again  will advise anyone else to be beware of the promise big deliver little from them
A shamble of noncommunication between British Gas Homecare which is just an answering service and local Dyno plumbers  drainage who did not want to do anything less than easy Dyno plumbers do not merit the title plumber  a total cowboy outfit
I posted a review for a business I love and the review is not even showing The took it down for no reason at all
No one answers the phone when I call  Email reply keep referring me to the pdf files they have online but the pdf files are full of type errors instructions say one thing but graphics display another very frustrating to try to figure outand thats a lot of money for such poor service
The mobile phone wasnt new I didnt want it and they offered me 80 of my money which is illegal in the EU I buy a lot online and this was the worst experience of my life
I purchased tickets to an event and was notified by Corbin that there was a miscommunication with the saler and I had actually bought 10pm tickets instead of 7pm Corbin told me he would work with the saler to get me new seats to the 7pm Corbin called and left me a message with an update I called and left messages with Corbin 3 different times with no response I then called the main line and Chris assisted me He told me he would call me back with new tickets because the ones Corbin offered were no longer available Chris called me back and I confirmed the tickets He stated he would email them to me I received no email I left 2 voicemails with no response I left 2 voicemails with the main line with no response I finally got Quinton the day before my event I was very frustrated and he handled the call well He reviewed my tickets with me and stated that they were still for the 10pm Chris had given me the incorrect tickets for 10pm instead of 7pm which was the entire reason for the reissue of tickets Quinton told me he would call me before 5pm with different tickets Quinton called me at 3pm with tickets and I accepted He told me he would email me the tickets I didnt receive the email so I called back and Quinton confirmed my email address Quinton remained on the phone until I received the tickets Quintons customer service was my only pleasant experience with Ticket City I will not be using Ticket City in the future for any of my purchases

once again I place an order an important order for a Z6200 PSU without it the printer is dead
still awaiting delivery so decided to check my account digiprint only to find order still processing so I still have a dead printer no delivery and waited a life time on so called live chat
Yet again it appears to be an order where the item is out of stock yet they failed to notify me at any time of this instead making me have to contact them to find out
VERY POOR Time to find a new supplier I think
I want load a set if its 3 gb Loopmaster males that the download has brroken by 638 mb but ive paid 32 and become 30 from my download
My honest opinion  get a good look at the way you do business and stop ripping customers off You cannot take money without authorisation and I have already filed a complaint with the ombudsman Your customer service is shocking and dont know how to talk to customer or provide information
An absolute rip off
Sophia thank heavens that I didnt book my connection flight through Bravofly I still find your reasoning unacceptable With the original flight I would have an hour and 15 minutes to book in for the connection flight With the change of flights I only will have 30 minutes to go from domestic flights to international flights I phoned the airline to ask if 30 minutes will be enough time They dont think so and recommended that I do not take the 1525 flight
Good serivces provided
Purolator is the only delivery company I deal with that is unwilling to leave any parcel at the door to my flat A driver can be scanned in to my building from my phone when they arrive and there is video surveillance on site  so there is little reason to believe the package is unsafe in this location
The package is then sent across town to a reception centre full of other annoyed customers and apparently undervalued staff
I would almost prefer the driver take a swing at throwing the parcel up onto my balcony as opposed to dealing with Purolators central warehousing
A contact attempt has been placed to attempt to permanently provide approval for drop off at my flat if this is possible then I wont consider Purolator any more insidious than the other big courier companies review amendments TBC
By MobileFundcom website I ordered and paid by my credit card for 5 sets of TWIN PACK PowerUp 30 App Controlled Paper Plane each set 5249 and total 27944 including tax  shipping When I made this order its website show the products are in Stock and can Shipping now Later I received a Email to notice me they have not been able to take payment from my card due to security reasons and require I pay by PayPal
After I had checked my order in the company the order is PowerUp 30 App Controlled Paper Airplane but not TWIN PACK even though the total is still 27944 but each one is 2625 At the same time I fund the company cancelled my initial order and refund money to my credit card and also revised a more expensive order for each 3149 and total 32539 including tax and shipping
So I understand why can they not charge me money due to security reason Also whey they give me a link and ask pay by PayPal If I dont check my order and amount again and then directly pay by PayPal and I will pay over pay 4595
This company is untrustful They are doing false business I will company to government also

I bought tickets for Ireland Wales game which were due on 17317 and still nothing As were so close to game time Im naturally nervous these will not arrive on time
The online booking process is simple and painless but God help you if you need something additionally I had to change my flight and it was a nightmare The fees were expensive which I understand 175 total on a 227 flight But simply to cancel and rebook a flight for the next day it took over an hour and a half on the phone In my mind this is completely unacceptable and a waste of time The first agent hung up on me accidentally and then never called back The second put me on hold for 35 minutes and then came back on the line more than 20 minutes later And the fact that I even had to call to do this is archaic since it could easily be done online Overall terrible
Product great Service great will use again
Arrived at 830am finally finished installing tires at noon Building itself is disgusting several holes in walls and generally filthy
Service took forever and my car sat completed for a long time until I asked for the third time what the status was Price was more than I thought I would be paying as well
Fees for Ticketmaster are not transparent or upfront and rather steep  On transparency refer recent Federal Court decison on Virgin  Jetstaar online drip pricing decision One would thinkl that if sellers were genuine in removing risk of scalping they would not be keeping people out of the market with gouging a profit from resale
I bought the nonauthentic ink for my Canon printer It is the worst ink I have ever used The ink is not printing properly after the cleaning etc and it has been a complete waste of money
I ordered a clutch kit for a cb900 An entire clutch kit was shown in the picture Metal plates aprings friction discs I thought I was getting the whole kit but only the friction discs showed up The fine print said not all kits complete but of course they never said This kit not complete So I ended up paying twice as much for a set of friction discs
Bought 100 golds at Elysium Other day I got banned I would be careful buying from these if I were you
I ordered my wife Valentines Day flowers and they did not deliver the correct flowers I called teleflora and explain what happen They refused to refund or deliver correct flowers but they offered me a 10 discount on future order  I told them that was unacceptable that I paid a lot of money for these flowers I even upgraded to the deluxe bouquet and vase  I told them I wanted a full refund or deliver the correct flowers to my wife They gave me a 10 refund and said I could accept that  or nothing They were very rude and uncaring I feel like they ripped me off and theres nothing I can do about it
Ended up ordering the replacement antenna online by myself because it was after hours when the guy finally called me back Once I attached new antenna it ended up being defective as I later came to find out the solder had cracked where the antenna is attached to the cable  no one will help me replace it

If youre going to show me a soft mattress cover that comes with my 4000 bed give me one I received a plastic crinkly one that has to be used else my warranty is voided also was 100 When I talked to the manager she was not helpful Basically said there was nothing they could do so I returned it I wont come here again Brighton location or any other Gardner White They just want the sale they dont care what happens after its made
The wines offered are disappointing For approx 20bottle I can get much better selection from Specs and I get to choose I am seriously considering unsubscribing from the club and share my experience with others
I was buying copper fit knee braces that supposed to be extra large  When I received them they are either a medium maybe a large but I doubt it instead of going through the aggravation of sending them back Im wearing them as calf braces Very unhappy with the purchase 
Pancake mix  not pancake just horrible smell Horrible Took hours to get the smell out
Costumer service  Why does it excist in this company
They do not know or want to give you service Be careful to contact them it can cost you more than you expected You need to take time and read everything about the business first before contacting costumer service
Really strange business
To chat We have been in contact almost since a month when You could have informed me and sent inportant linkes But wich instead resulted for me to pay for an expensive shipment carefully packed in bubbel plastic from Sweden to UK when the cheapest for me would have been to not contact You and just throw away the unopened pancake mix also  And now a phone call I really do not feel like paying anything for that also  Please 
My last purchase did not work 8 mo and no sound  I ask for the refund
if im being honest i am more than disappointed in the options i was given
I transferred USD to THB thai Baht  5000 and received 1500 baht less than doing it through bank of america I sent same amount of  on the same day
I think that transferring to THB the thai banks give a good exchange rate that these guys cant match when someone is transferring a desirable currency
Conclusion stick to your bank unless it is a small some of money or if you have a large sum try and negotiate a good rate with one of the other companies that will vary the rate depending on amount
What they dont tell you is that you have to buy their 20 lock plus insurance iwas not expecting that much money you should really tell people this before they get there
I invest with Monex more than two years ago more than 50 value of assets are gone It is lost with all wrong decisions reps are not trained enough every time a wrong decesion and you hard earned money disappear I will have more money in my account if I had in a regular savings account atleast I can use it with this investment account I dont know when I will have my principal back to hell with profit I will appreciate if I get my money back people dont invest with them be careful with your money they only work hard to loose it not adding it to your portfolio Stay away from the investments just buy the gold only and they are good with that No Invetments with Monex do it only if you dont need your money back
I first logged on to just look and was forced to enter my information All I wanted to do was look so I gave an old unused account I logged on again today to show my daughter who I wanted to buy a birthday gift for Upon checking out I was shocked to see that I was getting a free 1 year subscription to Sports Illustrated and there was no way to refuse it Also I was dismayed at the thought of having to opt out of a purchase every month or have my account charged every month This is absurd I almost didnt order I will make sure I check my email and skip If I like the product I will order again In the mean time I will compare store prices and styles and decide if this membership being stuffed down my throat is worth it
you have to improve your cervices there is something wrong when we try to make a ticket Sometimes we make a reservation but they didnt send the tickets and after the time gone they sent an email and said we cant make a ticket because your credit is declined although that is not through
Placed an order for a serial code 5 days later still havent received it Paypal shows transaction went through and PlayAsia have received the funds Customer disservice still saying they cant find the payment
AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS Inept dishonest and pretty sure products are counterfeit
Reviews misleading U know when i bought this what I intended to use it for and I wouldnt choose ur product over something I used in highschool when I couldnt rub 2 pennies together

Ordered a part It was the wrong part and they would not let me return it Had they let me return it I would have spent 1000 on a new espresso machine
Was signed up for the VIP membership without selecting anything for basically 50 per month Tried live chatting with a rep 12 times over the course of 3 hours and did not hear back at ALL Finally decided to call spoke to a robot for 20 minutes before they forwarded me to a rep but I was hung up on Tried again and was finally able to speak to a real person Received a confirmation email that my VIP membership was cancelled and they cancelled my order all together Based on these reviews I am going to bet I still continue to get charged for the VIP membership Any more charges and I am going to FLIP
So difficult to speak to someone Would not allow me to renew online Says on emails your open till 8 MondayThursday but when I called at 630 your closed When I requested callbacks at certain times I didnt get them
I thought I was going to love this service It was very easy to place my order and the pricing is great But so far my lenses have not arrived I received a delay notice but delivery is now several days past the delayed date of delivery 
Dont have list of restaurants available in area if the restaurant decides its too busy and your to far away when it suits them Very disappointing service from Wylam Chinese restaurant Cork
Bought Arcteryx Veilance product from them
They marked up US pricing to Canadian pricing 30 more  claimed discount of marked up Canadian price
Furthermore they did not take into account exchange rate difference in paying with USD Other Canadian clothing web sites that carry this line list price in USD which is always 30 less than Canadian price due to exchange rate They list pricing in multiple currencies
Called them on this  response was the price is the price Total lack of transparency  unwilling to do anything about this Wanted to return item  they were supposed to send return authorization which never came  I would have had to pay return shipping
Will never buy anything from them ever again
In the process of trying to get some simple answers to some simple questions I discovered their socalled Customer Service to be sadly unsympathetic and altogether evasive
In fact it was shocking they denied all knowledge of any connection with CouponCabin who had actually introduced me to them refused to honour discounts that had been advertised if an order had been placed by a certain date claimed that the Cashback I had received from CouponCabin and which had been refuted by them had in actual fact been paid out by FloraQueen  a total lie sounds like these two companies are in cahoots and finally they blocked my emails Even their feedback request was summarily closed  like they really dont want to know what you think of them a shame as there were some good things to say about the flowers
I was a returning customer but the combination of their agressive marketing techniques their dishonest dealings and the insulting attitude of their socalled Customer Services people has ensured that I will not be making use of their services in the future
The food was not good at all We served in an hour of delivery But started smelling already Few of my guests didnt eat it I will not refer anyone
Bravofly which is a part of lastminutecom is the worst company ever
I bought 9 plane tickets through them The plane was cancelled and i want my money back
Bravofly does everything possible to avoid paying the money back and now i has to use the legal system to make the refund the money for a journy they never delivered
My advise Never buy anything from them Buy your tickets directly from the airlinecompany and not from theifs and hustlers like Bravofly
Tricked  tricked  tricked  terrible spam type tactics
I am using phoneindia since past 0203 years and I give only 1 star due to followings
1 Phone India will change their prices without any information Sometime phone India keep same prices but reduce the monthly minutes without any information If you keep auto recharge they will deduct the money without informing that rates has been changed or calling minutSs are reduced This is like day light robbery
2 Recent times no web calling is possible in any of the webpages chromeexplorerfirefoxsafari etc
2 No PC app from phoneindia
3 No windows phone app from phoneindia
4 Access Numbers are only for limit countries No access number for the country I am calling from
Nul nul nul nul
Stinks that they fail to mention that they run your credit just to rent a damn car Not only that but the cancellation fee is horrendous Will never book through a third party again
Parcel  U20170223728743 Since 14 Feb and till today and the up coming days havent being shipped
They are very small I think one in china and one in USA
They say they have Paypal and thats not true they dont own a Paypal account at all I had to waste 80usd in transfer fee
They have only one employee in customer support and only reply 1 email by day although that they were at the beginning good
I have 3 parcel in the beginning I told them to put them in 1 shipment after 3 weeks of delay I told them to send the first parcel but they refused they say its being consolidated into one big package and that totally a big lie  How they know its one package the one who replied to me is in China and the goods are in USA  and also there is difference in time 
Totally disaster if you are going to ship with them

Spent over 65 to have flowersgifts delivered to my mum in France for the Saturday before mothers day They finally turned up today Monday late and after the event To add to the insult I was then offered 20 of my next delivery Do you really think Im going to use your company again after the service and compensation you have offered me I would not recommend this company to anyone unless you need to get flowers to someone after the event
I have listed five or six tasks with only one being completed A complete waste of time
It appears that people do not want to make offers even when they express interest in a task due to the 15 fee They all want to arrange the task off the books In my case several of these jobs were over 1000 I cant blame them for trying to maximize their income
Worst insurance company I have ever delt with 
Dont be fooled and drawn in by the cheap Quote  You have to pay to speak to someone over the phone if any issues with setting up your policy you can never get help when you need it 
I was charged 30 for 3 phone call back from them 
When I compared the policy to my last they actually cover very very little stay away at all costs 
I found the whole experience very stressful as I had to make many many calls and emails in order to secure delivery
BH is the Best place to shop for any you need  Always in stock and quick shipping
I was 10 minutes late for my appointmentinstall and I was told no install because you are late have to reschedule for 2 weeks from now I called the corp  and had them call the largo location to let them know I was running late It didnt matterno install I am concerned with retribution because I have to go back to that location in 2 weeks and I dont want to be punished for my review
I use Thalys twice a month and its fair to say that the wifi a joke Please do not communicate this as a USP because in reality its frustrating to find out your rebooting more than you should have been working
On my yesterday trip the 1234 from Amsterdam to Brussels got cancelled without any communication whatsoever
You get access to the next train but no guarantee for seating so not able to get any work done either Looking for alternatives
Be Careful with this people because if you dont get the insurance they try to sale you they will get you one way or another
Since December when I started my intoxalock account this company has overdrawn my bank account twice and has not once taken the agreed upon monthly payment out correctly of my bank account So out of four months thats two separate times they over drew my bank account and zero times my monthly fee has been charged correctly Understandably duis are a serious thing but the amount of time and inconvenience it has caused me is ridiculous Each month I have spent at very least 12 hours on the phone trying to rectifiy mistakes made on their part The people at the call center are respectful for the most part but nothing has been done to solve the problems caused by the incompetence in the payment department In my eyes they take advantage of the situation we are put in as a result of duis Customer service with this company is zero and in my opinion run by a bunch of theives
Misguiding students for making own profits
Very unprofessional staff and even the so called immigration consultants over there have got no idea about immigration process and SOL
I paid for the quicker delivery option and received no parcel I had to chase up the order and it was dispatched the following day Resulting in getting the parcel days after I should have received it
On receipt of the t shirts I opened the parcel and immediately I was disappointed in the overall quality of the product The cut of the t shirt is poor the quality of print is even worse and the sizing is far from the medium I ordered more like small to x small
These shirts are unusable and the whole experience has been very disappointing
The gal in the Philippines was great but I respect a company better if they provide jobs to American workers The online ordering process was a nightmare hence why I had to talk to the gal from the Philippines
I never received my certificate in the mail And its been over 7 business days
Bad customer service store never answers the phone I called for a week straight and still couldnt get thru I will never order from this company again
When I received the ink there were no instructions on how to use the cartridges ended up breaking two and making an inky mess Not pleased
The cartridges were not similar to HP No packing slip or return instructions either
They made a mistake and send me wrong bags and now I will be punish and not get the correct bags till I send this ones back to them like Im the one who made the mistake
Horrible Damage control tactics
So slow sending
This company just decide to put a limitation on your account at any time so you cant access your money for 180 days The reason for this is that they make money on interest while the momey is resting there You may think it will never happen to you as did i but they ruin lives businesses and relationships because of this and when you finally get in contact with them you are told tough sh1t Please STAY AWAY
I received wrong order and called and called and nobody answers the phone so I left an angry message I got an email telling me to send a picture of what I received the issue is not resolved yet My experience so far is a total disappointment and I do not think I will order anything else form this company They do not have a customer service which the pretend they have and you can never talk to a person They immediately say they are busy and wants you to leave a message

I live in Japan and I inquired and purchased by mail order method from Japan

VAT can not be billed when EUROs business operator exports to a business outside the EURO zone
But I reseived the FATTURA  and there is no mention and detailed breakdown of VIA by law
And the business operator of EURO is obliged to state VAT in the sFATTURA by law
In spite of Passion Vintage did not specify details of VAT but Settled amount including VAT by credit card transaction
So I thought that I cheated amount equivalent to VAT
I will inform the tax office of the Italian Republic
No Links provided for a NON FEE PAYMENT METHODForced to pay via credit card
they took my money and provided no service
Do not sell books through this company When books were sent to them they were all in good condition and reached there without the package being damaged However on two of the books they said they had water damage when in fact they were brand new books and coinicidently worth more than the other books They then supposedly disposed of the damaged books or did they really  This is how this company makes its money

Worst flight company and customer service I have come across
Booked for 3 flight to Dublin on Flybe and flight was delayed for 3 hours we chose not to accept this via email today is the seventh day and they are telling me to be patient I have rang on multiple occasions to an Indian call centre where the staff simply to do not listen and I am the one who is actually deaf
Its come to the point I will be seeking to speak to my bank as we have not received any service we have paid for
Quick to take the money absolutely shocking to do business with
BEWARE BOOKING WITH THESE
Delivery was quick but service was incompetent  this was a simple garden garage but came with no connectors for the frame which rendered it useless Basic failure in service and incompetent packing
Its worrying that they rely on application installers changing your home page and search engines in order to drive traffic They wouldnt need to resort to such underhand strategies if they had better content
I think the overall process was very easy and straightforward I chose this company because of the extra benefits such as 50 cashback when I joined the Lloyds business account However after almost 5 months  no cashback and now both Rapid Formations and Lloyds are refusing to pay the cashback even though both of the companies ensured me I would receive it NOT HAPPY Dont fall for their lies

Former tenant Someone broke in smashed a window of a bedroom and took all our possessions evaluating at AU 10000 The property manager would not show up until after hundreds of calls and onsite visits The broken window was not fixed until three months later
You can never contact the property manager If you call heshe always ask you to leave a message which heshe will never reply If you text heshe just ignores If you drop in onsite heshe is always outside office We experienced twice of changing property manager without any notice
Extremely bad experience Do not choose them
It should say one size fits most slim women Definitely too small for men even with small hands Very disappointing
Despite receiving an email confirming my order had been dispatched it never arrived I rang for an update but my call was not returned After a followup call I eventually learned that my order had not been shipped at all
On the plusside the order was then shipped the following day and has since arrived  within one week of actually being shipped
Took over a month to receive payment that was supposed to be direct deposited a week later Very hard to get in touch with

Ive been ordering through Itadka for over 5 years but since the rebranding to Red Rikshaw the services hasnt been the same  reduced delivery slots a lot more out of stocks reduced expiry dates on products
I am pretty convinced they have no intention of paying me for my iphone Have to ring up everyday just to get fobbed off on the phone by saying they will ring back Customer service is just awful
Apparently its with a manager now but they also havent come back to me
I am now 160 down thanks to this company The only reason i used them in the first place was because of the reviews Please do not use them Wish I had just sold my phone to 02 now
What I ordered is not whtat I received and the offer made on site for the free transportation was not applied
The shampoo which was supposed to resolve dry hair is not effective
I purchased a full bedroom suit and couch from Home Zone on 11217 and the furniture was delivered on 11717 In the process of bringing the items into my home the delivery company used a brick from my landscape to prop my storm door open so far it stressed the wood frame pulling out the screws and breaking the metal bracket to the closer and pulling those screws out The delivery company also installing the furniture damaged the dresser nightstand foot board head board and side runners of the bed frame with deep notches to hair line scratches I immediately contacted the store and was informed that I had to call the delivery center to speak with the Supervisor which I did right away The Supervisor asked that I text him the photos which was also done right away and he stated that he would get replacements out that coming Tuesday The Supervisor informed me that he would send the photos over to the delivery company as they are a 3rd party contractor and they would be in touch with me At 201pm that afternoon I received a call from the 3rd party company informing me that someone will be calling me within 48 hours to schedule a time to repair my door 22717 no word from the person who will repair my door or the 3rd party delivery company Later that afternoon on my way home from work I stopped by the store and spoke with the store Manager I informed him of what had taken place during the deliveryinstallation and he apologized I asked for the delivery fee to be refunded due to the issues and the store Manager informed me that I needed to wait 24 hours as the delivery company needed to close the ticket out before it would show in his system to be able to complete the refund I completely understood that The store Manager asked me to email him the photos of the damage which I did while sitting there and we confirmed they were received While speaking with the store Manager the delivery Supervisor called him to inform him of my situation although hours had passed During that call I explained that my husband or I could not miss work so we changed the delivery of the replacement furniture to be delivered on 22517 The store Manager said that he was sending the photos over to his Owner who would not be happy about the situation and he showed me the blurry dark photos that the deliveryinstallers took after everything was set up in my home and told me they were unacceptable photos that they submitted On 22117 I stopped by the store and received my refund back for the delivery fee and was informed by the Assistant Manager that he had very little information as to what was going on At 112pm on 22417 I contacted the store again regarding my door and the store Manager informed me that I needed to contact the delivery Supervisor regarding the damages I explained that Im not calling all of the other departments as this is their responsibility to resolve and not mine I was told that I would receive a call that afternoon back from the store Manager and never got a call I tried to call an 800 number that pulled up online for the Corporate Office for Home Zone as the store claimed they didnt have a corporate number to provide however the number online did not work I also called the Lewisville store to see if they could provide me with a number and they told me the best thing would be to call their customer care number however I havent been able to get anyone to answer there either At 521pm on 22417 I called the delivery department Supervisor to verify we were still on the schedule for the Saturday 22517 delivery of the replacement number but only got his voicemail so I left a message I never received a return call confirming the delivery On22517 at 1136am I called the store and asked for the store Manager who was with a customer so I could confirm the delivery and the gentleman on the phone asked me to leave a message I told him I would call back as no one every returns my calls I then called the delivery Supervisor who again did not answer the phone I called the store back at 1150am and left a message for the store Manager to call me back Around 115pm after not receiving any return calls I went to the store where I was greeted by both the store Manager and Assistant Manager Neither could provide answers and the store Manager stated that he was waiting on his Regional Manager to call him back In the middle of me continuing to complain for the lack of answers care or concern in regards to this matter the Regional called The store Manager stepped in a back room then came out and stated he was sending the photos to his Regional which I thought was done back on the 17th per our conversation The store Manager looked up the delivery schedule and informed me that the replacement furniture was not on the schedule for this day 25th as previously discussed therefore my son was still stuck with his room in a disarray I explained how ridiculous this had become and my son could not put up all of this clothing as we thought the replacement furniture was coming and we had already moved his mattresses again for the second time I asked why they couldnt deliver the replacement furniture and he stated because the schedule was already full I explained that the delivery department informed him that he would push someone on the schedule to make sure it was delivered The store Manager acted as if we never spoke of the delivery of the replacement furniture and stated that he thought the delivery Supervisor was setting that up with me I asked if the Regional could provide a depreciated value on the furniture that was damaged as that is something we would also think about as a resolution and the store Manager said he would mention that Everyone also still seemed surprised that I hadnt heard anything about repairing my storm door I told the store Manager that if the 3rd party delivery companys repair man did not call me that day then I would like a copy of their insurance to file a claim to get my door fixed I explained that the repair would be under 100 more than likely but if I needed to file an insurance claim on their policy then I would I was informed that the store did not have a copy of the insurance so I asked the store Manager to ask for a copy of it from the Regional After everyone was done pointing fingers at each other the store Manager stated that either the Assistant Manager or himself would call me by 6pm on Monday the 27th At 649pm on Monday I called the store because once again no one follows through with what they say they will do The store Manager was out and the Assistant Manager was busy I received a call about 10 mins later from the Assistant Manager apologizing for the delay however he didnt have any answers for me either I told him that I would be filing numerous complaints with different agencies to see if someone could help since they wont or cant I explained that I still hadnt heard from the repair man and the Assistant Manager asked for the number he provided me to the repair man for my door on Saturday I retrieved the number from my car and provided it to the Asst Mgr He said he was going to try to call him himself While typing this complaint at 744pm I received a call from the repair Supervisor who stated his guy tried to call me on the 20th but was told they had the wrong number and he was going to send me an email but he just hadnt done it yet He stated that his guy would be out tomorrow 228 to look at my door between 5 and 6pm to see what needs to be done to repair it also while typing this I just received a call back from the Assistant Mgr calling to confirm that the repair Supervisor did call me this evening and he just wanted to follow up I thanked him for doing that and for following up I find it amazing that after filing all of these complaints now Im being blamed for causing the damage What acrappy company
Swiched to energia in good faith after been told how great it was by energia sales rep I was told i would get 150 euro back or off my bills because i am switching Since i have switched i have received no contact from energia no special offers as advertised by energia and ill more than likely hear nothing back about this Word of mouth is a powerful thing
Ive been waiting FOUR MONTHS for my order Their website says its still shipping Ive messaged them through fb and their web page No response Horrible company Id give them zero stars if I could
I still have not received my order I ordered more than a month ago
The Bluetooth I purchased was disgusting It had ear wax on the earpiece and was covered in scratches Unbelievably bad experience
Car Flexi were the worst car rental broker Ive ever dealt with to the point where I would call them dodgy and they are verging on scam artists
Firstly the booking was misleading where they said full insurance was included we were then expected to pay an additional few hundred dollars upon pick up to actually get full insurance
But that certainly wasnt the worst of it The worst part was that my booking had no information on it And when I tried to enter the booking info into their online service it no longer appeared to exist Their website was completely down So I was in a different country with no idea where I was picking up my car I tried calling their various numbers The New Zealand number didnt exist Their Australian number didnt exist And the number in Greece wasnt functioning either I ended up calling as many car rental companies as I could find in New Zealand and still had no luck I had already paid a large deposit online upon booking Finally got through to the number in Greece They were able to tell me where my car was Id already spent most of the day making calls at my own expense
Then as mentioned when we picked up the car we owed a lot more money than what we were lead to believe
I made a number of written complaints asking for documentation and reconciliation They avoided any discussion about compensation sending various emails telling me to check my online booking They claimed not to understand what my requests were I wrote them at least ten times They never provided me with an adequate explanation and they certainly didnt compensate me for the time I wasted or for the additional  I spent
I find it hard to believe that a reputable car rental company would actually work with these dodgy brokers
Do not use them You will regret it
Put an order around Jan for Valentines Day
End up they force to pay another 25 dollars otherwise cancel your order Live chat seem like no one working do not recommend to get any product from them
I returned the vehicle with a FULL tank of fuel having called at a gas station on the way to the airport yet I was still charged a total of 66 as a fuel surcharge
I questioned this at the return point and was told by the Dollar agent that this related to an earlier fuel surcharge which I had paid This was correct as I had changed vehicles midway through the rental period at short notice and without the opportunity to fill the fuel tank
Needless to say I am not impressed with this situation and have lodged a Disputed Transaction with Dollar and my bank
I hired the car and it had 34 a tank of fuel  I stopped when i noticed it traveled 150 mtrs and rang them told them i took a photo of the fuel Gage and offered to return the car so they could see it  I was told its ok and they would fix it upon my returnI seen the return guy and he said it was all good  But the aholes still charges me 15 for the fuel and have not responded to any of my 15 emails  They have the money they dont care
Will never use them again or recommend a thieving company that doesnt care about there customers this just my opinion though
Wish I could leave a Minus5 star
My domain name was registered and in use for many years since 2002 and it was on autorenewal
GoDaddy cancelled its auto renewal without notifying me
In fact they had sent email earlier letting me know that the domain name would renew automatically In that email it says You made the smart simple choice when you selected autorenew The following domains will renew automatically on the dates listed below All thats left to do is enjoy your purchase
GoDaddy even did not try to charge my credit card to renew that domain name but they charged the same card for two other domain names few days before and after that date Without no other warnings or email sent they removed my domain name from my account because they had already received an offer from someone else
When I called their support they said they could help negotiating to buy it back from the new owner  thieves in my opinion 
I had 30 domain names registered with them now 29 I will move them all away from this company with such low ethics
The online service and rental rate was good My experience at the airport with Fox rental was horrible Long line surprise charges holding money out of my account hastle at the pick up place castle at the drop off place
Well I have been with Hablacuba now for a whileIve been mostly satisfied i should say and admitbut my last experience was not what I was expectingand I will explain whyi was promised to receive a 10 dollar free call to Cuba upon my purchase of recharge but I did never receive that and I consider that as a false advertisementplus upon my purchase I did not receive neither my usual bonus pointsso I wondering why If somebody can let me know why I did not receive what I was promised to I will immensely appreciate thatthanks
What can I say I ordered flowers on Wednesday evening for valentines day my wife then surprised me with a trip away Therefore not being at home on the 14th I tried to ring the company to either cancel or change the addressdate of delivery I spent 20 mins on hold gave up and contacted them my email I received an email later that day stating its a busy time so no amendmentsrefund even with 4 days notice In todays world of IT and management systems you would think a company would have the ability to track and amend orders as necessary So no refund no amendments what a waste of money Do not use this company
The iron on labels are coming off my daughters clothes They show them on socks and teeshirts however on any fabric with any bit of stretch they have come off partially or completely after just a few washes Weve followed the instructions to iron them on and wash in cold water so I dont see why they arent staying Im terribly disappointed
you people are fraudulent first of all you spring a credit card fee which comes up to more than 2000US at payment processing Then you dont inform your customers that your site is Canadian based and they will be paying at a Canadian exchange rateMy bank charges an 8 US fee for international purchases So unsuspecting customers are charged the prices in US then its converted at a Canadian exchange rate AFTER THEIR PAYMENT IS PROCESSED AND THEIR CREDIT CARD IS CHARGED MORE It is only after you see your itinerary or you get a notice from you bank of the purchase you realise you are charged more I ended up paying more than some of the other sites charged
My tickets initially cost 108600 after the credit card fees were added came up to 112106 and then after being charged at a Canadian exchange rate the final cost is now 114227 an excess of 5627 Other sites charge less than the 114227 I paid for the 2 ticketstI must say im disappointed you have just lost a frequent flying customer
Wow I am a merchant and received a negative product review from a customer who had not received any products from us as he had not paid for the order The customer was contacted to determine how we could assist him and if perhaps there was some mix up The wash up was he said he would think about paying for his order
We reported this product review as he the customer had not received and products from us Trust Pilot then offered the customer who had not ordered from us to give us a service review
We then receive an 1 star negative service review from a nonpaying customer who had not received any goods not any service from us except trying to assist and clarify with the customer a negative product review on products never received
Wow is all I can say I accept negative reviews if we have done something wrong  or the customer does not get a pleasurable experience but that is just rank
Customer Placed Order Customer Did Not Pay For Order We Did Not Ship Goods TrustPilot considers this providing a good or service How
I needed the parts fast but they took over and entire week JUST to process the order then another half week to ship
Booked in advance for Two month cancel my return trip and offer me other flight which I have to pay for transit airport and wasting my time at the airport Dont take any responsible just take commission
Should book directly with an airline if you know the ticket price
super unclear pricing
Sell what they dont have and lie about shipping dates
Drinks undelivered
Wanted to buy a phone as a birthday gift placed order paid with my credit card it got cancelled Emailed them for an explanation a semi automated email came back with very little information Replaced the order paid with my debit card this time it got cancelled again
The system would not let you pay with PayPal either
Not getting a gift for someone at the very last moment is not very convenient I would say stay away
I didnt get my parts still Spent quit a bit of money Customer service was lacking One man Josh was somewhat helpful Still waiting to hear back
I ordered a bouquet for my friends birthday and there were 3 old pink Roses that were hideous They filled the vase with Eucalyptus and 2 stalks of Babys Breath with one Random color of a Carnation it was the ugliest shiz Ive ever seen It looked like all the garbage flowers that were about to die ended up in this bouquet They charged me 100 a HUNDRED dollars for unwanted flowers I choose the deal of the day thinking that flowers that are in season will be better than the limited source that get shipped I was wrong This website is a ripoff You are better off ordering from a local Florist and detailing exactly what you want This company have no taste in arrangement and they are scammers They took my money and havent even responded 
Your rates are misleading I booked a car for four days unlimited mileage on reservation I arrived at pick up and was told that they do not do unlimited mileage for local residents and I could not go more than 120 miles a daywhy would I rent a car to stay in town only this was for a vacation weekendyour reservation ruined our plans NO rental car this was horrible experience I will not use outside company again
I put dares and then they change and there No phone numbers only text and no response
I had a spring clear out if old electronics and a few other items I had and decided to stick some on eBay Spent hours writing eBay items and uploading pictures everything seems fine So the items started ending and payments were made So I tried to book some parcels using my PayPal account Nope They have held MY money and want me to send MY items using MY money to pay the postage Are these primates insane I have held an eBay account for over ten years and have 120 I dont use eBay that much feedback from buying and selling in the past and they treat me like this Absolute joke Think long and hard before using a company like this they are absolute sharks No reply to messages confirmed everything they wanted to know etc But still my money is on hold I have held 3 expensive items back until PayPal release the funds or they can cancel the orders and ban me because they aint getting no more of my money  I would sooner let them rot in my attic for the next couple of decades
Rented a car from Autoescape  Avis All went well until car was returned and getting home The car rental firm was then pulling 120USD for something I have no idea what it was
Contacted Autoescape who said it was because of refueling I refueled the car at the airport and still had the receipt so sent it to them After 20 mails and 3 phone calls they still refused to put this money back and had an exceptionally bad attitude
I reported them to Mastercard for using my credit card without authorization and Mastercard reimbursed me
Such an inserious company without customer service should not be able to operate I am lucky I did not have to deal with an accident case with them
Stay far far away
My order was not complete I sent a mail about it No answer no nothing That is not a company I will suggest to anybody or buy something personally in the future Yes I am upset Thanks for the opportunity to write a review
Worst experience ever Just wanted to cancel my booking and they gave a hard time Lots of penalty on top of the airline penalty
I gave a good review but just now found it was deleted for no reason Dont know how you can do that It was my review from last year
Ordered a 800 groupset website said they will tell me when dispatched and tracking details didnt recieve any details had to chase them up then only to find that they had wrote the wrong address details on the package and that the delivery driver couldnt deliver due to this
i ordered a cable and it came the next day when it came time to write a review they sayed it didnt met there standard i took my time to write it i will pay a higher price somewhere else next time will never shop there again
Ill keep this brief but called to fix an order Grainger screwed up placed on very long holds 10 minutes and was hung up on twice The third time I called I was forthcoming with the rep and let her know Im frustrated and have been on hold them hung up on two different times I asked for the department number Ive been trying to reach and then she asked me why I was so rude and yelling at her which I wasnt yelling just exasperated tone On hold again for 10 minutes only to be told the request I was trying to make can only be done online and cant be done on the phone What a joke
I have never had any issue with Amazon and would recommend all businesses use Amazon as not only are they substatially less expensive their wait times exponentially less and staff much more professional
I struggled to see where I got a bargain here Any of the wines I have tasted so far in my pot luck case havent been great especially the Beaujolais Nouveau infact I didnt drink it because it tasted stale it was terrible Also from my research the wines that Ive had so far retail at circa 10 Staff were very pleasant and helpful though
You allow 24 hrs to cancel but if a flight is booked you cant alter within minutes nor get a full refund right away 68 weeks for a refund for a flight booked minutes prior too is just unacceptable I will never use flighthub again All I wanted was to change the outbound time as the lay over was 12 hours I was willing to pay the difference but instead I have to cancel entirely and rebook that makes absolutely no sense I rather pay more and go elsewhere and get proper customer service
It was easy to order the flowers online I ordered them at night and they were delivered to my friend in Luxembourg the next morning I was pleased with the quick service
However I am giving two stars only because the flowers that were delivered Pink Cloud for the birth of a girl did not remotely resemble the online product image The image was of pink flowers with minimal greenery and small white flowers The flowers that were delivered were pink light purple dark purple and yellow There was also a lot of greenery
I understand that the actual product may differ from the image depending on seasonal availability  but I expected most if not all of the flowers to be pink
Communication seems to be the fatal flaw of Ryonet Sure you could have the best product in the world but if the front doesnt work with the back everything in between fails I was promised the world to make a sale but not much held to be true I had to settle for a lesser product my order arrived two weeks latethis was after the expedited shipping and when everything showed up I didnt even have what I needed to utilize the product and service I paid for As a first time customer and brand new to the trade I wish I had spent 20000 in a better place Tough lesson to learn
I have ordered from AF five times The frames are terrific but the hardware they provide to hold the printbacking in place is terrible The spring clips are a joke and never deep enough I would expect more when paying 100 for a large hardwood frame
You only get one point for selling my 300 dollar ticket of which I only got 110 back
I hope now that Choice has highlighted these downright unscrupulous transactions scalpers and yourselves will no longer rip not only innocent ticket buyers  sellers but the promoters and musicians etc too
I will not be using Ticketmaster Resale again and I urge others to stop letting the greedy middleman profit
ACE car rentals in Auckland New Zealand which was booked through CAR TRAWLER
This is possibly the worst car rental company we have ever dealt with It took them 2 hrs to pick us up at the cruise terminal after 5 international calls to them and when we arrived at their offices they had already rented our vehicle to someone else despite the fact we had prepaid three months earlier They offered us the van that had picked us up in which they then had to take somewhere else to get insured for renting The vehicle smelled musty was in very poor condition and had extremely high mileage They offered us one free day on our 8 day rental for the inconvenience as they had no other car for us We refused to take it and asked for our rental to be cancelled The manager Vic Hodges cancelled the booking and said we would have to get our refund from CarTrawler as they had my payment not Ace There was no indication given that we would have any difficulty in being reimbursed our 91000 CDN We rented elsewhere and got a better condition vehicle at a lower price
Getting reimbursed for our original Ace rental has been a frustrating and unsatisfactory experience Car Trawler are very difficult to deal with as each time you contact them you are handled by a different person Eventually a Victoria took control and things looked more promising However the whole process took over 6 weeks and in the end was not resolved to our satisfaction in that we did not receive a full refund Car Trawler maintained that Ace had had the funds all the time not Car Trawler and that Ace refused a refund to Car Trawler because we had turned down a suitable vehicle for no good reason However as a gesture of goodwill Car Trawler were willing to provide a partial refund of
61000 CDN
Since this experience I have checked reviews of both Ace Rental Cars and Car Trawler Of course it would have been better to have done this before I rented but I made my original booking through Hotelscom and since I have used them for many years for booking hotel accommodation and ben very pleased with the results I saw no reason not to trust them when it came to vehicle rental Obviously I was mistaken
On the website will find most reviews give a 1 or 2 out of 10 and many have similar complaints as mine
And the Consumer Affairs website lists the top 287 complaints about Car Trawler
In short do not book with Car Trawler or Ace Car Rental in Auckland bpossibly the worst experience we have ever had with a car rental company anywhere in the world And Hotelscom should stop using Car Trawler as a car rental partner as well as stop recommending Ace Car Rentals in New Zealand
Facebook is manipulated and censored RUBBISH SITE
I received my first order with no issues My second order however was a completely different experience and will definitely be my last My Rep Amanda was at first nice in emails and on the phone with me However she was rude and lacked professional phone manners and was deceptive when she spoke with my Drs office so much so that the Office manager had to intervene Her attitude and language was totally unacceptable and I was personally embarrassed when notified by my Drs office From there I then received multiple emails from her each one showed aggressive punctuation and frustration The issue was finally resolved but I assure you I will not be dealing with this company again
I had an account that i was locked out of and they refused to help me
I had registered the account to a email but have been using facebook to login since i created it
They instructed me to create another one while keeping my info and pictures that i can no longer access
inexcusable I had to correspond with 5 different people some didnt even get back to me and if they did it would be several hours later
inexcusable
This is a horrible company DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM AT ALL COSTS After my inlaws missed their return flight from Delhi to Montreal we booked lastminute flights this morning through TravelGenio on Air India and Air Canada We received a confirmation email immediately but no followup email with the actual tickets It was only after calling Air India four hours later that we learned that the reservation had been cancelled because of payment issues We never received any cancellation notice from TravelGenio We then called TravelGenio and they told us that the seats on that flight were no longer available and there was nothing they could do except look for new flights for the next few days or reimburse us This company led us to believe that everything was fine when my inlaws in fact had no seats on the flight Looking at other comments this is not a unique instance If you want to have your tickets cancelled without your knowledge this is a great company for you Otherwise DO NOT use this awful company
According to my husband who was home at the time of delivery they were unwilling to take the door off to get the furniture in They didnt put anything together and the lamp shade is broken They left boxes everywhere
It is unacceptable the way things were left and their attitude was poor We need different people back out to assemble what they didnt do and a new lampshade

I have made a number of purchases on DH Gate with my Prepaid Master Card up to 0217
With my new card now activated until 0220 it has been refused with no explanation I email for help and the assistant took several transcribes to realize my card was Prepaid even after telling her 3 times previously that it was They told me that they would not accept Prepaid Cards Aliexpress has excepted and is still excepting my prepaid Master Card for over 3 years now and I have made purchases on DH Gate with it previously before it expired They then just ignored me and went off line leaving me hanging there not knowing that the transcribe had ended They also had sent me a link to a site that was all in Chinese with no translation click
I get an order number emailed to me to pay for a purchase before it expires without a link to find and go there to remind me of what the item was so as to be able to do so
I would use aliexpress exclusively but there are still some items that I need that are sold here but not available there
Lesson learned research products before purchasing
Tried to buy a laptop from this company only to find out they were manipulating the prices on more than on ad not happy at all I would advise stay clear of this company
I order 5 bunches of 60 roses to be delivered  the roses they show on the website were not available so i had to buy a more expensive bouquet They obviously didnt think that anyone would count how many were delivered  but as I was using them for a school charity event i counted  they had short changed me by 50 roses They would usually get away with this  how many of us know what flowers we should receive when they are delivered to us
I was then offered a nominal refund  25 pounds in all  which i refused I asked for the flowers to be returned as their website states that if you are not happy you can have a refund
They have now sent me a further 50 roses  which have arrived damaged several have the heads broken off and the rest are brown around the edges  certainly well past their sell by date
Both days i have been on hold to customer services for well over an hour
When i rang giving my order number  they even couldnt find the order
My husband and his friends booked a trip with Tripsta from Copenhagen to Mnchen for Oktoberfest 2017 The trip is with an SAS flight from CPH and a return flight with Transavia A couple of months ago Transavia oh do not even get me started on their non existing customer care contacted us explaining that they have changed the return flight for the day before If tis was not suitable for them Transavia would refund the tickets Great we asked for a refund because they wanted to stay that extra day
So now when we ask Transavia where the money is they tell us that they refunded the amount ca DKK 2500 to Tripsta weeks ago Of course we cannot get trough to Tripstas customer care because it does not exist so no money no tickets and a bitter taste that we should have been much better at checking the reviews here because then we NEVER would have chosen a booking agent with a reputation like this
Stealing is a crime last time I checked
I have found DPD to be consistently unreliable and find i have to go to a lot of effort in chasing to have my parcel delivered The status on mine said it was delivered yesterday but i received no message email or note and now have no idea where it isThis has happened before and I try to avoid retailers who use DPD due to the hassle I experience each time
This site lacks customer service
I placed an order days ago and seeing that it has not shipped I contacted customer service to check on the status and cancel if it hadnt shipped as I did not know it was in a different country but have yet to hear back from them
Looks like Ill have to dispute the charge with my credit card company
Envato uses a customer unfriendly payment system which is rigid and borderline unethical They require that your payment be processed with additional processing fees unless you buy credits which are only purchased in increments of 10 Furthermore all refunds are not refunded to your original payment but into credits that must be used at envato If you choose to buy another item with those refunded credits you must complete the purchase with credits and cannot use PayPal or a credit card to complete the difference This means in many cases you are forced to buy more credits in increments of 10 20 minimum This forces the customer to waste money amd I consider it a form of legalized theft
When I confro thier customer service about these issues which are only reached by email hour later they had little regard for my concern and offered no resolution
Overall I would not use envato as a seller nor buyer as this company should not be rewarded for its unethical and unfriendly business practices
The site declared free tax preparation but it cost 50 The site also informed me after I paid that me that the IRS would not accept efiles for late taxes but I spoke to an IRS agent that said that it could be efiled for 2015 and 2014 So I still have to mail in my forms Im not sure what this site did other than the simple math I thought it was going to be efiled Im not recommending this site and Im not sure that my taxes are even correct now Caution
I had ordered a set of cartridges for my Epson 600 specifying not once not twice but three times that I wanted the extra capacity black ink cartridges and was assured each time that Yes that is what you will receive Wrong A subsequent phone call promised me a return phone call from the ManagerOwner who never obliged and ignored my complaint That dereliction aside Im now hoping all works out as anticipated Perhaps once the ordertaking Representative  Dio  shunted my order to staff it was treated as routine and undeserving of any special treatment Dunno but I doubt this is the way the ManagerOwner would care to be treated
I ordered Halo Wars 2 the unlimited version which was supposed to come on the 17th of February On the 19th I contacted customer service and asked where it was They told me it hadnt been shipped yet and they would ship it out asap It eventually arrived on the 21st the same day as the regular version I was not very pleased as it was a gift
When looking at guest recensions it is only the positive you see and nothing about the negative recension so it is easy done booking a really bad hotel thinking it is pretty ok
so I paid nearly 300 for an Iphone 6plus 64gb next day delivery when the phone arrived I activated the phone then put my sim card in then decided to make a call I then realised I couldnt hear anything at all and the person on the other side couldnt hear me either Then I thought I would try another number and it happened again turns out the phone was faulty and I couldnt make calls at all What kind of company sells phones without doing the very simple thing of checking it actually calls out and works I then realised the phone dont vibrate either so this so called company asked me to send them the phone I am now nearly 300 down and without a phone and they tell me there is no compensation and i have to wait up to 10 working days for another phone or to fix the one i sent them its ridiculous i wish I used another company and never had dealt with them I have to wait 10 working days without a phone at all now I would give them absolutely ZERO stars if i could and I will be putting this review on every review company i come across and will not be recommending this company to anyone at all and advise everyone to stay well clear from them
The info you need is ridiculous Transferring the loan to the person who is going to use the loan is long winded and not necessary for it to be done that way
You dont honor your price match program Classic bait and switch
Ordered as a holiday gift and it was delivered late Mass email shared my address with hundreds of others and I received everyones replies all day Lack of professionalism Never received personal communication
Surely those reviews are fake  this site is crap had a room up and got messages 2 weeks after they were sent to me with a message saying delayed due to early bird status it just wants you to pay has a lot of fake listings  All these people in my area looking for places yet only people to apply are foreign and then they only apply dont enter into any further conversation  Yes there are some real people on here but it is hard to connect with them with this site pushing into u to pay Why the hell they try to charge people when they are possibly in need I will never know make your money by selling some advertisement space on the Site not charging desperate and young people for it  I have since listed room on Gumtree and had a ton of applications within a day of posting and all free and no scammers trying to get me to pay
Surprised with the service this year normally the staff member dealing with your query regarding renewals do their up most 2 keep you with this companyi didnt feel that this year
they send goods from the Israelis so theres punitive tariffs to Europe remember that if you live in eu

Very bad experience and probably I will never book the flight with this company

My brother spent 500 on 3 tickets for Wales  Ireland game today for a special birthday celebration Bought the tickets months ago They never arrived Said all this week e tickets would arrive They never did Family travelled to UK for nothing Absolutely appalling Shocking company So upsetting
I do not think that I ever received a confirmation email regarding my reservation I do not even know the name of the company with which I have my reservation I only know the number which is 524641017
Please send me the relevant information
My experience with Goldcar was terrible and from overhearing the conversations of the customers near me I must conclude that it was the same for them
I will keep this brief
 Goldcar charged my card three times so I had to call them after the rental and request for them to return the two additional charges They wouldnt do it themselves and without being called
 Goldcar gave me a completely different car from what I ordered
 There was a fee for refueling the car despite the fact that I returned it with a full tank There is no logical explanation why a customer has to pay for this and everyone at the cashier was having the same argument with their staff
It took 20 minutes to collect keys to the car as there was only one girl working at the counter One party in front of me when I arrived but three behind me when I left Car had over 50000 kms on the clock but OK I have been charged for 3 x tolls which should only be 2 x tolls I have communicated the over charging of tolls to Redspot but have had no response to date
My HP printer recognized the cartridges as NOT HP cartridges It let me install them but they didnt print very good After several print head cleanings and switching out the other black that came with it still no good The printer worked fine before these cartridges I have basically just shelved the printer and will use it only for a fax now I learned my lesson HP cartridges only
Very slow website search function is clumsy difficult to use and outdated hard to believe this website is still viable and in use
The pictures and prices on their website do match They show a larger size arrangement with a price for a smaller arrangement Then they add a Service Fee in addition Your final price ends up being significantly higher Next time I will call around for other florists in the area to compare prices
I chose to move to Energia as I had been years with my old provider and rates were high All the other companies had better rates but Energia had a promise of 150 refund so I registered with them
I noticed after a few weeks that I had heard nothing about the 150 refund so I contacted them
I was told that because I had used the Switcher website I would not receive the refund This was news to me as nowhere throughout the registration process had this been flagged
I feel cheated and will certainly switch to another provider when my 12 months contract is up
I had to email them countless times before I got a response back a few weeks later It was very frustrating
I ordered the value pack with the extra black for a special price

I bought an item in Tomtop I received a defective item and I tried to claim Tomtop via their official support Tomtop never answered me and they did not solve the problem
UNTRUSTED SELLER
I will NEVER buy them again
Ordered a 100 arrangement for next day delivery Never arrived They took FOUR days to get back to me even though I inquired several times the day of supposed delivery And their whole spiel is that the flowers were delivered Screw these shameless grifters Here are some other companies owned by the same holding that you should avoid

Town Fair Tire
Milford ct
March 15 2017
What started out as a good day at Town Fair Tire turned out to be one of major disappointment In short I arrived for a front end alignment and a slow leak repair Due to the sharp eye of my technician a hairline crack was found in my rim This was a good find Instead of repairing the crack I felt it best to replace all four rims The desk clerk then located four displays at a good price I purchased them and was informed by yet another clerk that they could be put on later that afternoon  despite the growing number of customers arriving I agreed and waited for his confirmation call It came and I returned to Town Fair
Upon my techs completion of attaching my new rims with my old tires I overheard him mention something to my desk clerk regarding a turning issue Unsure if this was related to my vehicle or not I waited for the desk clerk to make mention of it He did not Therefore I didnt think it was related to me He then slid a document in front of me and said after I checked out the rims hed like me to sign the document  a waiver The waiver stated that once I signed it the work done was mine and I could not do anything about it afterwards First Ive never been asked to sign a document at Town Fair Second based on the fact Ive never had an issue with Town Fair I signed the document upon visually inspecting my new rims Upon departure my tires rubbed up against my forward fender with a quarter turn of the wheel This was what the Tech had mentioned and this was not relayed to me This appeared to be an underhanded move I returned to the desk and the desk clerk suggested I drive the vehicle back to the maintenance bays in the back of the building
Upon my arrival my technician approached and considered the problem He then assessed the problem The manager then came out and suggested that I could file the fender well back or apply washers to the bolts pulling up on the loose fender He claimed that he had other customers waiting and that he could not do anything about it
During this time while he was on his back under my car I stood watch for on coming traffic in the lot and noticed another technician in a customers vehicle peeling out driving recklessly between the parking spaces in an angered rush to enter the bay Closing time was upon them
I ignored this technician and concluded my Put Off with the manager I was not happy with the transfer of the problem
As I pulled away the angry tech shouted at me  Figure it out fagat
I slammed on my brakes and shouted out  Are you talking to me He didnt answer  having been surprised I heard him I addressed him again  he still ignored me He appeared angered and was pushing things around for his next assignment From another bay another tech shouted out  Hes not talking to you
I looked around and found no one else in the parking lot near me or behind me and thought it best to leave
The angry tech is described as a white male slender dark hair age twenty something and worked close to the center bay
Ill not return to Town Fair They have soiled their reputation with me
Daniel Whitney Former customer
I received a message from GOLDCAR charging us 120 euros for a missing parcelback shelf GOLDCAR had an incomplete record of the sate of the car due to their informatic system and accused us of removingstealing the back shelf of the car They took the money from our account with no consent and never replied to any of our emails Customer service from the beginning was HORRIBLE The funny part We are not the first ones being charged for a parcel shelf missing
I received without a doubt knock off Prada sunglasses I should have known the price was too good to be true They did a good job of making them look authentic logo etching in lenses signature unique R yet I could tell by the weight of the frames and the case they came in they were fake Frames almost felt like plastic I had tried on the same pair a week before in a store and they were metal and much heavier They dont look bad though if youre fine with sacrificing authenticity to save a little  then this is the place to shop
Unhelpful customer service interviews you like an immigration officer with details no longer relevant to the car or insurance and then decides to cancel your insurance policy based on unverified presumptions stay away
Always use goldcar never had problem car always clean we trust the refund on fuel not used had to wait last time for the car but was very busy
14 days and no information as to where parcel is
Could have done better
More jerking around After almost of month of numerous email exchanges and videos and only after posting bad reviews now they email wanting to know how much return shipping will cost Not that they will pay for it not that they will refund or replace the product but how much is shipping So now I guess they expect me to find out cost of return shipping email them again and wait for them to make a decision if it is worth returning the product or if they will cover the cost of the return for a DOA product I am just so tired of being jerked around by terrible customer service Never again
I ordered 3 separate packages One was delivered on time the other not until a day later In the meantime I received an email that the package would be delayed Unfortunately this email was sent to numerous people and not blind copied Therefore every email recipients address was exposed This is unacceptable
The lava cakes were good but cupcakes not so great
I paid 25 last week for flowers to be sent to my girlfriend for her birthday I made the purchase 48 hours beforehand to allow plenty of time The company guarantees a oneday delivery which can on occasion take 2  no problem The flowers all 5 of them arrived 4 days late total of 6 days and were in terrible condition stuffed into a small box
I rang the company on several occasions each time I was promised that the flowers would be arriving that day  which never happened
The final day I rang the company again as I had received an email confirming the flowers arrival was not the case When I told the woman on the phone I wanted to speak to a manager she told me there were none in on that day Then when I threatened to take legal action she told me her manager was in a meeting and would be available in a few minutes For the entirety of the 3 occasions I rang the business I was told every time that I would and could not be refunded I was even given the email for the owner of the company who to this day has not replied to me
This is the worst company I have EVER had to deal with it An absolute disgrace Moneyrobbingbtards
On top of all that I just found out yesterday my phone company was charging me 12 for the call DO NOT make the same mistake I made
A purchase I made was never made right nor did customer service exactly make anything close to right
The company that was selling the products seemed to be a bogus numberNo one answered and when it finally came through I was hung up on on three different occasions
Now its been over a month and Groupon hasnt made anything right And Im left having to swallow a scandalous loss of my own money for items that were likely never even sent to me
Customer service is a shame  Its either a computer system set up to answer any key words that you type Or its another clever way to hide the reason of having to hire people from a foreign country to communicate with American customer issues
I dont know but what I do know is that Im left feeling so frustrated and unsatisfied with the services That purchasing anytime in future doesnt look likely Having to pay an extra 500 doesnt seem so bad if the services hold true to their word
Need better rate 4 costomers and need to inprove your web site
The host was very keen to give his best Unfortunately this was not enough Unfortunately he did not stick to collusion
 He had attended several guests at the same time I have paid for myself as a solo traveler but I had to share the bathroom and in the end I had no room at all and had to sleep in the living room
 He always called me wrong opening times and ways I spend two weeks at Teheran but could not visiting every place because of wrong open times he told me and other traveler he hosts at the same time
 I needed to change the apartment during the trip because of construction work and other guests
 The appartment was very dirty
 He reacted to criticism not always friendly
Of course there were also good sides
 The apartments are very centrally located in Tehran The metro and buses are easily accessible There are also many cafs and restaurants in the area Sights are easily accessible
 A real delicious breakfast and its very nice attentive and good cooking woman
But all in all I can not recommend this property What I had agreed with him six months in advance was obsolete on the spot
I have used pickupflowerscom before and had a decent experience But this time it was a horrible experience I was online and on the phone with them this morning and after many minutes thought everything had gotten squared away Then this morning at 1102 I received an email from them stating that my package was successfully delivered but where it was going it would have been 1202 in the night I dont think any company delivers that late I have tried to contact them again live chat and on the phone and live chat i didnt get a response and no one answered the phone So I am out of nearly 100 I will not use pickupflowerscom ever again
I tried to make a purchase today for the 5 for 10 Starbucks gift card except it wouldnt let me I chatted in and spoke with Keerthiga C who told me I already purchased it which was incorrect I hadnt He or she stated it was pending with PayPal I showed them a screenshot where it wasnt Keerthiga C stated there was nothing they could do till it failed and they then could cancel it Again there was nothing pending Keerthiga C then tried to pass it off as technical glitch
I was never logged into PayPal or hit submit on a purchase so Groupon has now essentially submitted a transaction without me fully authorizing it I will no longer trust Groupon and am filing complaints with BBB and IC3
They take your money and then want more for add ons If you want a refund they tell you to cancel your control Paypal Dispute and let them control if you get your money back Dont cancel Paypal keep your control Nor would i recommend this service I am stressed out now because they are giving me problem to give me back my money for a service I DID NOT USE FOR ONE MINUTE
I have orderd two septums in different orders One I have only wore for 1 weekend and the second one I have worn more While wearing it the jewels fell off making it look ugly When I wanted to put on the other one I also noticed that the jewels have fallen off I find it sad to see my beautifull septums die after only a month or so I expected a better quality item
Wat is the use of giving free time period of one week I dnt want to give my card details till the time I get statisfied with ur services This seems to b sum kind of trick
most books were not sellable when we did sell the check was not readable by the bank and had to be replaced a lot to go through for 2500 not sure if ill use this service again
No options to talk to anyone rather than the chat The online options do NOT cover everything you may need and there are way too many charges for changes online It should be all free company doesnt care about customers and will do everything not to talk to you pushing for online charged services Not possible to reach out to anyone via phone very disappointing
The only thing good so far about your lowend facility in Bryan TX on Baker Street is the manager Victoria The info I go online was virtually all wrong except for the price The lanesaisles in the Baker Street facility are very narrow and can accommodate only the smallest trailers If it were not for Victorias pleasant way I would be in another facility
This company has great cakes BUT they breached my confidential information on Valentines Day when they missed all their orders for that day and sent out a mass public email with 100s of customers emails
So my email was exposed to 100s of strangers who began to hit reply all and complain for hours Then they send out an apology with a ridiculous offer of 20 off my next purchase Why would I ever purchase again from them
I placed 3 orders for clothes it took over 4 weeks to get them all outfits where to small to wear Will not order again

Unlike Autoreisen in Lanzarote Goldcar in Tenerife are inefficient so despite a relatively short queue it was about an hour before I was allocated a vehicle You expect a hard sell for additional insurance but even after stating that I already had cover the aggression continued Id booked a VW Polo or similar but was fobbed off with a Dacia Sandero an unwieldy unsophisticated vehicle OK on the motorway but not great for parking on an island where parking is often oversubscribed I noted numerous deep and rusting scratches on the bonnet and roof and got this signed off When returning the vehicle the woman checking me in wasnt interested in signing the sheet and as soon as shed registered the mileage ran off with the keys and disappeared from view A few days later they deducted 250 euros from my credit card and sent me an email saying thank you for trusting Goldcar the attachment may be of interest to you This stated  checkin bonnet  250 euros They used a noreply email address for this communication I raised an issue using the online form and 2 weeks later received an acknowledgement the damage hadnt occurred during my rental period However they refused to reimburse my credit card and I had to send my bank account details to obtain the refund I have still ended up out of pocket due to exchange ratescommission I will avoid them in future
We have booked a villa with pool in Florida a month ago with Flexible Pay Vacations though Bookingcom We leave in 4 days and have not been supplied a single detail of where we are staying or any of the facilities in the property or nearby I spent hours looking through their properties only to be told after booking it may not be the property we choseSo why give us all the choice I spent hours choosing I have been requesting the details of the property we are getting on a regular basis from at Sue of Flexible Pay Vacations who could not have been more unhelpful It is like she is withholding the information on purpose to make us more anxiousShe replies to my emails with 1 word or 1 sentence answers with no information whatsoever I approached Bookingcom two days ago to help get some information and they have not come back to me either What am I supposed to do if I miss any excursions because they have been booked by the time I get there I cannot get any replies from either of the booking companies I am so stressed and frustrated I cannot even begin to explain
My father placed an order for a stair lift and paid a 2000 cash deposit The next morning he cancelled the order as he was given much cheaper Quote s from several other companies
20 days from cancellation date and he has still not received his deposit back I have contacted them several times to be told the cheque is in the post Totally unacceptable
The yelp reviews of the dealerships Truecar chose for me were in my opinion terrible I live in the bay area and there are many Toyota dealerships who work with Truecar here  why Truecar didnt give me more or better options is beyond me The site should ask you how far you are willing to travel and provide all Truecar options in that range
I accidentally gave this company the wrong email address and wrong shipping address do to a visual impairment I am trying to correct the problem I have sent them 3 emails with no response I cannot contact them through their website without the incorrect email address that I gave them Which I do not have If your company reads this please email me A French
im still waiting on a policy i renewed in jan to be uploaded
I gave them 2 books they emailed me saying they couldnt take one of them but they still kept the one they said they couldnt accept and I never got a check from them
cusromer service Never again
Product did not fit as customer service described I tried to double check with them but did not receive a response to several further emails I figured Id take a gamble and turns out it was a bad bet The shipping for returns was not worth my money so I ate the cost and just kept the product
Im new to PayPal I received a personal payment into my bank account in CAN from my sister in the US through PayPal about a month ago I tried repaying her from my bank account to her email address through PayPal the same accounts we used a month ago and it didnt process I called to ask what I was doing wrong and how to fix it and was met with a very abrupt security blocked it and you have to find another way to send the money So I asked to speak to her supervisor assuming hed be helpful and he was worse He spoke to me like I was doing something illegal and told me to find another company Im so confused as to why there would be a security concern as I was trying to send money from a big bank  TD from a chequing account that has money in it to my sister Isnt that a service they provide When I told him that his customer service was like me walking into a store and wanting to make s purchase and the clerk telling me to go to another store he said you just said you werent buying anything He didnt even understand the analogy Honestly  that customer service experience was like a twilight zone experience and it would be funny because so its so crazy if it didnt now inconvenience me on figuring out an efficient way to send money back to my sister
My advice Dont use PayPal if you dont have to Not only are they incredibly rude and not helpful it makes no sense that it states on the website that personal transactions are free yet when it converted my CAD amount into US when I tried to process the transaction it was an extra 35 when compared to current bank of Canada rates Sonething is extremely fishy with PayPal User beware
Dont feel robbed like I did I lived outside of Mexico and I bought two tickets for Pachuca VS Tigres in Pachuca Mexico They showed tickets for the area I wanted at 2800 Pesos so I paid around 142 dollars per ticket
Once in Pachuca I realized they paid 100 pesos per ticket So they charged me 27 times more than original price I understand they have to include overhead and profit on their prices but 27 times more than original price its just absurd
You are better off showing of earlier at the event and buy tickets there
When I was given a Quote d price it was all in HKD Hong Kong Dollars but when I paid for the balance you had charged me EUR instead for the deposit and the remaining balance I will have to pay in GBP at the time when I collect the car which this will definitely cost me more and not the Quote d amount given by you at first I am not satisfied at all
I tried to redeem my 300 reward points to get an item and OH BOY was this a challenge After clicking on the item i wanted it would say it was out of stock when I KNOW it is not I had to click on a different size then click BACK to my size to be able to add it to the cart it said it was successfully added to the cart so i hit cont shopping to my horror my cart was empty i repeated this process countless times until finally i discovered the loophole you have to click on your remaining points THEN click on the cart This is a very frustrating experience and something i do not want to have to partake in every time i make a rewards purchase I finally got it so dont worry just something to look out for
I sent in perfectly good books and they did not accept them however they wouldnt send them back without charging mefor my books This was stated no where before I sent them and only became news after they had my books Not only did I try to email them I tried calling them multiple times and got no response from anyone Worst customer service everSo now they just have my very expensive and very good quality books DO NOT SEND YOUR BOOKS HERE THEY WILL STEAL THEM
Always great prices and quick and reliable service too
The part in the picture is the correct part the part they sent is a Dorman4 Seasons type replacement The 4 seasons is smooth with no lip or indentation for a hose clamp to secure against like the picture shows and the part looks nothing like the advertised part picture at all On classic cars we need originality for judging And this part is cheaper at your local auto stores I ordered and was willing to pay more for original Very misleading ad for this part
I had to do 2 separate orders figuring out when to use credit and when to use the special pricing Its computer software  it should figure out for me I also tried several times to add the Jessi tank S to my bag It didnt say out of stock but wouldnt add Very frustrating
Also  why cant I look at all 78 capris with a searchrather than having to get all capris and pick through
Im 3 years and this is my last year with 25plus I have 23 years experience 13 years on Irish roads  without claim and they lifted 30 up my insurance policy
I ordered a top and 3 wall art sticker sets These were for gifts a couple weeks ago I have sent emails and my tracking shows that my packages arrived in the US on Jan 18 and Jan 21I wont order again but I do want the merchandise I have paid for 6 weeks ago
Susan
uninformative didnt explain what exactly he was gonna get me back in tax return Seem nervous and too worried about getting audited need more or better preparers
I used to love it Not anymore It has taken 2 months and 2 returns for them to deliver a freaking pare of lenses without lens defects The worse part is that they seam to consider this normal Dont expect other thing than a careless sorry Considering eyeglasses are built out of 3 parts Frame and 2 lenses it is incredible they havent been able to produce a quality product after sending my lenses back twice
Did not receive what I ordered Now I have to return a CD I did not order Inconvenienced to pay postage to return this CD I dont want Customer service was not apologetic just said send it back
I am so upset today with this company I know that the airlines cancels the flights but I also know that it is not the customers fault when this happens I booked my flight from RDU to DKR for April 7 I booked it in January early in order not to worry about it anymore For the past 2 months I have been getting emails of changes to my flights and cancellations nonstop Today I got another email with cancellations of 2 flights but the alternatives dont even work together because ill miss some of the flights if I accept the alternatives I have requested a refund and was told that I wont get a reply from them in 12 weeks A ticket to Africa is very expensive the more I wait to buy I will pay more if I dont get this money refunded in time to buy a new ticket I am so upset I cried knowing how much this ruins my plans This is the first time I booked with a company that has given me so much trouble I am hoping for a quick resolve of this problem
Reviewing for the second time Update my booking has been cancelled in order to submit a request for a refund but I have not received an email stating as such I should have received an email stating that my booking has been cancelled and that a request for a refund has been submitted This is very upsetting and I regret making a booking with travelgenio I have never had a problem with other sites
Good car its very easy to use and wonderful car
A few times I sent you emails about GIFT CARD ZEN  received a standard response I also sent emails to GCZ about gift cards for PANERA  I was told not to order that card So I ordered another card  got that I am sorry that you had this experience  The problem was either a ZERO BALANCE or a partial as the card was already used  I did get credit So I sent them an email stating that I was going to order 10 cards  I knew there would be problems Before I had a chance to order them  there were quite a few700 0r more they were taken off the list  were not put back Why were they listed to begin with They did not monitor them even after my bringing this to their attention And YOU never responded to my email So your partners need to do a better job  RAISE recently gave a guarantee for ONE FULL YEAR That is who I will using 
The picture looked lovely  the garment a poor shadow of the picture the fit not great even though we measured and used the size guide No extra in the seams for us to adjust sizeThe return policy for international purchases inadequate you need to obtain a return number with in 7 days of delivery date day three and still no reply from email or a return number An expensive mistake  an American site with American price paid in American dollars  for a cheap outfit made in China 
After placing an order with Willis they showed ads to me that said Complete your order in the add for nearly the same item I purchased initially The ad suggested to me that I had not completely checked out of their online order process Maybe I had not completed online order
So I ended up ordering twice Got plants that were below my expectations The online documentation describing my ship date was confusing too The ship date was listed as 20142019 
Customer service by phone was good
The only take your money If you dont receive the things you bought they dont care disputes and claims are just left open you only get automated useless replies to your messages and questions instructions on how to send them a formal complaint are useless and you just end up going in circles on their website Only good for sending money to a known and reliable person dont ever expect Paypal to protect your purchase in any way
The flowers came a day after my mums birthday they looked nothing like the picture advertised there were only four flowers in the bouquet
Despite this and I sent them a photo to prove the flowers were awful they refused to refund my money
I have reported them to Trading Standards  I will never use this company again
I visited there for some quick fast food late summer 2016 I had to walk out in disgust as there were flies all over the kitchen area lots of them not just one or two No staff seemed to bat an eyelid at them as they proceeded to land randomly on the walls ceiling and the customer service counter I walked out and purchased something from elsewhere Disgusting
As a foreigner living in Germany I travelled and of course I lived in my own country before I have never experienced any banks can lie and can be rude like Noris bank
Their advertisement tells people how we can get a bank card to withdraw our money outside of Germany without fee I checked their offer and details first and I saw that they stated they used Mastercard currency exchange rate to guaruntee the rate
I applied When I withdrew outside of Germany the rate was horrible and took advantage of me a lot I checked and compared its rate with Mastercard exchange rate It was not even close When I called to ask them they said its their bank and their policy they can Quote how much rate they want Seriously This is considered stealing  The guy on the phone was not even polite
They also took advantage of me with using their credit card on website I bought stuff from the store that located in Germany Noris charged me additionally for international fee When I contacted them quickly and provided related prove via email They gave me very hard time by telling me that they accepted only mail paper mail letter and everything from 1970
Gathering info for the police now
I ordered a blue pair of gloves but was sent grey I called customer service but no one answered so I left a message Its been over a week and no one has called me back B 
Patch received had a stain
Product received was wrong material wrong color and had a stain Talked me into a store credit instead of a refund and then quadrupled the price much cheaper locally Stated that since I agreed to a store credit a refund was no longer an option
Terrible service
They advertise the transfer will only take 1 day or 2 to reach the other party instead it will take 5 to 6 day as any other company Moreover the other party will not received the amount expected and when I called the customer service I was told the other bank may have charged a fee This is not true at all I have used transfer wise many times to transfer money to the same person and the bank has never charged anything First and last transfer I have already closed my account
I dont like the inconvenience of having to phone in to cancel months to avoid the 4995 monthly charge This is so discouraging and my husband doesnt like it
With a current rating of 78 out of 10 or 39 out of 5 on this site  Lyft would be deactivated from its own platform if it was a driver here

As it stands currently the cheaptaxi game is unethical no matter who you choose Although better than Uber in some respects Lyft is STILL a cynical and mostly terrible company for drivers For example the tipping policy hype conveniently leaves out that
 only 60 of the riders tip ridesharing is seen as a NONpremium service making it more expensive by adding a tip is counterintuitive
 the average tip amount isnt even 10 most waiters get 15 and they dont burn their own resources risk traffic or have to sustain conversation to POTENTIALLY get it
 and WORST of all Lyft likely only offers tipping as an incentive because they KNOW they cant compete with Ubers volume and at the same time shifts that part of the compensation to the driver try to get a tip when there are no rides
There are MANY other examples of awfulness by both companies some of which have been highlighted in the reviews on this site and others
Okay you say youre a passenger and couldnt care less about the driver Fair enough but consider that MANY Id believe MOST of the drivers are SEVERELY UNDERINSURED This makes the ride MUCH more dangerous for everyone there are REASONS why a cab ride is more expensive  insurance by cab companies is one of those reasons Wellnot actually everyone because ALL rideshare companies push AT LEAST some liability for an accident off to the independent contractor and DO NOT REGULARLY CHECK because there is NO VALUE to THEM to do so what sense does it make to take its labor force off the road
As a passenger why should you care  if youre injured in an accident likelier than a cab ride because the cabbies arent likely to be professionals as well as being distracted by the oftenawful app youre going to have a hard time collecting damages because
 MOST drivers arent wealthy and again arent wellpaid the claim of Up to 35hour plus tips by Lyft is cynical as it is rarely achievable and notatall sustainablebut I digress
 MOST insurance companies arent going to pay out on personal policies when the insured driver is working at the time of the accident
 Lyft specifically limits its exposure despite the FACT that it would be directly benefitting from the workproduct of the driver at the time of the accident the reason why Lyft prefers independent contractors I did mention cynicism right
Okay you say you dont use rideshare service anyway so youre immune Try again rideshare companies are effectively INCENTIVIZING people to become distracted UNINSURED MOTORISTSso if YOU drive youd be unwise not to include uninsured motorist insurance coverage on your vehicle And be prepared to pay an increasingly artificially high price for it thanks in part to these companies
These problems are only the tip of the iceberg
Although I never drove for Juno and wouldnt drive or use a rideshare service ever again knowing what I know now it seems to have the potential to inject some MUCH NEEDED ethics into this scumbag business Shame on BOTH Lyft AND Uber
Oh and I was a 494rated driver and accidentfree with over 1200 rides when I stopped driving for Lyft in November 2016
Cant go wrong with free shipping however they are very stingy with coupons and doing a price adjustment with another site has unnecessary steps because they make it so difficult for no reason There are there better stores out there
I wasnt approved for loan
I think they are selling junk stuff then will claim ignorance I got a smartphone that had screen defects and will not charge on arrival They try to get you to accept a part refund or spend tons of money returning their stuff when they should not have even bothered to send because it was not working I DO NOT TRUST THEM OR BELIEVE THEIR REPLIES
They were supposed to deliver my package but I was notified that my address could not be found I spoke to the customer service agent who was very pleasant and verified my address was correct she is the only reason I gave 2 stars She was also confused as to why they could not find my address I have had deliveries from purolator multiple times before She scheduled the delivery for the next day but again it did not get delivered because of some ridiculous reason that they missed this delivery even though it had been out for delivery since 7am in the morning Such a terrible delivery service
My order was cancelled without contact I than reordered the item and it was late for Christmas Pretty terrible service if you ask me
Took out a policy with multitrip easy as others have said unfortunately I needed emergency medical assistance for my son which to be fair multitrip handled well the probelms started with the money side of things Multitrip wouldnt approve the costs with the hospital while we were there they wanted to check prices before approving so to be able to leave the hospital I had to pay by credit card once he had the required treatment not great but I can deal with that The problem arrises when you try and claim the costs back multitrip use travel claims services ltd to process their claims they appear to be a loss adjuster I completed all the paperwork meticulously and sent it in Three weeks later and no reply I chased them up when they finallly do answer the phone they seem pretty disinterested and say they are waiting for a hospital report I point out this is a lie as I have sent them the medical report and invoice from the hospital along with my credit card bill reply is erm ok sir sorry about that we must be waiting for something else I said I was going to post a review if they couldnt come back to me with anything today they didnt seem to care didnt come back with anything so here it is They cannot give a date when the claim will be processed or when we will be paid all the claim is legitimate I feel very let down and disappointed I thought I had decent cover but it appears I dont I need to pay the pretty large credit card bill for the treatment and Im not sure when or if Im going to get reimbursed They may be competitive and easy to get cover but watch out if you need to claim they are proving to be a nightmare for me I rely on trustpilot reviews a lot so hopefully this review will help others if you do take out a policy make sure they pay the hospital direct however long this takes dont pay out and hope to claim it back because it is not straightforward
Just had this rabble try and defraud me Luckily bank caught it and blocked the transactions Must have retained my details from hiring a car 6 months ago Avoid
Long story short I ordered wheels over the phone to make sure I wouldnt have any problems Told them year make and model Receive them by UPS go have them installed and they dont fit my vehicle I tried send them back arguing with them they told me they fit my vehicle and wont pay for shipping to return them
Do not rent a car in this company I never felt so robbed in my life Really disappointed
Order took 17 days to arrive No backorder notice or delay notice just in processing Credit card billed twice for same order Product was good and exactly what I needed but service was very poor
I ordered a funeral spray for my aunt in Childress Texas After assuring me several times they serviced Childress I placed my order The next day at the funeral  no flowers I had received a phone call at my home that they had no designers able to do the job More phone calls and problem getting credit Terrible company
I never got any emails calls and no Quote s Waste of time
Having tried to make a booking on their site and after repeatedly getting web errors I finally made the booking to find the dates had reset when I refreshed the page I have continually contacted them and they ahve stalled and tried to blame everyone else for the payment being none recoverable  DO NOT USE
Although their website is professional and they sometimes reply back to email I still find their service unacceptable I paid 89 to unlock my iPhone 6 Plus they sent me an email that the job is completed This is not the case my phone is still locked with Softbank I had to contact them reconfirmed my IMEI number The Customer Service got back to me saying they were passing it to their Support team as they can see it is still locked with a specific carrier 6 weeks later nothing happened Ive been trying to get in touch but no luck If this is the standard service this company provides I would like to advise others to look elsewhere

Dear Trustpilot I joined Fabkids because my coworker joined JustFab Neither we know once we bought one item they already enrolled us with the 29993999 monthly membership We called to cancel immediately but we are still worried will they charge us the membership fee as we may not aware of it and many reviews stated that they will continue charging you membership fee even though you called to cancel My coworker even went to change her bank account because of that This is the worst experience ever We would not even go to their websites because they gave us such a scam feeling We will definitely not recommend Fabkids to anyone even so I will tell more parents to be aware of that
Paid for next day delivery but got one game five days late and another game three days dont bother with next day delivery because youll be waiting either way
I ordered and paid for a smartphone on January 1 2017
Someone at TinyDeal without my permission changed my address and sent the order to an address that was not correct The order to deliver in Portugal did not leave Germany According to DHL On the basis of your consignment number we were able to conclude that the consignment was returned to the Amazon Logistics Center Pforzheim Germany on January 9 To this day I did not receive the order and TinyDeal did not return the money They also did not contact DHL to find out where the order is and yet to make matters worse they did not responded to my last two messages
Even worse they claim that As we informed you that we were informed that the order was delivered successfully
I have already asked them to show me proof of that but they have not responded so far
I have several messages from DHL saying that the order was returned to the sender
The first three purchases I made at TD went well
The fourth purchase I did not receive the order after two months they received it back and only returned me 95 of what I paid
Unfortunately I decided to make a new purchase and this is my greatest nightmare
The postsales service seems to only read part of the messages and most of the time it just answers  Hope you could kindly wait a bit longer 
I paid with paypal for the first time few weeks ago I paid with Euro card for price in Euro as well When I saw my banking statement well I was robbed by 57 Euro just from currency rate exchange I live in non EU zone The rate was unimaginable bad existent only on paypal
That was about 5 of the total transaction price shameless scammers will never use it again nor ever recommend
Terrific service could not be any better thank you
They charge my preregistered card a few days in advance of my arrival date but they charge it in British  because it is from a British bank but the card is in Australian  and I have to pay a conversion fee They say they cannot change this They did not make it clear in what currency I would be charged when I made the bookings I will never use Agoda again
The turnaround time was great I received the part but it leaks
First I would like to say Giant Vintage does have great sunglasses really But my problem was I got sent the wrong pair of sunglasses emailed them about the whole situation and was assured my original pair would be sent Never was  And stopped answering me 
Ordered an Under Armour hoodie online which showed stock of 10 But got a call the following day to say the item was not available when they went to pick it for dispatch and they would refund my money if I didnt want any other item instead Strange thing is I was watching the item for a few days before I ordered it and stock went from 16 to 10 over a week so someone was buying it Not acceptable that a company of this size cannot supply an item if stock shows 10 I can understand if it was showing 1 as it could be lost or soiled but 10 Needless to say I wont bother using this company again There are many other places to but these items
called for times with problems and no call back BAD service
I have received locks without keys
Very disappointed with the last minute date change delivery timely matter

I just had another episode with the stupidity that is Purolator They didnt deliver my package they never came to my door I get a phone call from one of their drop off locations saying they have my parcel The parcel is in the next town 30 km away Really that cant be the closest drop point But this was an improvement on the last time when they were supposed to deliver a 2 carton delivery from the USA They sent back box 1 of 2 saying my address didnt exist and called me to pick up box 2 of 2 If they are owned by Canada Post why cant they figure out addresses There is someone at my house 247 we have home business and a driveway alarm that goes off if anyone drives in Why have I never had a parcel delivered to my house even though the drivers all say they came to the door and nobody was home Why do FedEx and DHL have no problems delivering to us
Been using YouTube for years loved it once but harsh censorship and false view counts has destroyed this site It should be called CorporateTube
I made a simple human error while purchasing an online topup as I punched in a wrong number by mistake
Despite my sincere request the company flatly refused to either refund the amount nor were they willing to credit the amountto the rightful customer
Shame on Ding for their approach

Hi
We would like to subscribe an annual plan with rental cover with 6800 covered in case of an accident written on the quotation but in the policy they written 1900 in case of an accident so we reported them this mistake online they said that they will fix it and go back to us to let us know in order that we could suscribe They also talked about end of annual plan yesterday night so we asked to be more specific why a end They said that every night all annual plan not subscribe are canceled and begin the next day with another quotation asked and today we tried to contact them they replied that the annual plan doesnt exist anymore We asked them help to fix this problem because it wasnt explain like this they dont reply anymore and they evicted me of the chat we let some messages on their website but no call back and its impossible to have another quotation online for an annual plan today neither for a simple cover for one rent with a campervan and 4x4 we felt abandon unless we just want to subscribe an insurance because the pick up of the campervan was yesterday so disappointed
I received my order  minus the Back to the Future BluRay and Donnie Brasco BluRay I had no knowledge that I wouldnt be getting them I had to call about the missing items and was told if they come back in stock in the next ten days they would be sent If not I would have to keep checking to see if they came in Not cool The only reason I placed the order in the first place was because of the Back to the Future set Im gonna have to think long and hard about ordering from you again
Lack customer services The car given was very dirty both inside and out
I purchased 2 stunning watch on Jomashop At first I was also very concerned about the problem receiving the goods more slowly than expected as when buying online the other but its surprising when that did not happen at Jomashop Service track order is very
great it makes me feel very assured and proactive with orders I have placed Quality of product is very good and Im very satisfied and will definitely buy more products from Jomashop Thanks Jomashop very much
The products are probably some of the best and most trusted on the market but I have found them unreliable in maintaining stock levels over recent months due to not obtaining correct shipping documents to have their stock sent from the USA I have been trying to get hold of Nutri Adrenal Concentrate and Nutri Thyroid Gland Concentrate since November 2016 and was advised it would be in stock towards end February though it is still not available I called in November and spoke to a representative who was shockingly rude and abrupt with me when asked why they were out of stock and when to expect to be able to place an order If they are not in stock by end February I will have to try another trusted brand where hopefully their staff are not quite so rude and unhelpful At present I would not recommend buying from them due to the unreliability and rudeness to theither customers
doesnt care about the client  I bought a glasses and didnt fit so I contacted with customer service to exchanged with other one  the agent told me you pay for return label  hassle free is Fake  I paid 42 for return and I cancelled the exchange and asked for my refund  and no one told me even WHY
We applied with this company for a small loan to assist in our expansion They had us jumping though hoops to get qualified We had plenty of funds in the account to prove we received funding regularly provided copies of checks bank verification letter We also provided a tax return showing adequate funding The business owner is very conscience of who she provides her financial information to due to severe fraud in the past she takes serious precautions when it comes to her business Firsr Ondeck tried to say the business should have their own tax return We explained that since the owner is a sole proprietor and the business was an LLC she filed a schedule C The underwriter didnt know that We provided a preview only voided check that we provide anyone who needs a voided check  no issues ever before they wanted verification from the bank They wanted the articles of incorporation we provided thatThey did notice that the social on one of the tax returns was off a digit The IRS didnt even notice that So as a result they didnt feel comfortable giving the loan What a waste of time and effort Wished they would have just said no in the first place
Extremely dissatisfied with this company They did not disclose their policies regarding returnexchanges when cold selling their products via telephone Was also promised something upon purchase did not receive what was promised When I telephoned to explain about our machine was spoken to extremely curtly Will definitely not be purchasing from this company again and would certainly NOT recommend them to anybody
i order two parts but only get one part delivered to my home
I sent four books and only payment for one book The other book sent back and I never received pyment for the last 2 books they still have
I purchased 6 tickets for a family vacation 5 days before departure we checked our reservation to confirm seats only to find our entire trip had been cancelled Called FlightHub and they said it was due to their airline being unable to provide a flight segment and that their system had sent me an automated email at 1144 pm 48 hours after I had booked my trip Essentially even if you are spending 4000 it doesnt matter enough for them to call you to tell you they have cancelled your entire purchase  their effort only goes as far as automated middleofthenight emails that end up in your spam box We had to rebook new flights at double the price directly with an airline this time because after 3 hours on the phone with FlightHub they refused to take any responsibility
Had booked a flight GvA to YUL Flight got cancelled For more than 5 days I try to find a solution with lots of options available Customer service replies but nothing happens The day of the flight approches still no reaction Customer service is horrible Avoid this company As long everything stays as booked its ok but if irregularities happen you are lost with them This I had to learn
Over 4 weeks to recieve the CDS
I ordered 2 pairs and it was the biggest waste of money So disappointing they are unwearable they hurt my head and are the worst quality Ive ever seen
In December when I ordered from Groupon I never received my package It said delivered but it wasnt and I sent an email about it but never heard back Because I have received items in the past and the price is good I ordered again I ordered a three pair earring set but only got two pair I dont know what happened to the third pair The package was sealed when I received it so
Ive been a long time ProBikeKit customer usually I got my order shipped to Australia from the UK within 58 days
Its now been 3 weeks and Im still waiting
I wrote to customer service asking about this only to be told it can take up to 30 days to come
Well if that is the new norm I will not be dealing with them again
Ive bought stuff from wiggle and ribble and it always arives within 7 to 9 days
Not a happy customer
I ordered a prom dress in the size they had available was charged the amount of the dress and then started receiving emails stating that they could not get the dress to me in time of our event then eventually that they did not have the dress at all A very disturbing service And Im still waiting to get my  back which of course takes a long time Not at all happy about this
I was disappointed with my experience with boxyMo for a few reasons When I first bought the policy I didnt realise I had only bought 8000km so when I contacted boxymo about 3 weeks into my policy to change my mileage plan I was told it was too late so I ended up spending twice the original amount as I had to keep topping up on mileage all yearEven though it was my own fault for not reading the info on the website correctly I still thought it was bad form to not allow me to change the milleage plan at an early stage so I could have saved money I really felt I got ripped off big time
Another reason I was really disappointed with boxyMo was the lack of communicationit was so frustrating when I had a problem and I couldnt pick up the phone and speak to someone I had to send a message online and sometimes wait up to 3 days before someone called me back and the fact that boxyMo would only make one attempt to call back was really frustrating if I missed the call I had to send another message online and wait again for the call This was a really frustrating and bad service
Finally another big issue was this I wanted to buy a new car and swap over my box and I was told I would have to pay for this service so again boxyMo just wanted to take more money of me Overall I just felt BoxyMo were out to get as much money as possible of me and in return offered me a very poor customer service experience I was relieved at the end of my policy so I could move onto a better insurance company with an excellent breakdown service
I spoke with a very nice man who tried to be very helpful However I still dont have my tickets or a Boarding pass
I ordered prescription lenses online last week Sunday and was sent an email notification that I would receive my order within 35 working days Today is day 5 and I have not yet received my order I specifically needed my order for this weekend The 0800 number in Wellington is non existent and the company uses an automated email response Could a consultant from SmartBuyGlasses please contact me still in today to advise the progress of my order or any delays
Still waiting for my phone Ordered since february 16th 2017 Today is 28th of march 2017 Too long
I purchased a remote controlled plane from TomTop via PayPal The order was cancelled as per your request though I never requested a cancellation and the item was charged and not refunded Please do yourself a favor and do not buy from this fraudulent company I now have to file a claim with PayPal what a hassle Never again Be warned
Whom ever your web designers are should be fired I cant find out anything about my test resaults every link I click takes to me a buy a month membership or a year Im beginning to think this is a big scam I understand the demand is high But some kind of status bar would be nice Or maybe the Ancestry sight isnt mobile friendly
I booked a flight from Calgary to Grand Cayman at the end of January I received a call Feb 12 saying the airline cancelled the last leg of the journey Talked to Flight Hub and they said they would rebook that leg but it would take 10days to do this with their flight partners I said that was not acceptable as I had to know I had a flight booked After 40 minutes on the phone they came back and said they were able to do this They sent me the revised ticket Today 3 weeks later they call me and say it is an issue and not booked What They basically said either we change our dates or they will refund in 8 weeks I called the Airline directly and had it straight in 20 minutes The customer service is horrible The person that left a message last night was barely understandable and did not leave a number Never ever again
I have used Newsdemon on and off for some years now and the service has always been excellent The only problem I had was when I tried to cancel the VPN the software would not allow it I emailed customer svcs and they demanded an explanation for my decision to cancel It took 2 days of emails before it was finally cancelled Its not like i was in a contract or anything Because of this I have only left 2 stars
Horrible horrible experience and I am still fighting the fraudulent charges from this company My friend warned me that she had the same problem but only after I told her I had ordered It has been a month and I still have never received the item I ordered despite my attempts to make contact They keep sending BS emails stating that oh we are sending or it has been sent or we will issue you a refund now saying they have to submit the request for refund and then it takes 10 days Do yourself a favor and never order from here Worst customer service ever they will take your money and never send you anything
UPDATE TO AMICLUBWEAR REPLY YES YOU HAVE SENT ME THREE EMAILS INDICATING YOU WOULD RETURN MY MONEY AND NEVER HAVE
We were flying into Chicago so I put OHare as the rental center We got a great price and was happy until we got to the rental car facility They said the reservation had been made for the downtown facility and not the airport At 5am after a red eye flight we did not want to get a cab downtown so we ended up paying over double for our rental car We will probably not use this site again
This has to be the most awkward way I have ever experienced to adjust a policy or for that matter to try and get response  you have to go on line wait on a live chat lin that keeps getting cut off and when you do get through they cant really help they tell you someone will ring you back  2 hours later someone rings and then they send out emails with statement of fact etc with the wrong info on  JUST HAVE SOMEONE ON THE PHONE THAT KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE SOING AND DO IT THERE AND THEN THIS IS 2 DAYS LATER AND IM STILL TRYING TO JUST CHANGE CAR ON MY POLICY
the flowers were not delivered money was taken so I would say BAD

They have an advert in the Republic of Ireland at the moment on busses that to get the price stated in the advert you have to be a 54 yearold postman with your 59 yearold wife insured as a named driver with a 2016 Renault
Maybe you guys would consider doing it for the average person and give your more crappy realistic 2 year prices
I cannot give a full review since it was hooked up 3 days ago So far the only thing we have noticed is the water has less taste
Worst customer service While booking my ticket I selected xx as my seat When I checked out for some reason the seat selection fell off and was advised to select the seat for extra charge Called up CS and they never tried to understand the issue rather kept giving me a standard bht response
Booked hotel and car rental through them for my holiday in cancun  It has been a nightmare and has cost me a lot of money paying out more money to change insurance for car rentals etc avoid at all costs or regret it it on holiday
I didnt receive my order and I didnt get my money back all they keep saying your order 7 to 20 days its been two months
Website stock status not accurate Poor customer service
2nd time I order something 2 day shipping and it gets delayedif I order on a Tuesday it should be shipped Wednesday and arrive Thursdayplease get it together or you lost a costumer
I have purchased many sets of tires from Town Fair Tire and have always had a good experience with them however my last visit was not good I went in on a Saturday to have them balance and rotate my tire after putting the first 5000 miles on them I also requested a four wheel alignment After an hour and a half wait my car was ready I pulled out of the lot and immediately sensed something was not right when I got on the highway and let go of the wheel the car pulled hard to the right I turned around and went back to the store and informed the staff that there was a major problem with the alignment they tried two more time unsuccessfully to align my car As it turns out they do not have the correct tools to align a newer Mercedes and I am now having to go spend more money at the dealership to get it properly aligned They never told me this and just kept trying the same thing over and over I will still buy tires there but will never let them touch the alignment again
I ordered X Large thigh support based on the recommenced sizing guide which arrived promptly The product did not stay secure on my thigh and i returned for a Large size again prompt delivery at no cost to my self The product still moves around on movement of my leg and will only stay secure with a lighter weight elasticated thigh support underneath Ive now stopped using the product and have wasted the purchase price
I ordered two times and both times I was really surprised because at least half of my order was totally unwearable  very poor fabric not elastic I mean I should at least breathe normally in a dress I ordered same size but their sizing is complete disaster some super small and others super large On a skirt there was a zip broken and if I returned it I would have to pay for it  they charge for returning the items like it is customers fault And at the end  most of the photos of the items they are selling is not even close to what you get I DO NOT recommend and will not buy there anymore
I could never get my question answered
Pas du tout satisfait
Awful service They still have my old address and they refuse to change it Even after I called them they refuse to change it You suck groupon Never will buy from you again
Ordered everything and all fine
Get an email on the day my order is due to be delivered to say there is an issue with the order One of the shirts I had selected was apparently not compatible with the printing I wanted They then suggested an alternative to which I responded and said Yes please proceed It took me a further week to get hold of someone and tell them to complete the order when I did there was little apology no offer to bring the delivery forward and no incentive for me to place an order with them ever again In the end my product arrived 10 days late and I had to do all the leg work to sort it out Not impressed
Now it was a very simple logo and only one colour so my thoughts are this
1 Why was I allowed to choose that garment in the first place
2 Why did it take until the day of DELIVERY to tell me there was a problem
3 Why did I have to do the legwork to sort it out They said to respond to the email  I did and that reply clearly sat with noone actioning it or keeping me in the loop
The product is good Customer service is crap Wont be using again
I ordered a set of pots and pans from Groupon One pan came damaged and a lid was missing I contacted Groupon immediately to see if I could get the pan and lid replaced Someone contacted me and told me in one paragraph that they could not replace the items but if I wanted to keep the items as is they could give me a refund to my original form of payment Then in the next paragraph said they could give me a Groupon credit I emailed back to ask for clarification and a completely different person responded and told me they were sending me a return label to return my items Im totally confused It sounds like their employees dont work together and dont know who is or has already answered emails They completely ignored my question and I havent heard from them in a couple of days Beware of purchasing from Groupon you might have damaged or missing items and a new employee will respond to your concerns with a different answer each time
i ordered some headphones from this company but still have not received them a month later They have given a tracking number to track the parcel but I called the shipping company who have said they have never received any package from the company Under no circumstances order from this company as they do not deliver the goods but take the money
We asked for a Ford Explorer and it wasnt ready for us He asked if we wanted a third seated car we said no and he give us one anyway We switched for something else and it was dirty on the outside and have had to put windshield cleaner in it right away We signed up for Avis as we always do but got Budjet rent a car Not happy having a car for three weeks that we dont care for John Shea
Horrible customer service rude
Didnt help me with my order when o called them with the issue
Careless
It was a worst insurance what i had in ireland after 1 year ncd we got a same price insurance offer then whitout and they said  because insurance prices is incraised
I was to get a 20  discount since I did not complete my order on the first visit
The discount never happened
I had the worst experience ever with GLS Customer service is super rude and not helpful at all and its charged 080min Delivery dates are not reliable nor the time  youre supposed to make yourself available from 9AM to 6PM And the courier showed up at 7PM Not to mention I was supposed to be delivered the day before But the delivery never came so I lost the entire day Run away from this company
Let me start by saying my in store experiences were 5 star across the board Ive bought furniture from Gardner White 12 yrs ago  I still love the furniture  customer service in store for me is above 5 star status Ive never needed warranty on the living set that included sofalove seat 2 end tables  1 coffee table but over time everything gets dated I just moved into a 2036 sq ft home that need new everything from living roomdinning roomdenbedroomofficekitchen  outdoor I know people are saying whats the problem the problem is When I say Dont step on the carpet even if I didnt say it cost me with padding 320000 and you step on it anyway I didnt get the name of the African american but in other words the black man Who purposely stepped on it theirs no way you can accidentally step on the carpet when the entrance is bigger than the furniture being deliverd the vestibule or hallway where I specifically said to put the furniture so they dont get rain and mud in  on the carpet but the black guy to me as to say I dont care what you want my job is to drop this crap off however I want regardless what you want this is my job so screw you I never want to see him again on my property Im really considering getting a full refund  going somewhere else where the delivery personal as a whole represent the company as well as the sales persons I will call Gardner White after work on March 272017
I use Thalys twice a month and its fair to say that the wifi a joke Please do not communicate this as a USP because in reality its frustrating to find out your rebooting more than you should have been working
On my yesterday trip the 1234 from Amsterdam to Brussels got cancelled without any communication whatsoever
You get access to the next train but no guarantee for seating so not able to get any work done either Looking for alternatives
No number to call Kind of weird The store front in Vancouver doesnt exist Again sketchy I did receive my glasses fast and an email back when I did want to return them The Ray Bans appear to be authentic glasses
If I were able to rate this agency lower than 1 star BELIEVE ME I WOULD There has to be about only 5 people working here I booked a flight for 3 people and was guided by one of the reps to cancel my existing flight through another agency because he could give me a better deal Of course me wanting to save money I went ahead and canceled my flight through the other agency to reserve 5 seats through this one When I tell you it has been nothing but HELL dealing with these people who barely speak any English I was fortunate enough to at least receive 3 of my tickets which by the way to 7 hours just to receive a confirmation and am still waiting for my last few tickets To avoid the hassle stay FAR AWAY FROM THIS AGENCY Not fraud but definitely not professional or organized enough to help book party of more than ONE

After reading reviews on here after booking I realised my situation with this company was not unique at all We booked with them as we have used them previously with no issues As all other reviews say they took payment as soon as you press buy on their website but then you receive a booking request email and are asked to wait up to 48 hours for this to be confirmed It has been longer than this for me and I have still not had my booking confirmed
Unfortunately our booking is actually very last minute as we booked for a package next week I have rang customer service twice now to see if the booking will be confirmed or not as if it will be cancelled then I will just book with someone else However the customer service team has no power and cannot give you a straight answer other than to just wait longer for someone else to apparently contact you Yesterday I was promised that someone would email me by the end of the day as a matter of high priority Today I was promised someone would contact me by noon as a matter of high priority The customer service line seems highly scripted with the operators saying whatever you want to hear to get you off the line The operators seem like they couldnt care less about the fact that their company has broken trading standards by using false advertisement and when speaking to customer service they have never once apologised for the situation lastminute has caused me to be in
Lastminute is disgraceful for customer service and I would never ever use them again I dont think they realise that people have lives and dont have the time to sit around ringing them up for days trying to chase a holiday booking which should be easy enough to confirm With any luck they wont confirm my booking so I never have to have any dealings with them again
TLDR DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM
RUN RUN RUN AWAYcan not get them to stop spamming me after a bad experience with a malware laden download
The company Ticket City sold me 3 tickets to a premium game at Fenway Park The tickets prices were high because this was the game where David Ortiz was to have his number retired in a ceremony at the game
When I purchased the tickets the seat selection was not disclosed When I got the tickets I found out through several virtual view sites that the seats were obstructed by a pole
When I communicated this to TicketCity they told me at first that they people for whom they were selling the tickets would have to agree to exchange them then later they told me that this was an issue with the Red Sox and because they did not write obstructed view on the ticket I could not exchange tickets Then the company told me they would resell my seats and take a 10 commission
This was the worst experience I have ever had with a broker I have dealt with many national and local brokers and in no previous case have I had any issues when something wasnt exactly right They simply do not want to take money out of their pocket and were unwilling to take back the tickets and exchange themkeep in mind this event is over 3 months away
I hope my credit card company can get involved hereover 1000 to sit with a pole blocking my view Had the seats been disclosed I could have done my homework to find this issue but their policy is not to disclose seat location only the row and section
I would not recommend this company to anyone
I had bought the multi size with show lables and ended up wasting most of the because they cam off when washed and dried Did not stick to bottle nipples and the bundle didnot indicate witch lable were for what Not happy with the product I have heared so many good reviews on these particular lables and they are just nothing special
You offers a price that is not true this boots was today for the president day a the half of price only to induce to buy because at the end the price was more than usual inclusive more expensive that others store

I made a purchase recently with AMIclubwearcom and spent over 100 on swimsuits I made sure I read the size chart to prevent any sort of return or refund I get my items and they are made SOOOO SMALL I couldnt even get them over my thighs and Im not even a bigthick woman The measurements couldnt possibly be accurate When I visited the site again to find out how to do a return or exchange I find out that there are NO REFUNDS OR EXCHANGES Now I get the sanitary part when it comes to trying on things like swimsuits and undergarments but had the measurements on the size chart been accurate the items would not have been too small So given that the swimsuits run small yet they made no notation of it and this clearly wasnt an error on my end I decided to write them and ask if there were possibly an alternate solution because come on sometimes things do not fit and need to be returned or exchanged at the least Not to mention the fact of WHO JUST WANTS TO TAKE THEIR MONEY AND THROW IT DOWN THE DRAIN but I get an email which seems to be a duplicate of a section on the return policy when it comes to swimsuits lingerie etc stating that my request was denied Did I not ask for an alternate solution Where was the reply to that Oh let me guess that WAS the answer to that question Why of course it was So I can spend my money with them but they cannot work with me on ANYTHING regarding this order I might as well had taken my money and just flushed it down the toilet Now Im stuck with swimsuits I cant do anything with and basically a loss of over 100 Do yourselves a favor and DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY Now they want me to enter my order number for this review so that they can identify me and make it easier to reply to my review I did that in the email I sent to them when I first wrote to them Maybe theyll have another copy and paste for me again when I do Ugh Utterly disappointed
I asked if I could get cheaper Your rep said no
When I hung up I found 20 cheaper
I have no one contact me so what was the point of your service
several excellent choices with major companies easy to book
Got one package and no word on the next long delivery wont do this sight again the old hook and bait really one month when I paid you in full  You need to start using buy now pay later for this site and you can be on the other foot ugh
Came to your site to redeem some points and it took hours Couldnt find your phone number on the site when the credits wouldnt work and had to finally Google your phone number Then got an off shore customer service person would love if you guys employed Americans who was helpful and had to break up my credits in order for me to use them This is all too much confusion for a simple order Took all the fun out of shopping 
America Rental in Cancun changed their policy regarding insurance and require an actual letter from Credit Card Company with name and credit card number and what insurance the credit card covers Without it they want to charge for both the CDW LP and increased liability 30 day
Waived the CDW and Loss Prevention and they wouldnt accept without a letter from my bank  they rented to me last year with the standard insurance certificate What a frustrating experience
I placed an order on Feb 16th and they didnt even ship it until Feb26 10 days days later It is 31 and the contacts have still not arrived
Prices are good but my contacts have been on backorder and not available for the past 2 purchases in 1 year I have had to use glasses since they cannot ship me contacts as expected
If you need contacts quickly do not shop here
I completely agree with Alex review 24117 about Hostelworld not publishing any reviews that mentions bed bugs It happened to me twice in the past year and my reviews were not published Although lve had no other problems with their services at all l think it is only fair to let people know about the fastidious bed bugs I am one of the 30 of the population who gets a horrible reaction from these creatures bites and l find it that hostels are not taking this increasing problem seriously Hostelworldcom making alowance for such hostels only makes it worse
I have been completing several student loan repayments that are fee free I have been charged a fee on several of the transfers I have raised the issue with customer service and it has been ignored I would like the fees that should not have been charged to be refunded
It was very dirty place and the job was huge and the money i get was less But i did a great job there  But im definitely not happy there  So i thought all the sucker only want to be part of this task  I have decided not to do any task for anybody unless the pay and the task is equally balance
This is ridiculous I signed up and since that day I received like a dozen spam emails I have unsubscribed from 5 lists already but Im still getting their spam I will never buy from this site
Had to finally order OEM parts from Toyota to get my truck back up and running Sometimes OEM is best especially when it cost you money time and no wheels for a bit
they say its free but fail to tell you its only free for 14 days then they charge you an armand leg i know that they look stuff up for you but they set on thier butts to do your not doing mannel work where its going to hurt you why cant you be at least cheapier some people cant affored to pay your prices
Furniture arrived broken one piece left behind redelivered 3 times Missed work lost wages due to delivery not on time Poor explanationcommunication Everyone I called blamed someone else redirected my call several times Did not get the proper price adjustment so I called again transferred 3 times and was told only my sales person could help who was not in Much time wasted on my part with little results Ready to send back my furniture and never shop Gardner White again and telling whoever I can about this bad experience

I have been emailing Goldcar for several weeks for the charges levied on me after returning the car They have clearly not read the emails carefully nor looked at the photographs and the scanned documents On collecting the car you have to sign at the desk in the airport in my case a document that stated that the car had no marks On leaving the airport to collect the car in the car park it was covered in marks on all sides You cannot get back into the airport and the office in the car park was closed I photographed the damages and went back to the airport the following day the attendant checked the car and agreed there was a number of substantial marks and he amended the documentation After returning the car at the end of the rental it was checked and I was told everything was fine I got home and found 300 Euro charge against my credit card for damage to the vehicle the only answer I get is that I signed for the car which stated no marks
I have put all of this in a number of emails and never had a response Interestingly they have responded to the poor review on here within 16 hours  but cannot respond to an email within 4 weeks
Customer Care I dont think so  dont rent from them they will charge your card after you have left the country and not respond to any queries

I just dont think that shipping should be so high if youre spending over 100 dollars with your company
Well where do I startyou have to realise this is a broker and you are not dealing a garage service
1 Cost you get Quote d will not be the cost you pay Went with Servicing Stop because I thought I was getting a good deal Booked what I thought was a Full Servce for a Range Race Rover only to find out once the vehicle was in the garage that a lot more other work would be requiredcost went up 150 If you are expecting a service that will not impact on your warranty then you need to make sure you know what you are gettingI worked after today that it would have been cheaper to go direct to my local Range Rover specialist Problem is you dont find these things out until after your car has been collected and with the garagehard to say no without having more hassle getting it to another garage and paying more labour costshave you over a barrel a bit
2 Bit of a lottery where your car goesOnce booked you get an email back telling you which Servicing Stop garage your car will be going togreat but when you Google to check reviews outgarage does not existthat because its not theirs but an independent Yes if lucky the address will match one but if several on the same street then a bit of a lottery Luckily for me I couldnt fault the one used but I can see other peoples pointquality could be hit and miss
3 Payment  you pay to get the car released and invoice only shows basicswhich is a fair one but when the invoice shows all of your Quote d costs just on labour and a 0 against expected parts to be fitted you then need to waste time calling to make sure these have been doneclearly if a seasoned user then this will not be an issue In addition watch out for the 25 off your next service easily missed when paying until you get an email thanking you for it I would prefer this offered after I had the car backif I was happy then would certainly take it upbut in my case had to ask for it back before I even got the car backagain having to ring them
4 Great reviews on their site Thats because you have to make them before paying seeing invoice and getting car back What Surely like every other service provider on the planet you would ask for this after you are sure you are happy with everythingin this case when you get your car backSmoke and Mirrors Hence using this site for a post service review
5 Customer Servicewell Im still awaiting a call back ref some work I asked to be carried outdespite having the car back 3 hours also very easy to get my 25 back so I assume this is a common ask Hate to think if I had to ask something technicalbut what do you expect from a Middleman Company
6 Would have been 1 Star but at least the garage was great so an extra 1 for you Servicing Stop but dont expect any return businessBye
the support is painfully slow and fully incompetent dont buy there terrible service
The shoes are stylish no doubt The return policy is just not worth dealing with this company for myself To many other options and easy free returns on Amazon prime
The dress was uneven and the material was of poor quality
After telling us wrong date table would be in
Update your software Amoma Users beware  that great deal has already been taken but Amoma wont tell you until you click on book as I found out Then to add insult to injury about an hour later Amoma sent me a coupon for 5 off the same room leading me naturally to wonder if it had become available Never mind how did Amoma decide it had permission to email me since I had unclicked the marketing box
Curious I clicked on the offer only to get Sorry Hotel XX isnt available and a list of other hotels Sorry to get your hopes up sucker But maybe we can get you to book one of our other offers
Amoma you have just bought yourself free negative publicity on all my social media streams and a lifetime of bad word of mouth If you last that long
Thats just one of many stressful situations Ive endured since Friday
They sent me a mail asking for a review and offering
me 10 I just want my van back and never have to deal with this bunch of sharks ever again

i ordered one right wrist support and one left I was sent two right side
We went to home zone to get a table set we were greeted immediately The service was excellent until time to check out We were there for nearly 3 hours and there was couple there that arrived after us and they had an issue and everyone that was helping me just stopped doing so We finally got our order put in and left A week later when our furniture is suppose to be in I called homezone on Tuesday to check I was told it wasnt in but another truck was coming the next day and to try back then I received a called Wednesday telling me the that a table they do not sell anymore was ordered instead of the one I chose So now I have to wait another week for a kitchen set that I really need I wouldnt have mind the wait if I was kept engaged and reassured that things were happening but instead it feels like I lost 2 hours so they could talk to friends that came in or help others
1we waited for more than one hour to pick the car up 2I have rented a big car but I have taken the small one 3there was no GPS in your office and we have a terrible situation with dawnlaoded map Actually my family and I are not satisfy with your company  
Within 2 minutes they told me the car I had paid for was not available and offered me 2 cars instead of 1 How can I drive 2 cars at the same time No contact details only no reply email address
Waste of space
Leave alone
Shipping said free right until I clicked check out It then charged me and extra 495 I do not appreciate hidden fees
these anal beeds hurt me lol
There were 5 guys behind the counter and the store was empty
Not even one of them came out to assist I had to keep going back me forth from the counter to ask questions and get assistance
Signed up over 4 months ago  no communication since
Before I bought my car I asked would I receive my plates on the spot once I purchase my car and was told yes Then when I bought my car I would told that they were out of license plates for the state of Wisconsin and that I would receive it within 2 weeks Its going over a month and I still have yet to receive them Then when I called the manager was sooo rude
Terrible stay away
Normally good customer service Not so good this time I will have to rethink dealing with them in the future
Product did not work as advertised

too expensive and unfriendly
TicketCity prices were ridiculously high The face value of the ticket was 36 I purchased 3 tickets that cost me in excess of 250 INSANE
I purchased tickets for an Arsenal v Leicester game in October The game has been cancelled and is being rescheduled for an undetermined date Im from Canada and visiting London on vacation for the purpose of going to this game They refuse to give me a refund and there is no phone number to contact them and the online contact the people arent even English Horrible and an absolute scam Sent 3 emails with no response I just want my money back and they say the seller doesnt get the funds until I get the tickets  which I havent so theyre shouldnt be an issue And they say the game hasnt been changed but it has They advanced in the FA cup so the game is not on the same date anymore You can check the website Zero customer service keep telling me to resell the tickets I purchased since they wont issue a refund yet they make it so I cant even resell them on the site Tell me to send in a form and Ive sent 4 with no reply and the live agents are a joke and dont help
BUYERS AND SELLERS BEWARE
Price of insurance doubled this year even though I have no claims
Once again my insurance disc wasnt issued in time meaning I could not drive my car for roughly a week as I would not be displaying insurance When I rang up I was told it was for me to check with the postman which I find to be unacceptable customer service
It cost me 4000 for them to haul the old sofa in order to have room for the new sofa They shattered my decorative glass storm door However I love the new sofa Now I have to wait for Gardner White to call me about my storm door
Not a satisfactory customer experience Town Fair Tire in Searbook NH is bad at scheduling customer appointments They consistently run 15 hours or more behind at least in the afternoon But not only this they are not truthful with their customers They claim to get started right away and the claim that work takes 15 hours for 2 tires while it does not They are trying to get you to believe that wait time equals work time As a minimum I would expect them to be honest An apology would also go a long way
Went into riverton store one evening about 815 Three sales guys laughing and talking at front Never a word from them Actually thought they were customers since lounging on furniture and talking loudly Found couch I wanted in back Another sales guy looking at his phone while lounging on matching love seat to the couch I wanted Took pic of couch and tag and he finally said I could call in with the item number to ask questions Not impressed at all with any of them
will mark you future communications for spam Should have had no future communication as choice on the email
I got a letter in the mail saying that my 12 bill cycle contract was about to end and that Id be contacted about upcoming pricing I was never contacted so the first time I learn about the rate change is in my electric bill Cost me 40 more just that month So I jumped online to renew I didnt feel like shopping only to find out it would take another 2 weeks Huh Im already a customer you cant just change my rates effective immediately If I called it would probably be different but I chose my avenue of communication and stuck with it
Also a warning about billing cycles When I first switched over they did it 5 days before my regular billing cycle ended Not sure why since one of the questions they ask is When does your billing cycle end So those 5 days ended up being billing cycle 1 while the other 11 were full months They obviously honored their contract but in a BSy sorta way
Ordered a Sports watch for A25899 cancelled it 30 seconds later and it would not cancel
Then contacted the online support was told they could not cancel it and I would have to wait till it shipped to be cancelled After shipping still not cancelled
Tried to cancelled numerous times over the next couple weeks even called the UK twice no help just more baloney
Eventually at about 25 weeks it turns up at my door step just left there I didnt even sign for it Talked to them again and they said I would have to post it back and wait till it arrived for a refund
In short I ended up giving as a gift as I already had purchased another watch for a local outlet
CONS
DELIVERY  After paying the 2999 fast postage it still took 25 weeks
CANCELLATION  I cancelled after 30 seconds online continuous trying to cancel both written and verbal to no avail
NOT LOCAL they lead you to believe their local however there not goods ship from overseas
sorry guys I hooked this product up and they work and then they dont waste of sixty bucks wish I wouldnt of ordered them
Driver did not show up on scheduled pick up day Eventually showed up the next business day
The staff was not helpful at all the car seemed beyond old and it was dirty
Terrible experience would never use them again
OK the rental costs are on the face of it competitive but a word of warning Be prepared for some strong arm tactics from an once friendly sales agent when you decline their additional insurance Taking advice form moneysavingsexpertcom I purchased the additional insurance to cover all the stuff Goldcars dont cover and was met with a degree of aggression that could lead you to part with cash just to escape the torrent of lies designed to scare you into buying from them Also be warned that if unavoidably you cant return the car with a full tank there is a 50 euro fine on top of the cost of the top up of fuel I did mean to ask if it was possible to pay for the fuel up front which some companies offer but was so taken aback by the trashing of my Allianze additional and lower cost insurance that I forgot to ask the 7 feet tall bloke on the other side of the counter  he was 57 sitting down Also they block 1100 euros on your card for damage etc so its important you get the cover for that in advance and at a proper rate not their massively expensive rate Other than that the car was great nearly new and not a thing wrong about it Good Luck
Please note the reply from Goldcar below
The respondent has clearly not read what I said in my review of their appalling service
I note that an additional 97 Euros was added to my PrePaid invoice at the time of rental  I was not advised that this would happen and did not notice until after I read the Hire Agreement that was shoved at me at the time of hire I was ONLY advised about the 1100 euro block
I spoke to Goldcar customer service and was told that the 97 Euros is added routinely to the account in the expectation that the car will not be refuelled What a load of utter rubbish
1 Dont use Goldcar unless you absolutely have to
2 Dont buy their insurance over the desk under any circumstances
3 Buy your additional cover from a reputable insurance company in the UK
4 Ignore the scare tactics made by the sales agents at the desk
5 check the amount you are going to have blocked against your credit BEFORE you sign the electronic pad
6 If you have time fill  top up IMMEDIATELY before you arrive at the return point otherwise you will be rooked for the 50 euro penalty
7 In summary  DONT USE GOLDCAR
Apparently my past away dad had a profile on this dating site when he was alive He was married And faithful Apparently he is watching me from heaving disapproving with my fianc and me wanting me to create a profile two years after he passed away
Twoo probably tricked him into creating an account not asking for permission spamming his contacts
I ordered a bike for my partners birthday and was pleased with the price and promptness of delivery
Upon assembly we noticed damage to the thread of the left hand pedal and therefore couldnt put the pedal on
I emailed customer service and within 10 minutes we had received a phone call to both my dad and myself
However the customer service representative was clearly on the offensive and tried to trick us into admitting responsibility and had zero intention of helping solve the issue Once I ended the conversation he phoned me back 10 minutes later to once again have a go and ended up telling me to man up  That is appalling customer service and downright insulting
Please do not buy from this company they are an absolute disgrace
The service in this website is awful Do not order from here I ordered an item on 7th March and paid extra for delivery 12 that stated 34 business days So I should have received my package by at least the 14th March It is now 22nd March and I have still not received my item And now the customer service are ignoring my messages of enquiry and marking my correspondence as resolved when it is not as I still do not have my item I would stay away from this website
Energia is an energy supplier I expect Energia to supply electricity and that is it I dont want emails selling me things emails for reviews emails for surveys Just supply energy as cheaply as possible nothing more nothing less
No more Groupon
They have so many rules in there terms it unreal do not buy as if you ever try and move they trick you into thinking you have closed your account then hit you with a bill for 3040 what a scam
Awful experience with this company They are Chinese and so you must pay huge customs tax on the orders They said they would provide me with at least 20 money back on tax When I did pay it they refused to pay me the 20 Then said I could not have the refund as I bought it a year ago when it was not even 5 months Their policy is no cash refund if after 30 days but DHL do not send customs invoice till 2 months later and tailor4less knows this Avoid at all costs Or have an over 100 customs tax bill

What can I say Had booked up several flights for a trip to Bologna Flights competitively priced everything seemed Aok till friend asked to be added to trip Couldnt get seat on same flight back so booked later flight HOWEVER after booking confirmation email showed me to have booked a flight with an 18 hour stopover in Amsterdam not the 4 hours or so I had booked
I immediately attempted to contact eDreams by their number 0333 300 0297 I phoned frequently and at length sometines holding listening to stupid music for an hour I also used the facebook messenger link which said Typically replies instantly  It never replied at all Totally wasted one day though having done google searches on the company my heart sank when I see the multiple and severe complaints about them
Next day couldnt phone as I was on a hill walk all day Then yesterday I phoned and phoned again then suddenly to my amazement got an answer from a lady called Shradha Things did improve a bit after this point I explained the situation She said she would check with the carrier  no chance of amending flight Refund for cancelling would almost be wiped out by cancellation charge At least she was friendly calm and did a little to help I knew I was on a loser despite being certain the flight they booked for me was not the flight I booked if you know what I mean She did agree that best idea might be to keep flights as far as Amsterdam then book new flight from there which is to cost an extra 50 She also explained there is a claim form which I should fill in I do not expect a slim dime back despite this not being my mistake
She also checked my previous booking and reassured me everything with them is 100 ok definately all booked
So what can I advise Well I am at least a bit more reassured about our other flights but to be honest think things still could go wrong so will be praying with fingers crossed and carrying lucky white heather till we are home Thanks eventually to Shradha for little help but I presume you must be the only person who works in the department Sorry but have to score eDeams as minus five star and in honesty would not recommend anyone to take a chance with them despite the attraction of a cheaper deal
This company is a disaster They canceled my wifes flight with LATAM and are constantly saying they are finding her a new one Her original flight was Wednesday 32917 and the flight they were suppose to get her was for 33117 It is now a day before her supposed departure date and they have not confirmed her flight They keep her on hold without providing any help She is now stuck in another country and they dont even know if they can help her How is she expected to pay for hotels without any notion of when she will have a flight Supposedly the department that can help is closed in the middle of the business hours Unacceptable I hope this serves as a warning to anyone looking to purchase This company should be sued
I ordered a large bouquet but the flowers that were delivered looked very much like a regular size bouquet you get at any supermarket Most of the flowers were still not in bloom making it all look Terrible Very disappointed
My initial experience with pond 5 was great However after spending around 900 on videos I received an email stating that they wanted to make sure I got the correct license and needed to speak immediately It felt like they saw I had a budget for a video and so they felt entitled to more money There was NO chance they would call and say that they charged too much and I was owed some kind of refund Will not be using them again
I bought three sets of plugstunnels
within the first week on one set of tunnels the back of them just cracked and now cannot be used
one came a size too small
and the last pair the were the rose gold heart plugs the heart is so big it looks like im wearing dangley earing rather than a fitted 16mm look
anyways I dont know what I was expecting for the price I paid I guess
the Kia Cerato would idle really high then quickly go back down to 0 the traction on the tyres were awful wasnt even speeding going 60kms in a 110km zone on the freeway due to heavy rain and the tyres traction couldnt cope the radio kept changing every 3 seconds
Saving a few dollars was not worth 9 days of being without a car Should have been told that it would take from Saturday until late the 2nd Monday to receive the part Next time I will pay a couple dollars more and not be carless
This booking was a nightmare from start to finish We were told to pick up in Sydney then pick up at the airport Pick time was 2pm then 9am then 11am
We arrived at 1110am to be told the pick up time was 2pm and to go away for 3hrs and return at 2pm We had to sit in airport arrivals with all our cases for 3hrs
We returned and started the paperwork Angela was as rude during this process as she had been earlier I asked to hire a GPS only to be told you didnt have any I am a foreign visitor with no knowledge of your countries roads Angela helpfully said It is only 2 straight roads to Melbourne what is the problem The problem was I wasnt going direct to Melbourne I was touring the east coast for 3 days Angela didnt even offer a map or directions to a garage to buy a map
To top it all I refuelled the car prior to returning and find I have been charged an extra amount to refuelreally
Safe to say I am not impressed with Red Spot I have always used Enterprise for car hire but never again
Buy nothing from Systems4you they let you pay but you will not get the product I ordered a remote control and paid the price shipping now it has been several months and nothing happens Systems4you has promised via email twice the product is sent but its just lies I have the police notified the company of fraud and I recommend that you all do the same and write your experiences on the Internet so these impostors can not deceive others
I am disappointed with the services I get charged without even connected
I tried several times calling a number and the phone was just ringing when I disconnected and checked my balance on my account it had reduced
I topped up my account and I had a balance of 1300 but during the conversation I had a message saying I had only 100 left and few seconds later I was disconnected saying I have no balance left I logged back on the account and I had balance showing 1197
I called IT to change a reservation and the line was cut while I was waiting It still charged to my card despite the fact that I was not even able to speak to anyone
Be careful
i have emailed them a number of times with no word back i recieved a phone in the post which still contained the original owners photos and contant list  including kids photos  and original sim card  as a mother if i found out someone had access to photos of my children  CEX state they wipe phones clearly not they violated a breech of privacy I have tried to contact a few times regarding this and the only email i recieved was to send the phone back i paid for a phone i needed and now that the phone wont hold charge its useless to me the only option i was given was to send it back and await another 12 weeks for something to be done  disgraceful considering im a regular customer

I placed an order for the midsize Mugs of Bloom bouquet along with a balloon and a full size card that was supposed to be delivered yesterday When I callled Avas a little before 7pm because it had not arrived yet I was placed on hold then told they could not get a hold of the driver and that it would likely be delivered today I was already upset about this but then this evening when I checked in with the recipient and was told she did not receive the balloon and when I asked about the card and she sent me a picture of the usual tiny floral cardand THEN she sent me a pic of the arrangement she received which looked absolutely NOTHING like what I orderedI am friggin LIVID Never again will I order from this place I want a full refund AND they should deliver the CORRECT order at no charge I was hoping to use this service on a regular basis but there is no way that will happen within this kind of horrible service

CAUTION  Never rent a car at Goldcar
Goldcar does not mark cars scratches in their own papers
Goldcar cheats conscious of hidden fees gasolin consumption and currency exchange rates
Goldcar are some scammers and fraudsters that I strongly discourage to use
I booked flights 6 months in advance booked specifically for the time The company Air Canada changed the flight times to an untenable flight time Air Canada told me to speak to the Travelgenio I spoke with Travelgenio the man I spoke with was very hard to understand and offered no help whatsoever apart from you can apply for a refund but you might not get it
Well I need a flight as it is a connection flight I asked if they could make another booking with another company who I saw on their website had flights at a suitable time with a refundable option as I cant afford to pay for 2 lots of flights and they said they couldnt do that reiterated my two options were apply for a refund or accept the flight No attempt to help I asked to speak to a supervisor and was refused then he hung up on me
Absolutely no help at all got a call recording if anyone wants to hear my experience firsthand
From the time I selected the flights the seats and entered the payment information about 6 minutes the price per ticket jumped from 301 to 349 when I clicked to confirm the booking Maybe I picked a bad time to book the flights but I am very suspicious of this price jump
Doubt that I would use this site again

Half the time there is a delay to get your keys because your account needs to be reviewed for fraud AGAIN Or the payment refuses to process at all
Would never order from this company again Terrible experience Ordered my flowers 12 days ago and still no delivery Ive emailed numerous times and keep getting the response that its the couriers fault I had to inform my receiver that she was getting flowers ruined the surprise I was told they would be delivered today and they never even contacted her I actually thought this site was a scam They took my money straight away and Ive now requested a refund no reply Do not order off this site if you wish to surprise somebody or wish for the flowers to be delivered on time A very annoyed and frustrated customer

Better off paying extra somewhere else
I booked a flight for my family just now I entered my credit card details and it I APPROVED the payment of 1650EUR but my card was charged 1844EUR How can I get charged 200EUR more than what I authorized when clicking the approved payment button
I called a representative straight away and they said 100EUR was because I didnt pay with a Maestro card and the other 100EUR was admin fees He asked if I would like a refund to which I would be charged a 60EUR cancellation fee I asked is that my only option and he said yes I said I would have to think about it and he hung up on me
I am fuming
Yup agree with R Froese same story here My parents live in an area were there are 7 highrises for seniors and another one is in construction and because of that construction the parking is reduced and the management had to install a valet in a booth You have to stop he sees that you are a delivery driver for Mickey Mouse Purolator he removes the orange cone and you drive your truck to the main door of which he obviously to lazy to do Then you walk inside press the reception button and she takes and sign for the parcel this also very hard to do for a lazy sob Twice he never attempt and played the lazy game well I closed the account and the box is on its way back and I will send it different or drive to Montreal myself and deliver it because its seems to be very very hard for a unionized idiot AND FYI PUROLATOR I AINT PAYING FOR A NON DELIVERY
Didnt fill my order but another company had no problem It doesnt matter that youre cheaper if you cant get your order filled
Really bad service and the customer agents never bother to promptly follow up with you
Ive been with Think Protection for just under a year In that time
1 the response unit took 5 HOURS to show up to my property after a false alarm was triggered by my cat with the motion sensors
2 motion sensors  they state that the motion sensor technology shouldnt pick up an animal under 40lbs My cat is DEFINITELY not 40lbs and yet hes activated the alarm twice The tech support guys have tried everything and nothing works So Ive paid for equipment that isnt being used
3 they expect YOU to pay for return postage for their useless faulty equipment door sensor this time and threaten to charge you for the replacement if you dont return the old one in time
This company wouldnt know good customer service if it slapped them in the face Emails are ignored and they dont bother to return calls or follow up Do yourself a favour and pay a little extra for more reputable security companies out there This one is a joke and not worth your hardearned money
Gave 1 star as otherwise I could not start review received my pet tag today and can only say the quality is what you would expect from the 1 store cheap thin the engraving is virtually unreadable and the ring that connects to the collar wont last 5 minutes Waste of money as I now have to buy again from a decent supplier

The quality of workmanship is excellent and great value for your money I received my glasses in less than two weeks The problem I experienced was with my prescription when I placed my order I emailed them my prescription from my recent Doctors Visit What I received was my left eye lens with no prescription I was very disappointed that they had my prescription and they could not get it right the first time When I emailed them with my problem they emailed me back with a picture of my prescription stating that they followed my prescription My prescription clearly stated to balance both my lenses so I am not sure how they could screw they up I had to send it back to them and PAY FOR RETURN SHIPPING And then they charged me another 2580 to complete my glasses and send them back to me I felt that they took no responsibility for the screw up and the apology was generic and not heartfelt Bottom line great price great workmanship got my glasses fast But customer service was very poor otherwise I would have given them a 5

We placed an order for suits for my sons wedding based on the picture represented on the Black Tux website We called in and spoke to the representative who assured us that the navy suit was in fact the color represented in the photo So we placed our order When we received the suits they were almost black and not the lighter navy blue with gray tones shown in the photo I immediately called Black Tux and were told that there is nothing they can do about the misrepresentation in the photo or what the representative originally told us They basically bait and switch and then less than two weeks before the wedding can only offer a refund rather than appropriately correct the problem Its very clear that trying to do this online is not appropriate They have left a disappointed wedding party stranded I understand the positive reviews I believe they have grown fast and cant stay ahead of their business If they started offering a different color navy suit they should have updated the photo on the website Companies that cant stay up with their demand ultimaltely end up failing Saying that you can only refund the money rather than finding a solution shows they are too busy and is a sign of desp trouble ahead
I did not have the ISBN number for the textbook I was looking for so I went on the description of the item It described the Texas textbook but when I received the item it was the laboratory activity book I attempted to return the item but they said I received the correct book Therefore I purchased a book I did not need The company was not interested in resolving this matter and have lost my business going forward

Flight hub should be mindful and have the interest of their esteem customers in mind by letting them know all the details of itinerary including layovers to avoid unnecessary delay or to avoid paying unreasonable fees for cancellation This happened to me recently and I deeply regret who I dealt with that didnt explain the facts to me and I ended up paying a huge fees for flight hub as well as the airline itself This is highly discouraging to me and this would have been avoided if I had a better representative that have explained some things to me
Unfortunately we booked and changed the pickup we emailed and called the day before and they still managed to get it wrong
To make matters worse they were 15 minutes away and refused to come and pick us up we have a 2yearold and we had booked car seat for her
the fact we had small child made no difference to them I must have asked nearly a dozen times if they would be picking us up they just kept telling me it was my fault  which it clearly was not
I have given them several opportunities to reimburse our additional costsrefund us which they have refused
I could and would never trust this company I would rather pay a little more for a reliable company and if you have children and need child seats then this is probably an important consideration for you
Had they have come back for us I would not even post this mistakes do happen it is how you deal with them that makes the difference
I ordered two items last week expected delivery was the 16th of March they still havent arrived I havent heard anything back I updated my mobile number and it is still coming up as the old one
The content of this course can  should be condensed to one hour two at the most
Rewrite the narrative so that the readers dont sound like mindless but wellintentioned aunts talking to slow learner children
Get rid of the liberal ethical hunting gibberishTurn the course into an introduction to hunting tactics focused on three types of game small game large  dangerous game and Upland Game birdswater fowl
The virtual range days can be tightened up  focused on the three game groups
No one who is considering the hunting lifestyle could be so weapons illiterate as to need the juvenile explanations on how cartridges  weapons work
I found the course to be demeaning  insulting

We booked two transfers for a recent trip to South America which started with a pick up from GIG airport in Rio de Janeiro and drop off at EZE in Buenos Aires following a cruise
The pick up from Rio was excellent with a very professional driver who was helpful and polite The vehicle was spotlessly clean and we were very pleased with the service
Things went rapidly downhill from this point onwards
We had booked a pick up from our hotel in Buenos Aires for four passengers with four suitcases We also had hand luggage which sat on our laps for on our previous transfer from GIG Our arranged pick up time was 11am At 1115am I sent an email to ziptransfers requesting an urgent response as our taxi had not arrived Ive never received a response to this email At 1125 the driver arrived He had no identification and his car appeared to be unlicensed as there were no plates to indicate that it was an approved vehicle The driver was unapologetic and in fact quite rude as he immediately indicated that he wouldnt fit our luggage into the car I went with him to look at the car which was a Renault Fluence  a standard saloon car with a very small trunk I explained that the transfer was for four people with four suitcases but he shrugged his shoulders and appeared disinterested He made a phone call to his company and then eventually passed his phone to me to speak to a customer service agent from ziptransfers who explained that the company had no other vehicles available and suggested that I arranged alternative transport
I asked the driver to attempt to fit our suitcases into the trunk and he could only fit two into the very small area I took photos as advised by ziptransfers and asked the hotel to call a taxi One hour later we were on our way to the airport which is around a 40 minute drive from central Buenos Aires Luckily the traffic was fairly light and we arrived within the required checkin time
On return to the UK I contacted ziptransfers who have been very unhelpful and would not accept that the vehicle provided was too small They have failed to confirm why the driver did not carry ID and have provided no evidence to confirm that the vehicle was licensed They have insisted that the vehicle was big enough to carry four passengers with four suitcases  Quote
 We confirm that the provided vehicle Renault Fluence is able to transport four suitcases of the maximum combined size of 140cm height  width  length in the trunk As we have received the confirmation that your suitcases would not fit in the trunk of the vehicle we have to assume that the suitcases of your group exceeded the allowed luggage restrictions of a maximum combined size of 140cm height  width  length
140cm of a combined size  height  width  length is a nonsense
I have requested a copy of their formal complaints procedure and they have stated that an email to them is sufficient to instigate a thorough investigation of the issues we had raised no policy or procedure has been provided
My request for a supervisor manager to deal with my complaint has been rejected although I have been assured that a manager has checked that the complaint has been thoroughly investigated A major annoyance is that ziptransfers have taken the word of an unreliable company and refused to accept the word of their customer
We will not be using their services again and would suggest that anyone considering ziptransfers looks at other options as this company is extremely poor at providing a transparent service and they clearly do not value their customers

1ordered 2 x XQD memory cards for two events for last weekend 25  26 February I ordered them on 15 February and at the time of writing 27th Feb I still have not yet received them I heard nothing for the first 5 days then I was sent an email on 20 Feb to say theyve been sent via recorded delivery
SEVEN days later I still havent received them
I do not believe for a second that something posted via recorded delivery takes 7 days to arrive They have given me a tracking numberit doesnt work
Im very unhappy with a 12 day wait for two memory cards at over 12800 Also theres been no communication and it took a complaint to receive an answer
Ill be contacting my credit card co for a refund
MobyMemory complained to Trustpilot about my review They said they dont recognise me as a customer This is despite me putting my FULL name in the review and my order number I am a real customer and I have sent Trustpilot proof of this
I was impressed with their website and so were my students However once we started the process of trying to order we were contacted by a different person every day sometimes multiple times a day We were never really sure who we were supposed to be communicating with We used the photo from the proof to help presell shirts we had ordered The shirts arrived and do not look like the photo Several customers complained about the look of the shirt RushOrderTees should have brought this to our attention before selling us these shirts
THEY KEEP CHARGING MY CREDIT CARD EVERY MONTH I WILL BE GOING TO THE BANK
DO NOT USE NAKED WINES
Though the price range of various flights did seem attractive it was a great disappointment to find out after confirming the purchase that manulife insurance costs had been added although I had checked NO when it appeared on the screen as well as costs for seat assignation though no seat map had been proposed nor seats assigned  Upon calling these problems were arranged though the seat assignment extras only when I asked about the extra costs 
I wanted my flags shipped by UPS only There is no place on your web site for that request
I cant call back to give extra money for shipping because your lines are always busy I have tried
several times  No place on web site to correct error My number is 3612444494 to get extra money
I had a girl call one time and left a message that they do not keep my credit card number Educate me
Ordered 24 hour leveling service  its been 2 days and Im still waiting for them to START the process Very disappointing paying for a timed service and not receiving it in the specified time is the same as only getting a partial service Cant say Id recommend in the future
The only reason I went with Fizber was to list my house on MLS which worked because it sold very quickly However since I was not a realtor I had no support on how to do the paperwork and the rest The realtor assigned to us was not very helpful because you could only email him or else he would charge 25 everytime you called So the buyers realtor had all the leverage and could totally take advantage of us If it wasnt for a realtor friend of mine helping us negotiate and fill out the paperwork correctly we would have been in trouble
I am very dissatisfied  I never received my contact company does not seem to care
So sad about that I cant find my package Its already 2weeks since they said my package success delivery 
Bought both front axles for my VW Passat one axle was ok the other was defective so I called up partsgeek and they told me to order a new one then return the junk one when it came in so I got the new piece in and it too was defective when I went to return them the ups store couldnt accept the shipping label parts geek gave me so I emailed them and they gave me another method to try that too failed so I emailed them again to try to get these axles returned and now they are no longer responding ive sent multiple emails and it has now been over a month that ive been dealing with this and I still have the 2 bad axles and have yet to be refunded for them because I cant get partsgeek to send me an appropriate shipping label if they dont send me a label I have to pay shipping to get my refund
Ordered because of good price and the promise of fast and free shipping At check out was charged for shipping and another part I ordered three days after came in same day
Was neither fast nor free Very disappointed
No matter what you call it shippings not free as advertised
Nothing going right They are not deliver on the day not deliver the flower I choose
Be careful they let you choose the day and flower online but it doesnt mean they can do work right day and things
We never use this company ever again
Deception at every step
 deposit of 1100 was charged not blocked as stated
 still waiting for deposit refund after 5 weeks and Goldcar are not responding to email
 overcharged for fuel upfront despite fulltofull fuel policy booked
I have contact the tourism office and police in Larnaca so that people are aware of the scam
This looked like it could have been really cool A good amount of options to choose from supposedly always on time
I ordered from their website for 1130am the next day Nothing shows up I called their support team and they said they would get back to me 15 minutes later they call back and say the restaurant didnt see the order Didnt offer any other options other than they can drop something off in 45 minutes I work for a company that operates via billable hours and we only have from 121 pm I would have thought that since the restaurant is on your platform you would have a way of making sure restaurants are confirmed Or just being responsive if they couldnt do the order Thats how businesses run right
Lesson learned Ill stick with legitimate businesses that are known for their
professionalism  Alonti Fooda Sopraffina etc
French press 2 out of 20 broken waiting 3 weeks for place mats still no delivery
Last couple of orders took way to long to ship
I reviewed a website and never signed up to disclose my contact info
This is the worst experience I ever had in purchasing a ticket as a frequent flyer The way I was treated will not guarantee a come back
I ordered one part but my order was duplicated 4 times and my billing address got attached to another companys orders So now I have to wait until they send me return paperwork said it would take 12 days but its now a week and I havent seen it Meanwhile they charged me 4x what I was supposed to be charged and I wont get credit until I send back the extra parts still waiting for paperwork and who knows how long after that Fix your website

Made a order on the 1602 to italy wrote multiple times used the website called them multiple times trying to explain that they did not deliver The hotline hung up on me twice and where not professionally trained whatsoever Asked for a refund which I did not get I am considering legal actions
DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE
I did not bother to look for reviews for this company and Im sorry I didnt they definitely had the cheapest fares and the time and dates I wanted they just could not deliver the tickets I got 2 messages telling me my booking was pending then 2 days later I got a refund for my tickets with some obscure explanation about timing but nothing saying I no longer had a reservation I had to call their customer service and ask I then had to go through the motions all over again again I wish I had read the reviews I have no idea how long Bravofly has been in business but one hopes it wont be much longer they are not to be trusted
most of the time its pop with try again option from yesterday its in automatically travel mode and I am not able to make calls as I am not in wifi range and cant make calls through local call option please help as i have send complaints also there is no reslults
So I payed alot of money for my ticket and they automatically charge a FULL FLEX PACKAGE where they said I could be relax knowing i will not have to pay extra money if i want cancel or change my flight THAT NEVER HAPPENED
They want me to PAY 300 EXTRA TO CHANGE MY FLIGHT AND THEY ARE NOT ADDING THE STANDARD FEE CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT
In addition THEY ONLY SEND YOU ONLY ONE OPTION TO MAKE THE CHANGE AND OF COURSE IS THE EXPENSIVE ONE AND THEY DONT CARE
Only automatic responses and WHEN YOU WHANT TO CALL THEM YOU CAN ONLY DO THAT PAYING 7 THROUGH YOUR CREDIT CARD TO TELL YOU THE SAME THING
DONT YOU EVER EVER USE THIS IN YOUR LIFE AN LESS YOU WHANT TO GET STOLEN
Its been weeks and Ive received nothing except this review form One thing you could do to mprove is to not send out review forms when customers are tired of waiting for packages Spend your time in the shipping room
I called to fix an address error Was told I had to contact usps They did not have a delivery missing parcels department When my contacts arrived all but 1 pair ripped with gentle cleaning of contact lens solution
The workers in this office were very unprofessional They played music with profanity ace the girl working the front desk had on a baseball cap to the back The lady who actually did my taxes asked me very little questions she at the end of it Im receiving the lowest refund Ive ever received although my personal invitation is pretty much the same as last year Never again
The price indicated is not the real price At start on a 300 ticket with supposed taxe included  we paid 335 because price increase at checkout and more taxes applied after I do not recommand Flight hub
After choosing and confirming my flight I reviewed then price I was paying showed so I finished the process All of a sudden an extra 77 added to my invoice for many life insurance I did not accept and had to call flight hub to reverse this transaction which I was told will take 68 weeks This happened last time with a booking Not pleased at all This extra charge is added somehow after accepting the final bill and then confirming the booking
I ordered an item that said it would be here within a week and then received an email after purchase saying it would take about three weeks to get I would not have purchased it if I knew that it would take this long to get
Not worth a comment
Place order shows it will be process and shipped out in two day which took them four days to process and shipment was held for two more days So got my order a week and two days later
Public Storage has been taking and taking more and more comforts away from customers First they took away the bathrooms located on each floor finally those were opened back up then they took away the lighting inside each locker and of course there is the general rundown look that the facility has taken on since Public Storage purchased And we cant forget that the rental fees keep rising each year So we pay more for less I would be happy to speak with a representative to air my concerns if you are interested
10 minutes later I check tracking info and it says unable to make deliveryinsufficient address information please contact
There was no attempt at delivery On the phone Im told that it is my fault for not putting a buzzer code My apartment has a big sign on the very first door that says Please input apartment number for buzzer Canada Post DHL and UPS have had no problems ever in the past understanding the sign and Ive always received shipments from them
I asked over the phone to attempt another delivery the next day I was told this was no longer possible despite their website saying to call up and schedule a delivery
I have no choice who ships my parcels from Amazon From the times that I have had my parcels shipped through Purolator I have never I really mean never received my package without a hassle The drivers dont seem to care Its an ongoing issue that others are having as well Management does not seem to care either as this issue has been ongoing for years
I have not received a response from customer care who advised me to contact them regarding these issues

Dear Reader
On Feb 14 2017 I booked a family of eight people from SFO to FCORome for the price of 696 per person I signed and paid the tickets on the same day before midnight as the agent Xavier had asked me to do On the following day Xavier did not tell me that my tickets was not issued Instead around 5 pm he told me that the tickets is not longer 696 but is now 798 All he could tell me is sorry and that he would cancel the ticket I was furious because I already purchase the cruise ticket on that same morning It is too late so I had to move forward to purchase the ticket and I had to speak to his manager Nicolas to get a discount rate for 762 but Nicolas told me I had to buy the protection insurance of 70 per person I felt this was a nightmare since these guys did a switch and bait on me As a customer I wasnt told anything about any disclaimer or told on the phone or email that ticket can change at anytime Now the ASAP ticket claims that they had told me that but only after I had gone to BBB about the issue As a customer I dont feel I am treat like a customer and that ASAP ITI is doing their best to work with me on my situation Therefore I will continue to take this matter forward because it matters to me that this company should have pay for my ticket on a timely matter so even when the prices do change up or down that as a broker working for me should honor their prices to their customer Because of company has not gone above and beyond to help me with my issue I have to rate them poorly as a customer service

Ordered a Bluray movie and paid for the 2 day shipping and it came 6 business days later The case was broken and it was going to be a Valentines day gift I was told I would be refunded the cost of shipping but I havent seen it yet Totally dissatisfied
Last night I attempted to book my parents a ticket to visit me in Calgary from Vancouver I went through all the screens and unclicked all the preclicked options for insurance etc I was given a Quote for 614 CAD including taxes and fees for the two tickets and paid for them using my credit card
This is where things started to go hairy On the confirmation page they showed an extra 30 charge for seat selection even though I hadnt preselected any seats So I call Flighthub and am reassured that my card will only be charged for 614 CAD and that the seat selection option has been removed
The next morning I receive an email stating that my reservations is on hold due to a fare change and that it will be cancelled within a few hours if I do not call them So naturally I call in to see what is going on and am informed that they want to charge me an extra 200 to keep the tickets because the fares have gone up since the time I booked and that they have not yet charged my card 
Seriously This is outrageous I was told by their agent Jaid that their website is very dynamic and that you will never know if what you see on the website is what you will be charged I was also informed that all airline websites are like this
Ive used Flighthub before and had minor inconveniences in the past but this is a game changer Never again And please spread the word so that others dont go through this waste of time COMPLETE SCAM
So I purchased two boxes of syringes with the needle but only received one box of just the needles Also cant get the priority mail turned off I just want to cheap standard shipping Most other places offer free shipping so I think Im gonna have to start using some other company
What kind of review would you like me to submit based on you sending me a survey BEFORE Ive received my order

I was waiting 20 minutes in the store before I could get hold of a staff member to help me and was then kept waiting for a similar period of time at the counter while waiting to pay for the object I purchased Extremely poor customer service
I am a 75 year old senior and I went to a Home Show A salesman for Oceane stopped me and asked if he could use a product on my face I repeatedly told him that I only use organic natural products on my face I didnt have my glasses so he read the ingredients to me and they WERE Natural But later when I got home and put on my glasses I saw that there were synthetic chemicals in with the natural ones
So he applied it to my face and I still was nervous about buying it I asked about their return policy and he assured me that Customer Service would help me So I bought it By the time I got home my face was bright red swollen and sore I immediately after taking selfies called about returning the unopened product I was told I could only exchange it But as Im obviously allergic to their product I dont want to do that So I have a very expensive unopened product and an empty wallet I so hope they will reimburse me
This site is a scam Like all the other reviews I order flowers and had the same experience
Customer Support is some guy in India who just promises the flowers will arrive the next day All of it is complete lies
If you have ordered through this company and paid with Visa or Mastercard contact your bank and request a Chargeback You can do this within 30 days of your order and your money will be refunded They will also be fined for every Chargeback which is reported

Originally I bought 2 economy tickets from Mlaga to Paris The tickets were later changed from Economy Class MlagParis to BUSINESS CLASS MlagaNew York with my acceptance of the attached penalty
Unfortunately I had to change my travel plan again and wanted to cancel the tickets according to Air Europas cancellation policy for Business Class tickets which are
Cancellations allowed up to 3 days before departure with a penalty of 200 or 250 per passenger providing the same booking class is available If the change results in a higher booking class the difference in fare must be paid Administration fees not included
12 weeks before the scheduled flight I made a phone call to AE and requested a cancellation but was told that my tickets was not refundable as the tickets were changed from Economy Class tickets to Business Class tickets and that the first ticket is determining the subsequent status for the final ticket despite the final ticket has a higher status  In other words Pay for Business Class tickets but stay on economy status
Never again 
No one come to pick up unless I called courier company
I did two tranactions and on both i had to do a claim because i did not receive my cash back I did everything correct I prefer ebates alot easier

I subscribed to an online engineering service using my company card The following month the subscription was renewed  now using my private credit card I reported the incident  and got some useless mambojumbo back that essentially means they didnt readunderstand any of my pretty simple complaint

The instore service was friendly and helpful but the delivery process was not good They were unable to make even a 4hour delivery gap and then they were missing pieces of my furniture set so I then had to make myself available for the next day without knowing if they would even show up or anywhere near the time they stated

My flowers did not arrive until a day later than the delivery date requested meaning the person I intended to receive the flowers did not I called customer services who said that they cannot guarentee delivery dates it states this on their website and it is not their policy to refund My flowers now sit with a neighbour of the intended recipient and I have wasted money plus the charges on my phone for calling their chargeable rate and being in the phone on hold for ten minutes before getting through Appalling service The supervisor I was put through to was also rude telling me they were very busy and interrupting me to state she cant help and I should have read the website When the website states in big letters order before 9am for next day delivery
not only they not keep the shipping date delay promise mine delayed double time without explanation or apology they also not reply to any of the support mails they did after 6 mails and several weeks very frustrated

Purchased a new bed on a Saturday They told us We missed the truck today so it will be on Mondays truck You can pick it up anytime Monday
I left work early we hauled our old bed out arranged a babysitter drove all over town switching cars to borrow a truck and showed up at the warehouse about 6pm and got OK that has now been requested and it will be here first thing tomorrow morning When I told them it was supposed to be here today and we need a bed TONIGHT they said theres nothing we can doI guess you could go and pick it up from the warehouse The warehouse is an hour drive ONE way and at this point we have about an hour left with our babysitter
So we went home slept on our couch and get to do the whole thing over again tomorrow Im sure my employer wont be suspicious about me leaving work early two days in a row to pick up the same bed

Pay attention when reserving I made my reservation on last Sunday 5th March late evening and I wanted to reserve an early departure around 6 am but with the combination I wanted the system kicked me out twice and had to restart booking In the end after confirmation I saw that I got the tickets to the departure of 6 pm instead of 6 am and the whole went very fast and I am sure I never clicked on the later flight it was automatically done by the system in my opinion
It is not my first online flight reservation and I know I was little bit upset but I am 100 sure i never clicked on that combination on which I confirmed later to my big surprise and then shockI wanted to call the client service immediately but it was too late 9pm Sunday so I wrote rapidly an email no answer since then and the next morning I could reach the office and someone who was supposed to help Instead I faced a very impolite and not really kind manner of service clientele and the worker almost lectured me rudely and directly that I should have paid attention more She was basically right but I wanted to express my opinion that the evening before the system of connectionsbe was not really working well and caused me lot of nervousity and i am sure I never clicked on the flight combination which i bought in the end But she did not really care instead she offered me the possibility of changing the tickets 100eur person I said no thank you and finished the conversation with bitter mouthIts not my first time reservation with this company and I know I should have paid attention but at least I could have expected something else of treatment
update I just clicked on my reservation and I just see that my inbound flight is cancelled and I never received any info about this  what is going on
I ordered 2 phone cases off of this site and 3 days after I ordered they emailed me and said one of my cases wasnt in stock at the time and gave me no refund and the other case hasnt arrived yet and it is 2 days late

I purchased 4 Hankooks and apart from being of unknown age they are in no way suitable for Australian conditions Hopeless to the point of dangerous in the wet with no grip even on level surfacesthese tyres are recommended for the Middle east and according to Hankook are not a tyre imported by them which suggests a grey import They have refused to honour the warranty so I am now going to fair trading to sort this out
I just got a promotional link to upgrade to Antivirus Pro I proceeded to purchase it However I later noticed that I am being charged for a physical CD shipped to my addressI wanted to contact Customer Service at Lavasoft to not ship the CD and take off the charges
They claim to offer 247 service I had to google their link as it is not even listed on their web site
All I got was hangups after I selected Customer Service or they offered a callback if I am a corporate client
I decided to reverse the charges and will not download the Antivirus Pro I cannot trust a company with NO support
Something does not add up
My order got rejected I dont know why
My package arrived at my boyfriends work the address I chose with my ex boyfriends name on it

Be very careful when booking your trip The system default set is for overnight air travel and it will cost you a lot of money to this changed for your plan Outside of this being a site that I can make payments I am not happy and will not recommend this site to anyone
most of the items are out of stock and the delivery charges are way too high for people living outside london Cant you make adjustments to your website so that out of stock items dont show up
There was no liquid to clean the windscreen The navigation system was not working Extremely rude personal Charging 20 for taking the car back out of office time is ridiculous
I received the flowers the correct day and was pleased however when I opened them they were mainly dull grayish colours and half dead and nothing like the picture they were squashed and starting to smell rotten absolutely Appalling for the price paid dont waste your time or money on this scam of a company
I ordered a phone and case from groupon The phone came fairly quickly but I still havent received the case yet
1 the pricing timed out when entering credit info twice Suddenly it wasnt available at that price more expensive
2 the price with taxes and fees in was suppose to be a little over 1200 my husband was sitting next to me to verify this And when it went through we were charged over 1600 But we were to exhausted to fight it after what occurred earlier that day
3 earlier that day I made a purchase and took their extended cancellation fees Thank goodness I did because when we purchased it a different flight was booked So we lost 5000 there because its for cancellation only
4 extended cancellation should give you 24 hours to change flight in case of errors without penalty 22500 per person to change I cancelled flight instead Did not want or trust to book again so husband get it and we had the issue with the cost difference
5 Your customer service were like robots
Overall not the pleasant experience and feel that I was taken advantage of between the 50 earlier that day and 5000000 in the evening Hope this isnt their usual service or treatment 
We send a lady to pick up a gift pen for a coworker at the square one location yesterday It was recommended by the store staff to engrave the name on the box instead of the penWe do not like the pen as it looks different as the one in the picture neither do we like the fact that the engrave was on the gift box that nobody keeps therefore we decided to exchange to another one We called the store and was told that we cannot returned or exchange as the box was engraved We were willing to pay for the box but was told again it is not possible I dont understand why a piece of metal that was glue on the box in front of us so irreplaceableand why we cannot return a pair of pen that is not engraved and is purchased yesterday It is very unreasonable It was the first time we purchase from store and honestly we are not impressed at all
Ordered a product from their website which is not available Ok substituted it but a week later the original product is STILL AVAILABLE TO BUY ON THE WEBSITE 
Other than that all good thanks
Over 7 days gone still no sign of what I ordered really disappointing and extremely poor service
I made 4 orders with Tomtop 2 in December and 2 in January I received two of the items quickly and am happy with the products for the price The other orders have not arrived yet one says it shipped December 25 2016 but I still have not received it the other still shows as processing since January 10th 2017 Customer service keeps trying to tell me that the items were out of stock and have just come back into stock however the sales site always says they are in stock but they have not shipped and they refuse to cancel or refund my money It is now March 10th 2017 Still waiting Tomtop this experience overall really sucks

Ordered LED bulbs all defective
Experienced all the problems others have  no phone number only method of support is to raise a ticket by email got offered a refund onto my account on the website not straight back to my credit card Products came from China asked to return them to Poland and pay the postage myself
I would advise you to STAY CLEAR OF THIS SITE
The site operators appear to suggest solutions in their responses to others but clearly do not deal with these issues as the same complaints continue
Many are Customized products but there is no place to communicate with vendor about the artwork
We are very happy with the item that we purchased however the delivery process really let down the transaction The delivery person had to be asked several times to bring the sofa into the house which has very easy access He was intending to leave the sofa on the footpath outside our house It was just fortunate that my Husband was able to help him If I had been at home I would not have been able to lift the sofa This needs to be addressed as the attitude of the delivery person was less than helpful
Cant say much about the products since I didnt received them at all Customer Service didnt do a thing to help me out Im seeing you Solan and simply stop answering my mails I was supposed to receive the two vaporizers I bought in 13 days just before I left the country After day 4 I didnt received a thing I asked for a solution and it turns out they didnt placed the order and send it while I was already away So they are keeping my money and Im left without the two vaporizers I tried to get
Charged 200 extra on my credit card for a scratch that was there before I picked up the car They didnt show me the pictures I obliged them to take before pickup claiming that there was an error in the system They didnt send me those pictures at the moment they took them as they said they would nor they sent them to me after charging me the scratch They only sent me a picture taken after I returned the car depicting the scratch I supposedly did The car was full of scratches so when I made them mark every scratch on the paper most were not marked they marked a nearby very small scratch making me believe that the small one mark was representing the big one Then they charged me 200 for the bigger one A corrupt trap and a total ripoff
I feel cheated not trusted and being used The decision to hold monies when I have held an account for several years with this Company just does not make sense or feel right I also feel that fees at Paypal are on the high side and I would like better service due to this I am sure that my money will eventtually arrive in my bank account but my score for Paypal customer service is zero
Oke so you want a minecraft server and you have noticed that GGserverscom is a really cheap host for it I am not going in detail to much because you are not here to read novels but I have rented my server there for about a month now which of i could use my server for about 15 weeks That means that 75 of the time the servers went down speaking of the france once affecting europe
The staff does absolutely NO efford to help the community with any usefull information if you ask them a question they either dont know the answer or give a pre packaged answer
Servers in france have been down for a week now and the GG staff has no clue why and are not even caring
TLDR Do NOT buy your server at GGserverscom if you want to play on a hosted server anytime you want If you consider buying your server here expect atleast 50 DOWNTIME
Hope this helps
Gives me particularly bad sleep
No wait time quick in and out and professional
Now I am really annoyed see my original message and your reply
Your tickets say ticket also includes a transit pass any Belgium station Leiden is in the Netherlands Nowhere do your tickets confirm validity in the Netherlands The words Any Dutch Station is nowhere on the tickets
Your tickets are not confusing they are simply wrong
Can you tell me if the tickets are valid in Leiden

I booked Leiden  London The email included tickets only for the Eurostar I sent an email querying the other tickets and got no reply I tried telephoning but the number was constantly engaged I had to buy new tickets Leiden to Brussels The SNCB service is really disappointing and worrying  we are both almost 80 years old and can do without such hassle

Many thanks for sharing your feedback James
We are sorry to read that you have been encountering difficulties to call our Contact Center
We also regret that it was not clear to you that your Eurostar tickets include the Any Dutch Station supplement as shown by the any Dutch station mention appearing on your ticket and in your fare conditions Your Eurostar tickets are valid all the way indeed from Leiden to London via Brussels
Your connection from Leiden to Brussels is not specifically mentioned on your ticket as this kind of ticket allows you to take any train at any time except Thalys from any station in the Netherlands to BrusselsMidi
We admit that this may seem confusing by its simplicity On the other hand this kind of ticket is not only more flexibel as it allows you to depart from anywhere in the Netherlands but also much cheaper than a separate ticket from Leiden to Brussels
Feel free to check if you can still get a refund even partially for the additional ticket you purchased  which turns out to be superfluous
We nevertheless wish you a smooth and pleasant journey
I ordered an avent steam sterlizer for baby milk bottles no confirmation email nothing after few weeks they have disabled my account I cant login to see the status and nor can i reset my password
I think I should consider that I have been robbed and forget about my money
Had ants in our room everywhere crawling everywhere
They had a huge party in the main area not even 20 ft from our door my kids where up all night long because of the huge party going on it was about 1 am before it was quiet and my 2 four year olds didnt get much sleep
And they offered no apology or compensation for the ants or the loud party we will not likely stay there again
I contacted Suntransfers to book a transfer from Amsterdam airport into the city for myself and my husband who both use a mobility scooter the ones that come apart to go in the car boot only to be told it was company policy that they wouldnt take electric scooters I have never heard anything so ridiculous in my life What harm can a mobility scooter do The airlines have no problem taking them My husband would even be willing to take them apart and put them in the car himself I am disgusted We have now had to cancel our plans to visit Amsterdam
This was shocking customer service at its worstUnbelievable  The customer service was appallingthe car was delivered late to my partners work address and was advisedthat the car would be taken away if we did not pay up The email with the details to pay was issued only 5 minutes before the car arrived at my partners address A horrible experience all round 
Havent received my check yet

I ordered a flower arrangement on Friday It was supposed to arrive on Saturday A representative called me Saturday and told me they could not get it to its destination until Tuesday I told them that was unexceptable The representative said ok we can get it there Monday and we will give it an upgrade I said ok I want balloons and a ton more carnations my friend loves carnations I had ordered the rose and carnation arrangement for her He agreed and the TINY flower arrangement arrived Tuesday with no carnations at all and no balloons I spent 78 and Im completely frustrated with this company I called and complained They agreed I didnt get my upgrade and told me management would call me back  Havent heard from them Dont use this company
no shipping  scam
Ordered shower 211 no delivery no contact Called and promised delivery in around 10 days  still nothing
You told me my review of a watch from Argos had just been published but it hasnt  where is it
We ordered some Canon replacement inks from a website paid by PPal Items arrived Canon compatibles Contacted Seller who insists they did not say Canon genuine so they are right Escalated in Paypal no option to attach supporting documents which we wanted to forward to Paypal So we submit anyway confirmation stated no supporting evidence included
So we searched all over Paypal help google etc how to attach documents for transaction dispute all directs back to same page in resolution centre with NO options given as to how to attach documents to submit
So we called Paypal went through all the 6 number coding password pressing various number options etc until wanting to speak to someone and we have been waiting for nearly THREE 3 hours now listening to that dreadful music repeating over and over still waiting
An honest straight forward attempt to buy printer inks online has turned into a dreadful nightmare by a cowboy website seller and now aided by a faceless non caring corporate entity both shrouding the small inconsequential consumer with red tape and delays with the sole intention to deter any complains
This is the third occasion when I had to use Paypal to resolve claims and though two was successful it always involves so much time and effort that negates any benefit one expects from an online purchase
I do hope someone else comes up with a more transparent honest system service of online payment and downgrade Paypal to obscurity
Lenskart frames are poor quality easily breaks Poor customer service
Wouldnt rate them yet since package STILL has NOT arrived Its way overdue
Very aggravated that my daughters contacts have yet to be mailed
I have been using LensDirect for several years because their prices are hard to beat Determining the actual price however is sometimes a pain They offer free shipping but then supplement that with charges for insurance and handling I work for a company that ships millions of dollars of products every year and the insurance and handling are all part of the shipping costs  we do not separate the two The reason we dont separate them is because it would annoy customers to do so LensDirect doesnt mind annoying their customers
UPDATE Based on LensDirects reply to my review The 2 processing fee on each order offsets a portion of the cost increases related to verification of prescriptions with your eye care provider fuel surcharges on shipping and return processing By charging a percentage they are implying that prescription verification fuel surcharges and return processing costs vary with price So if I buy four boxes of their cheapest contacts it costs them less to verify my prescription than if I buy four boxes of their most expensive contacts Or the cheap contacts incur a lower fuel surcharge than the expensive contacts Or the cheap contacts cost less to process a return than the expensive contacts Based on this ridiculous response I have lowered my review by one star
Had a delivery of a home gym One of the 3 guys there was very rude and threw 45 pound dumbells on our floor as he was removing our old home gym We complained to James at the White Plains store and he said someone would call us back and we received no call back or follow up on the incident We also received no instruction manual or warranty information on the home gym we purchased We had bought a treadmill from them in the past and the guys that had installed the treadmill had stripped the screws when I was moving When i notified them of this they still charged me to have them come out and fix the issue that they had caused I am very dissatisfied and will be taking my business somewhere else in the future
I booked many times with edreams but now I had a very bad experience
I made a reservation but I made a mistake In the web site was written that I could cancel my reservation within 4 hours
No email contact was available
Logging to my edreams there was the reservation but with no indication how to cancel
I tried different phone numbers without success  Firstly i contacted the Italian edreams and after half an hour ttempt and a lot of money spent it is a number at which you are heavily charged they said that they could not cancel because central edreams took the money
I tried your spanish speaking numberno reply and finaly i got your english speaking number I waited a reply for more than half an hour That really to much When I was desparing I got a reply from an operator
Finally i was successfull and I succeeded to speak with the operator who was really very kind and solved my problem but wath a fatigue
So very good service from the operator but very bad service from edream
I will deeply consider if booking by edreams in the future

Ordered birthday cake for my daughter for 16 Feb Realized on 17 Feb that cake was not delivered and sent email request with an update Never received an order but was charged the money Unacceptable
This is a ticket scalping site where you will pay much more than the ticket is worth
I booked 2 tickets and a day later got a call from SchipholTicketsnl that my tickets are not confirmed yet If I still want tickets Ive to pay around 200 Euro extra I wanted my money back they said within 5 days I will get my money back while Ive my flight 2 days later
My friendly msg to all of you Never buy anything from schipholticketsnl otherwise you will badly regret it
Booking reference is SPLC0070897 if anyone want to check it with the company
Cheapoair is asking me to pay 82340 to complete my mothers name in her ticket from Santiago Chile to USA I consider that is an immense amount of money is exactly another ticker And I think the change name is not a huge procedure other then adding to words in my mothers name
The incompetency of the first person who didnt understood very well my mothers name affected the determination of misunderstanding my mothers complete name
Im hoping still that you can help me by completing my mothers name with out any extra charge
The purchase confirmation I received said the concert started at 9pm The ticket only said doors open at 7pm
The concert actually started at 8pm I missed the first hour of the concert because of your error
I will never use Ticket City again and am telling all my contacts about my experience Im so angry with you
They could not unlock my phone and refused to give me a refund stating their failed attempt at unlocking the phone had cost them 40 without stating on their website that this would be the cost of a failed unlock From what I can see sending an email or making a phone call doesnt justify this amount The phone was not stolen but part of a contract with EE I needed to get it unlocked to use abroad I would be very wary of site too It provides no details on where it is based and no contact number
Terrible company that cant handle the large selection they have Placed an order on a game two weeks ago and its still being prepared to ship Talked to customer service and everything they can help is to tell you to submit a ticket Just ridiculous I seriously doubt its a Japanese based company
SEHR SCHLECHT
Called twice to inquire about a large payment increase on my Kohls card I was greeted with rude disrespectful unprofessional CSRs who had no interest in helping but managed to talk down to me and ask What would you like me to do about it I will be paying my card off and will never return to another Kohls store Ive had a card for a long time and never had an issue until now but their extremely low level of customer service is disgusting
Followed eBay instructions ordered the bike and emailed the customer service team to organise click and collect assembled in store Customer service team would not change my request and delivered to my home The courier allowed a random neighbour to sign for the delivery Offered to have store assembled but I had no way of transporting such a large item to their store I had to assemble the bike myself which was challenging as someone not familiar with the process Terrible customer experience
Edit  Thanks for your response All your comments are valid but the only call out I have for you is that your eBay page directs you to contact customer service to update the order for click  collect and also sets the expectation that orders takes 2 business days to leave the warehouse In my case your customer service group also made no attempt to try and contact the couriers and correct the order I would suggest you look at updating your eBay sales pages to make it clear that you require this information to be entered in the order comments
Iv got the pay as you go meters in and the money I put in every week is unbelievable I have asked for the boxes to be removed but use refused to do so
Incorrect product sent plus damage
Nengun customer service reps passed case around were not knowledgeable on product and ultimately decided to wipe their hands of the issue by claiming that the part manufacturer said it would be fine
Multiple images of incorrect parts and production damage supplied but nothing was done to resolve issue
I am now 2400 out of pocket I have used nengun in the past but never again Product was an ORC twin plate clutch If you purchase something from this site and there is an issue with your product you will be stuffed as they take no accountability acting as a middle man between the customer and manufacture
Not impressed with the process I was leased a vehicle with a know damaged left tire on pre trip documents I was assured it was stable however it tore open and had to be changed after two hours of driving Fortunately I was no longer on the freeway where it could have been extremely dangerous if it blew at 110kph I changed the tire and reported the fault and Redspot were going to charge me 550 After arguing this cost when I dropped off the car they waved the fee I was surprised they charged me for the hire at all after that incident I wasnt happy with the experience
I purchased a pair of prescription glasses and it said they had no available stock and it needed to be back ordered I emailed and received an automated response not answering any of my questions and now i feel as though i have been scammed I have also tried calling their number in Wellington but turns out the number cant be dialed and i am unsure as to what is going on
the title explains it all
I ordered from your site a week and a half ago and have not received any info on where my order is I can see you charged my credit card though

Do not order anything from light in the box Total rip off merchants poor quality product and even worse customer service
Ice had PayPal for a few months as it makes it easier to pay for things online I recently set up an Ebay account and linked my PayPal account to it for payments I sold a SatNav on Ebay for 80 the payment worked fine at first and there were no problems About a month later I got an email from PayPal saying the 80 has been taken back out of my account and returned to the customer who bought the SatNav because I didnt sign up for a PayPal account Theres never been a problem with Paypal taking my money to buy things but as soon as I get money put in it it takes it out All PayPal has done to help me is tell me Ill have to contact the buyer myself and work something out between us considering this is someone Ive never met and shes just got a free SatNav I wont be surprised if she just ignores my email Never using PayPal again
1 month  no reception I dont recommand
When you spend 450 on a pair of boots return shipping should be included if you are exchanging the product for a larger size However backcountry gear doesnt care
I have booked a flight to Oslo and a return flight to Amsterdam There was an option to pay an additional 20 or 25 euros for a service package Who thought i would need that service dearly On the return flight checkin luggage was not included No problem i thought i have to book special luggage ski equipment for both flights anyway
I contacted SAS unfortunately they referred me to Travelgenio
I was now at the mercy of Travelgenio who would now make me pay 20 or 25 euro ON TOP OF what SAS and Norwegian would charge me for my special luggage on both flights and for the checkin bagage on the return flight This is a case of hidden costs for an ordinary piece of checkin bagage What do the other passengers do dig a hole and bury their suitcase at Oslo Airport for the return flight
The second complaint is that my travelcompanion Thias see his onestar review below paid 2x30 euro for his special luggage which is the same as mine a stack of skiequipment while i will be EDIT have been charged 2x35 euro excl service package We have the same return flight same airline both booked through Travelgenio and both regret it
The third and biggest complaint is the unbelievable effort it takes to communicate with the Travelgenio helpdesk So many phonecalls so many pending emails After a week of silence I understandably get worried am i waiting for them or are they waiting for me Do i need to contact them in order to get the train going again Have they understood what it is that i want them to do I am sure they have not They will charge me for special luggage and forget to book the ordinary checkin luggage for the return flight because its too much information for them to process in one phone call and it is not mentioned in the emails i receive from them All i need is a simple yes were waiting for NorwegianSAS to answer our email Or no we cannot do anything because you have to pay for the service pack first But all i hear is were so busy we cannot answer you so you have to wait
You are busy 1 because you are confused 2 because you cause confusion and 3 because you dont answer emails which makes the customer send even more emails I myself have worked at a helpdesk for many years and I symphatize with you Love Thomas
UPDATE just removed one star added fourth complaint because Travelgenio requested me to send them all my credit card details PER EMAIL in order to complete the order All arguing was futile they left me no choice or I would have to pay double tariffs for my luggage and skiequipment just before checkin at the airport
The process of ordering is so complicated and manual Also prices were raised and no notice to existing customers was given Thus an order Ive placed many times was suddenly more expensive Overall a worse experience and no longer a good value
We had 1 call to say someone would get back to me  Nothing has happened since
I was not alerted about the price drop protection thing and the ultimate payment amount was increased by AU122 This created a lot of confusion and frustration and I hope l get my money back
Received a cheaper alternative to what I actually ordered When I asked to exchange for what I ordered I was told they were sold out and that my only option was either a refund or an exchange Neither option was what I wanted the item was clearly not sold out when I bought it and if I was sent that in the first place I would have gotten it Very disappointing to not receive something I paid for or to receive an explanation as to how to mix up occurred It felt to me that the item was over sold and that I was given a cheaper alternative in the hopes that I wouldnt notice Very disappointing experience overall
way too hard to get your cash back if you ever have to lodge a claim it takes MONTHS to ever get anything back I like ebates 100x better It is so easy to get your money back and their customer service is amazing with missing cash back It takes so long to get money available from transactions you forget you even did them and then I realized my cash back was randomly declined or just disappeared Too much of a hassle when there are other better cash back sites
Took 3 months to deliver I send emails to check on the status no response When I called I was told they just got the merchandise and they will ship the next Monday Makes me wonder had I not called would I ever get the merchandise at all
Agent John Chang did not verify my address so shipment was sent back
Originally he had difficulty finding an old account then figured
the amount wrong  I had to send additional money to finalize this
order When market moved he suggested increasing the amount to
5 over original Then market moved down  I still do not have this
order It has been nearly 3 weeks since my original contact with
Monex Extremely disappointed
Brought a I pad form Groupon and turned out it had a password lock on it and I cant use it contacted Groupon about it I didnt want a refund nor did I want them to take it back I simple want to know how to get that lock off and they after a week and a half sent me a bogus email trying to clearly remove themselves from the problem instead of trying to help me
 dont like glasses its too narrow and its not the same as on picture too narrow please help me give me my money back
I used aoin a hurry as my great Hotpoint Minstral fridge freezer suddenly lost its door from its hinges
and I had to replace very quickly to save the frozen goodsAo offered a very quick serviceand the new fridge came the following day This new Hotpoint Aquarius was a major desaster It was so noisy that a friend sitting in the lounge thought he had heard an aeroplaneThe icebox was a bizarre design
which did not make ice as the water kept flowing out of itbuilding up an iceberg on the rack but no ice to use I disliked the fridge from day one but between aoand Hotpoint it took four months of
correspondencetelephone calls and aggro to return Aos telephone system is set up in a way
that it puts you through to the manufacturer immediately
Hotpoint refers you back immediately to aoboth parties washing their hands of the problem
Whilst these companies play ball with the customer you start running out of time and getting very frustrated Hotpoint keeps sending engineers in spite of you explaining that it is the de sign you are
objecting to not an engineering issue You waste four full days waiting in for four engineers when you do not even want one In the end I resolved my problem through the Resolve your claim website
and was able to replace the Hotpoint by this wonderful Samsung which works like a dream
It is very well and intelligently designed space is used to its best advantage quiet lovely
to look at works efficiently Ao on the phone was very helpful when it came to finally change the fridges but the delivery was another disaster I had two builders in my kitchen when the
fridge freezer came and they could not believe the rudeness They plonked the huge freezer in the middle of the kitchen and refused to remove the packaging I am a person in my late seventies
and could not have coped with the packaging without my builders There was no question with
helping to install the fridge Finally I am de lighted to have this Samsung but would never again
buy an appliance on the internetSorry this was a bad experience which I could not recommend to a friend
Service good but charged for a cable I said I did not want I am not happy about that In fact he tried to sell all sorts of things and I said I wasnt buying anything elseAnd then he changed us anyway I had a cable there already
Would never use this site again They could not even get my order straight
I paid for 23 day delivery and have been waiting for a week
Seems to me the most important information to provide a customer is the purchase confirmation and shipping status of the customers order Ive placed two orders for nearly 2K each In both cases I never received any email from starfiredirect with a confirmation of my order shipping status tracking numbers or anything of the sort Theres an overly complicated customer portal that Im asked to log into which is a hassle It contains tons of not very useful information and features but no shipping status or tracking information I dont need a dashboard which they provide in their customer portal I just want to know where the stuff is that I ordered  did it ship and if so tracking info Keep it simple
These alleged cuts are better described as scraps that you might find underneath a cutter at the end of the day None of this meat looks or taste like pork loin The meat varies in color from Pink to reddish brown Most of it looks and taste like ham or Canadian bacon that is on the older side of still being fresh Im glad I didnt pay full price for this or I would really feel jipped

I travel a lot with my job and like to have access to decent food while away from home This week there was a schedule change at work So I tried to go online and have my box shipped to the state in which I am traveling  Customer service gave me several bogus excuses such as I put the wrong address Then they said its too late because the package had shipped already however my delivery isnt schedule until Tuesday the 7th Make a long story short Joe stated they would still deliver the box to my home address regardless of the fact no one will be there and payment had been charged to my credit and there was nothing I could do He completely talked over me and stated again they had already been paid
I requested for a ride around 1050pm on Tuesday 3072017  nobody showed up to pick me  after about 10min time  Lyft debted my account with 797 claiming that one driver Mr Jorge picked me up meanwhile the mr Jorge never showed up to pick me  I complained to lyft  yet they refused to return my money back maybe because they have information of my account so they feel they can charge money from my account so easy PLEASE LYFT RETURN MY MONEY BACK
The first person was the best he was so helpful what a shame about the two others we had help us  With enquirers after

I had placed an order over a year ago with fabletics and never received a shipment confirmation I called about 3 weeks after placing the original order and they said they were out of the one item I wanted and to choose a new one so I did and payed the difference The same thing happened again never received shipping notification I called back and asked what the issue was and they said I had to choose another item as they were out of the one I wanted again fed up with the whole process I asked for my VIP membership and my order to be cancelled and all of my money back It is just now 1 year later that they gave me a gift card with my money back Hopefully I actually get my order this time
I have called for assistance 3 times over the last week for help Left my email telephone number order number and date of purchase and have not had a word from Game Cheap until this request for my opinion arrived in my mail box You can imagine my interest in your company and products I shall be contacting my bank tomorrow to start proceedings for a refund It has been a week since my order was downloaded and Ive not been able to load it and use it
It started out very well they foundl me a spot for storage two weeks later they called that They forgot to do some paperwork had to go back not very happy with that it was a good 45 minutes away so I decided to go a little early so we could take care of the paperwork the guy shows up sees me goes into the office and locks the door would it really kill a person to open up 5 minutes earlier I should have left and not even help them out with the paperwork that they messed up not a happy customer
Made a purchase on ebay for item in Euros  UK pound exchange rate was 117 euro to the pound this rate used by all recognized governments and financial institutions throughout the world   Paypal uses a different rate of 113 euro to the pound to increase their coffers  Wow paypal joins the likes of Starbucks  Google  Amazon etc etc all american etc etc 
Like Scott I was surprised when I found out that I had only bought a 3 month subscription Plus the upsell offers were annoying I dont appreciate the hoodwink
I WAS TRYING TO SELECT AN ADDRESS FOR CROATIA AND THE SECTION WHERE IT SAYS PROVIDENCE STATE CITY WAS NOT LISTED AND I COULD NOT MOVE ON FROM THERE UNLESS I SELECTED SOMETHING IM NOW CONCERNED THAT THE SUPPLIER MIGHT SEND TO THE WRONG PLACE AND I MIGHT LOSE MONEY
Selecting merchandise was easy and effortless but checking out was a pain in the butt I wanted to enter the Visa checkout program but repeatedly got an error message telling me that there was an error with my information I was not given an error code or any other details and when I rechecked my data each time everything was correct I had to enter the exact same data 6 times and finally I skipped the Visa part of the checkout and proceeded directly to regular checkout It worked fine but I still have no idea how to check out with the Visa option Further it was unclear how to become a VIP member There are no directions and no sign up specifics I believe you automatically get enrolled but I have no idea This site has nice clothing  Ill have to see the items when I get them to see the quality  but the specifics of the transactions are HORRIBLE There are no details or no explanations as to how to deal with anything required I am now in a horrible mood having had to wrestle with this site Had I not been purchasing a gift I would have just given up and stopped dealing with this site
Selected styles out of stock or back ordered had to reorder several times delaying delivery as well
will never buy here again
I purchased a battery from a company with an Australia web site and a NSW address I had to wait two weeks for delivery as it is shipped from China The battery was not the correct one for the Kindle Fire which is what I had ordered To contact the company I had to find the ABN and contact that way I emailed them they informed me I must send the battery back to China I replied no I purchased from AU company and I mailed the battery to the address from ABN
A month later no refund I emailed the company No reply As the payment was thru paypal I contacted paypal to dispute First person made me repeat info I gave to auto attendant then go thru the story She then transferred me Second person made me repeat my info then go thru the story He told me he would file dispute notify battery company and 10 days to have them respond He also asked re tracking no of return I informed him that battery company did not tell me to obtain tracking no and I did not wish to pay extra to return the item
Several hours later I get an email from paypal demanding I provide information about dispute including tracking no I email a reply for the 3rd time providing the explanation
This morning I have an email from paypal demanding that I go to their website and provide details re dispute including tracking no If I fail to do so the dispute will be dismissed
The obvious paypal strategy is to wear people down By demanding repeating explanation of details and wasting my time they plan to make me give up No doubt it is effective for a percentage of disputes
This is wrong I will never use paypal again
absolutely terrible and basically none existent customer service i received a faulty item which cost me alot of money i sent banggood video evidence of the problem and numerous emails explaining the situation only to be replied by script and to be told i would receive a message again and again it has been several months since i received the faulty item and i have not been offered any help or refund
a friend of mine has had the same thing happen to him so this is not a one off this company has no respect for its customers and uses its distant location as a means of believing they do not need to comply with standardized regulations or have the common decency to respond to their customers
When we confirmed our tickets and paid we were supposed to get a confirmation email We did not We have called two times to ask for it to be sent Talked to Mark and Stacy they both said they sent it while we were on the phone we said it never came thru They blamed it on our email address Today we have gotten at least 10 emails today We do not know if we have been ripped off or not I would be very skeptical of Flight Hub if I were you
My goods were taken by a courier mistakenly from the pack n send warehouse where i was supposed to pic up as the delivery point
When the parcel was picked up the equipment suffered internal damage
They fail to tell you each link you pay more for shipping than the product and even ordering several items from same vendor they charge per item to ship Im so disappointed and cant cancel items

Ordered so called Hardback book as it was advertised Instead I received used loose leaf pages and paid over 140 for it Even though advertised as hardback they offered to refund but unfortunately needed book for college within a week or so and was afraid the replacement which was hardback and a lot more expensive would not be back on time I could have easily bought the used loose leaf pages for less than half the price was definitely NOT as advertised So  if you are ordering hardback better make sure to have them check their stock before they send you something you dont want Offering a refund for false advertising is not acceptable was my first and last purchase from Biblio

Traded my car in they owed me 5820 pounds  promised me the money would be in my account on Monday afternoon No money on Monday  started phone calls trying to find somebody to help me Was Tuesday morning before I finally got somebody to assist me  then I had to go back to the shop to finish it  told them I would be taking legal advice  wanted my car back before they finally paid me Incompetent idiots 
I was told that if I rented with you that my space would be prorated if I needed to leave early THEN I was told after moving in that THAT WAS NOT your policy Pretty sad
My package was never delivered Their supposed customer service person refused to give me a refund and said there was nothing they could do to find the package
Very little was available in my size All the patterns I would have picked were out of stock
Sent an incomplete order and after I received it they could not complete the order Should have told me they could not have sent a complete order before shipping
I was trying to find an apartment in Milan so I did my booking request Spot a home assigned me their agent
After several days of searching we finally found a very good offer so I said to this guy to go ahead with the request From that on everything went wrong
1 The landlady couldnt met one of our petitions so she told him that she agreed to have us and the decision was on us so he called us Then he said that he was calling me the next morning in order to confirm if we wanted to take the place or not however he didnt call me at all
2 After several hours I decided to call to spot a home and ask for him just to find this guy wasnt at the office and didt even go to work that day
3 There was another person saying me she was going take control of my process since my assigned agent didnt work that day She said she was sending an email to me within 15 minutes with the confirmation and the landlady contact details but after 3 hours she hadnt sent me anything
4 I decided to call again just to have to speak with a totally different person which didnt even know about my process what shows that there was not records of what was happening thus I had to explain everything again from scratch
5 After another 3 hours a FOURTH NEW PERSON sent me an email in behalf of my assigned agent saying that the landlady had already rented the apartment to another person probably because she was tired of waiting a call from this agency that came too late
6 This new agent offered me a different option not only 200 euros more expensive but also A PROPERTY I HAD ALREADY DISCARDED IN MY PREVIOUS PROCESS which proves the lack of basic communication and professionalism of this company
Avoid these crooks like the plague

I have used this site before with no problems After todays experience I will now have to give this company 1 star One set of the lenses were not in stock I requested that they simply ship what they had in stock and refund me what they did not currently have 2 messages later and a phone call from them my simple instructions were still not carried out They kept explaining that they will order it and ship it to me in 810 days On the phone i actually canceled my whole order and even agreed to pay the 10 restocking fee for a product they didnt have 1H later my order was processed and shipped I then received another email stating that the items were already shipped It is truly amazing how fast it happened after the employee said he could cancel the order I was again being asked if i could wait for the lenses not in stock

I bought Christmas gictz about six weeks before Christmas and not one salesperson mentioned this to me and my receipts did not reflect this upcoming change in policy I found out several weeks ago when I tried to take some purchases back As you can tell Im still upset about it Kohls wouldnt even give me store credit They have now lost a lifetime monthly customer I will choose a store with the standard 90 day return policy No wonder Kohls is doing so poorly in the market and closing so many stores
I placed an order and it has been over two week and no one can tell me where my items are
I bought 3 tickets for a total of 218891 EUR and got a confirmation email that payment was received and all is OK
After 5 hours I get an email from them that my tickets have been cancelled and if I want my money back I must send them a copy of my ID passport photos of both sides of my credit card and only then they will send my money back
I buy tickets almost monthly and first time with them as skyscanner recommended them BUT NEVER I WILL DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY
Now I have to book my tickets again go to my bank and report this TIXFR fraudulent merchant and wait god knows how long to seem my 2000 euros back
You will have to remortgage if you wish to return the item
I ordered flowers for my MIL birthday yesterday for delivery today I paid with a 30 gift card I bought on groupon plus an additional 22 on my charge The problems started with an email saying the florist was unable to process the order It left me with the option to Send a nice surprise bouquet or a florist choice bouquet Neither of which had a picture or description I paid for a bouquet with roses I wanted roses in it not a florist choice for daisies Called Teleflora and they told me the florist didnt have some of the flowers I told them it was fine to substitute colors and flowers but they needed to assure that there were roses in it since that is what I paid for I then googled and was able to find the Telaflora florist in my MILs small town Called her directly she told me she had all the flowers needed for the order as it was pictured but couldnt process it because Teleflora was offering her 25 for the order including delivery and she couldnt do it for that amount of money I told her this was between them and that I as the customer shouldnt be fighting this battle She assured me that she would contact them She contacted them they agreed to the price that she needed but never sent the paperwork She made the arrangement on their verbal agreement and waited Several hours later thinking everything was taken care of I got another call from Teleflora telling me we have to substitute for cheaper flowers or pay 20 more It took me over an hour of them telling me that the florist didnt have the flowers and to substitute and me calling the florist directly while on my landline with telaflora and playing a game of he said she said One of them was clearly lying After an hour Teleflora paid the florist the money needed for the original order I placed and the florist sent out the order as pictured on the Teleflora website Upon reading other complaints this seems to be an ongoing problem with Teleflora
ordered ink cartridges for a inkjet HP 8600 received cartridges for who knows what tried to send a email three different times didnt get any response
Called to drive through and I was last car in queue Was told system had failed and I have to come in store Explained I was physically disabled and was told  Sorry theres nothing I can do about it  Which is odd because if I were sat in grill order parking you would have to fetch it to me I will never set foot in your establishment again
I ordered flowers to be delivered for a very important ocassion last week They were ordered intime for delivery Friday I was notified late Friday thatbthey would not be delivered until Saturday As this was a business address of coursevthe flowers could not be delivered until Monday I alerted the company by email This didntnhelp The flowers landed on Monday having very obviouly been in transit for the weekend Imsent complaints to both the courier and Prestige flowers and although I have had acknowledgments I still have not received an apology or a response I am disgusted No wonder Interflora has this market captured
There is no advantage to using this Company or any other travel agency for that matter
They claim to have the lowest price or to match They do not
If you use them then If there is a problem or change you have just added a more restrictive layer in fixing the problem And more than likely they will want to charge you for the privelege
With a great deal of patience you might be able to get them to help But be prepared to fight their often circular reasoning
So basically they provide no added service or value and they only complicate potential resolutions
I placed my order and received a shipping notification 17 days ago Im still waiting to receive my pool Ive received zero shipping updates and I have no idea where my order is You would think it would be difficult to misplace an 18x52 pool
Over charged for my order called immediately but no refund was put in process but they put through the wrong charge faster than any thing I have seen 45 minutes on the phone with customer service today looking for a refund as well as the arrangement that was supposed to be delivered 24 hours ago Amy a supposed supervisor tells me that the refund was not put into process because visitation wasnt scheduled until today at the funeral home Never give this company your business I wish there was a way to give them negative stars I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau
The ring vibrator would not work 
Not impressed three of my vinyls came warped and skipped they wanted me to pay shipping to return and if refunded I would only get what I paid for it no shipping refund I was not OK with that because I bought it with the expectation that it was  playable

I ordered a laptop battery but received the wrong one I tried to call 24se but their phone assistance is available randomly on that day for example it was simply closed I sent them an email explaining the issue and received a reply next day to send the package back with the supplied return number I did as instructed after a week nothing happened so I called again and the guy said it usually takes a week for them to process return requests and claimed that they would send it during that week didnt happen Two weeks after Ive sent the package back I called again and it turns out that they simply did not have the model I ordered and that I would have to wait until April 7 Given that my work is computerbased waiting for a battery for 2 months is unacceptable I wonder why the costumer service did not tell me immediately about this issue Very unprofessional
to booking is easy have a detail of room to be a decision
Game has taken 14 days to arrive its literally a skinny plastic box with a disk inside Absolutely incompetent and lazy Would rather eat a pile of snake st than buy something from this again Dont touch this thing with a 100 foot pole buy your game somewhere else
I wrote a review and Trustpilot blocked it because the firm asked them to ask me the data of my order
Then I reluctantly sent them a screenshot of the email from the seller but the review never appeared again
Its evident that TrustPilot is too complicated or who knows they must be biased against the customers
As to my experience this site is just a waste of time unless you are a really angry customer who is ready to fight against Trustpilot AND the firm in order to make your simple review appear
I mean why bother I spent too much time on this already

I purchased bed  mattress and box spring on 342017 and got it delivered on 352017 The overall height of the bed is too high after the assembly and it is uncomfortable to sit on top it I complained on Auburn Hills office on 362017 and the representative told me to exchange box spring with a low height one would cost me 200 full price

It was Valentines Day its was plainly being delivered to a company office and not a home address I ordered well in advance and yet it did not get there till 547 By which time my partner add left and it was only by chance that there was anyone there to receive it They must of realise that there was more than a good chance that most people and company offices close at 530pm I did not know till DX emailed me no the day that it may not get there till 6  I email them and got know response I ordered them early so they  you would have plenty off time to get there at a reasonable time I can not see why as it was Valentines Day and they new it was flowers that this is to much to ask and why this did not happen It completely ruined the hole point of getting them delivered to her place of work and then to add insult to injury the flowers look nothing like as good as they do in your photograph the Lilys did not even open till the roses were almost dead Leaving my hole experience of your company a complete and utter let down
I have been putting of make my review till now as to give you ample time to put things right through my many Emails only to be fobbed off time and time again Leaving me know choice but to write this review
There for it is in the strongest possible terms that I recommend that anyone thinking of using this company to send a loved one or anyone else for that matter flowers not to to avoid complete and utter disappointment
The flowers I ordered were simply substandard
Regards Chris slack
Website claims book by 9pm for next day delivery I booked by 6pm and the flowers arrived at lunchtime the day after the next day Surprise anniversary flowers no longer a surprise Left query via website and got response that I should have read small print on website where the claims for next day delivery are heavily caveated with no responsibility held by Prestige Flowers for late delivery
So you pay your money and take a huge chance if you want a specific day for delivery Beware people
PURTROPPO HANNO UN CORIERE NON AFFIDABILE
When I ordered my vanity on a Wed it did not get shipped until the following Monday because apparently there were computer issues When I received my vanity on the following Wed it was damaged and had to be sent back Currently waiting on a new one while my contractor gets paid for nothing disappointed as the freight carrier states they did not damage it Had to give at least one star would have given no stars
We booked a car with cartrawler and paid for hire cost and insurance immediately On arrival at Alicante airport Centauro said the insurance was only for the passengers and NOT the car  we would need to take further insurance so they charged us again for insurance and car hire Car trawler say they cannot be responsible for conversations at the airport 
Tennis shoes were ordered and paid for  27 Jan after 3 weeks no sign of the shoes Nobody seemed to know where they were Called them and finally heard that they werent available anymore Which is strange since Smashinn is still advertising heavily for the same shoe on Google And you can still pay them directly
Hope to get my money back now which they confirmed But to me this feels pretty weird
I got the wrong colored ink it said 57 and it didnt work cause I noticed after I put the ink cartridge in it was a way different number the black was perfect but now my lines are plugged and I cant print anything

Be prepared to be charged twice Rentalcarscom will overcharge you the full cost of your rental for doing nothing but passing your booking request onto the hire company Youll have to pay again at your destination
Never rent with Rental Cars
They are an inefficient lying and scam company
They do not fulfill the reserved thing they do not answer the phone they do not take care of their mistakes They are not interested in the customer they are inefficient and rude
NEVER RENTAL CARS
I have had the worst experience ever with this company I booked a room to possibly go and see a friend quite far from myself was not sure if I was going to be able to attend so I made sure when booking a room I selected one with free cancellations as to not lose money if I couldnt make it after cancelling the room I have been informed that property does not offer free cancellation and I have been charged the full amount
After informing bookingcom that the room I selected was not the room I was given and there had been an error on there part meaning the room on show that I booked was never actually offered by the hotel and it had always been full fee charged if cancelled they are not willing to refund my money
For such a large company to not have the technical ability to resolve this by investigating what could have gone wrong with this booking causing the room I selected and specifically needed to apparently have never been on offer is outrageous I feel
I will never be using bookingcom again or the property in question but due to trustpilots terms of service I cannot mention there name in this review
Avoid this company at all costs you will have problems and wont get any help in resolving them just more head aches
I have had a site with webnode for two years Every time I have a question abut something they are unable to answer it Other web site builders are mucj easier to use stay away from this one
My personally feeling is that I have been a loyal customer and spent thousands on ssensecom What I got from them is their rude services Their choice of shipping company with UPS is bad UPS never delievered my package and by the end they returned to the shipper without even noticing me When I emailed my complaints the customer service just chose to ignore you always Not a trust whorthy company As I live in Montreal I paid a several visits to they store the staffs there are just ignoring you Yes they like watching you without even saying hello to you just watching you till you get out of the store Yes they have variety of products but if you want to experience some high qualified service I will never recommend this site to you
QUALITY OF BAKED CAKESUPERIOR Also PACKAGING great
However if you blinked you missed the size of the cake Accurate measurements should be labeled
Had some damage to Car was told there would be trouble and I would lose my No Claims Bonus even thought I had Paid to protect it
I just placed an order and then scheduled my install According to the scheduler the person who took my order had EVERYTHING WRONG
I am now on the phone with a new person trying to fix it
Purchased a few items from them had a couple to return because they didnt look the part and sizing was off which made me question their authenticity
Exhausted all contact forms  phone emailed and Whattsapp  for more than a week and never got a word from them about return procedures or refund
Finally gave up contacted Paypal and opened a claim they were the ones that refunded me via their buyer protection
This company should be ASHAMED Price RIDICULOUS Arrangement SUCKED My husband is so upset because this was a birthday surprise for me at my office Customer service is a literal JOKE 40 minutes of trying to get though to people for whom English is not their first language They wanted to CHARGE Michael an extra 40 to replace the arrangement I originally received which I thought he had maybe paid around 25 for since I knew he had already gotten me another gift but he knows I love flowers On top of that they signed the card MICK  good thing we are happily married can you imagine getting a delivery of flowers from some other man He was assured on the phone by the sales person A large beautiful bouquet of roses etcHAH I got daisies in a Dollar Store tea cup with three tiny tea roses and one carnation I felt so bad when I got home His face just fell when he saw what he had paid 6700I think what made me the most upset aside from him feeling so dissappointed in what was supposed to be a lovely gift was the fact that there was a 1395 delivery charge and the florist that did the arrangement is literally 10 feet from the front door of my office I could have met them in the parking lot in the back office as I park my car facing their back driveway where their delivery vehicle is parked every morning not the florists fault they are told what to arrange so now they are supposed to come pick up the old arrangement and replace with a proper bouquet well Im on a three day weekend for my birthday This is why I ALWAYS use local florists directly these services are a rip off I worked for a greenhouse many years ago in accounting I know how much all this stuff costs and this company is a sordid tawdry moneygrubber taking advantage of people trying to do something nice for people they love Im simply appalled

Its been over 2 weeks and I still havent received my 100 rebate called customers service and spoke with Gary she was VERY RUDE and condescending Talk about making someone feel worse than they already driving around with this device She wouldnt let me speak and when I asked questions her answers were curt and not helpful I had to leave a message for her supervisor  I didnt get the help I was looking for

Really Really bad customer service Im in a state of panick regarding my order as I will be going away soon and no one will reply to my emails or messages on Facebook All I wanted was information and some reassurance
I will probably not buy again from TomTop despite the amazing prices
I booked our flight and hotel for a 21 day trip not even 24hrs later the price drops 300 So I call customer service the gentleman that answers is totally rude from the jump Then he flat out says there is no price gaurantee on Bookit and if you cancel there is no refund An hour later I receive an email mind you there is a time difference of 5 hours that my flights are refundable if I call back by 8 pm I call and guess what Bookit customer service is closed This is the first company that doesnt have a price guarantee and we will not be using their services again I will stick with Travelocity
Dish could care less of what their clients concerns are
I have had the worst ever experience with Strawberrynetcom My order number Order No 1720122595 was so shabbily treated I paid up the full amount via my visa card only to be asked for the account statement from the credit card company When i provided that I was asked for a utility service bill in order to establish my credentials all over again The credit card statement comes to my office and the utility bill asked for had my residential address of course I have been told that they cant process my order DESPITE THE FACT THAT MY CARD HAS BEEN DEBITED FOR THE FULL AMOUNT
I am told by this esteemed company that my money will be refunded in 7 working daysam still waiting
I buy extensively online from all over the world and also pay for a lot of services such as travel etc But this is the first time that I have had this horrifying experience with an online portal ITS THE WORST EVER SITE AND WOULD ADVISE EVERYONE TO STAY AWAY FROM IT
I bought 5 soccer tickets worldcup match JAPANTHAILAND which is on 28 march
But That tickets havent arrived yet
I try to send themticketbisemail but no one reply
I purchased 2 boxes of aqua oasis contacts should be changed every 15 days they are braking every 34 days so I have to change them Im almost out of stock for about a month
I bought a Swiss air ticket for the first time on this website The price was slightly lower than than on Swiss Air so I decided to save the extra bit and go with this agency I use all sorts of online agencies for years and never had an issue
Ticket was easy to buy got my booking confirmation after purchase so far so good Then I proceeded to log in to my Swiss Air miles account so I could add the booking to collect miles add my seats etc
This is where I encountered a problem the ticket I bought was a no luggage ticket I have one piece of Luggage and am not flying a low cost airline also the ticket price was high I went back to see the fares on their site and did not see anywhere pre purchase the option to add luggage etc
I called them straight away but was on hold for over 20 min so I had to hang up as this was in the evening So I decided to write them an email with the situation They emailed back a couple of hours later saying that I had to call Swiss air to add luggage and pay extra But no sorry or lets see if we can help you maybe refund you and re buy the proper ticket or something
So I decided to call again the numbers provided on the email One number I called 4 times and there was never any answer and the other one which is the number to speak to agents who can change the ticket kept going to answering service
Then I found the number for the sales department and they told me that they could not help me that I had to call the same numbers as above So basically nobody is dealing with the situation that should have never happened in the first place
If you go on Swiss Air it gives you the options to buy the fares for hand luggage luggage and fully flexible even when you click one it asks you again before you purchase ticket They do not have this here so was misleading including the fare which was almost the same as buying it on Swiss Air with luggage
I asked the sales department to pass me to a manager who could maybe help to fix the situation and keep me as a client Of course the Manager was busy am still waiting to hear from someone
The service has always been excellent
They took 1 euro from my balance without my consent few days ago While contacting support they told me that it is due to currency changes lol as if they dont know the currency rates of the day when they charge you
Price variable of the same product when shipped to different countries especially to Asia is a big turn down Not even sure if this is legal to sell adjusted prices to different countries There are other websites with better pricing system and lower mark up
Chatting on line works for some but not me Id rather speak to a Customer Service Rep
Ordered set of shocks for my car Discription stated these would fit my year and make They werent even close But that would not bother me Its that I have to pay shipping to return them then pay shipping to reorder
I will never order from this site again or recommend this site
The charging station that came with the product I purchased and just received is poorly designed The contact points on the charging base dont connect to the products contact point so it wont charge properly
Message to Banggood WHEN YOU REPLY TO THIS REVIEW MAKE SURE THE FOLLOWING PAGES DONT SHOW IN STOCK OR YOURE MAKING TOTAL FOOLS OUT OF YOURSELVES BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU DONT HAVE IT IN STOCK

Pros
The products I received and tested were ok and very cheap
Cons
A number of In stock Banggood products are not in stock and never will be
Banggood deceives its customers by putting products on its website it knows it will never be able to deliver For example the Arduino GSM shield I ordered 3 weeks after my order they send me a mail to say its out of stock When I went to the product page it said that the product was in stock So I told the customer care on the other side that it shows that its still in stock but she didnt respond to my remark and said it was out of stock and always asked if I wanted a refund After 4 days of emailing back and forth with screenshots and telling them that they should remove the in stock from their website or send me the product they told me they would send the products and asked me to give them good reviews 2 weeks later not really unexpected I got an email that my order was cancelled and I would get a refund Banggood is deceiving its clients
Instead of 1 package everything seperate
I created my order in December 2016 which was a selection of different products Despite the appearance Banggood is an in between party that will collect orders and dispatch it to different Chinese companies Although I dont have a problem with this concept they should at least offer the possibility to send everything in one package Banggood doesnt allow that so I received 6 different packages all at different dates Since I work during the day I had to go to the post office 6 different time instead of once What a waste of time
Long delivery time
It took about 6 weeks to receive all my products which is a long time
The website clearly states that a round trip ticket to DFW from MSP was 256 including taxes and fees I jumped on the ticket Excited about the price and missing the very last spot where it stated what the actual charge was 338 Nearly 80 more than the advertised price Very dissatisfied with this creative marketing and pricing I will not use this site again unless there is some action taken to rectify this sneaky charge Furthermore I will make sure that I let everyone whom I speak to regarding travel know about your fine print scheme to lure you in for a great deal Not a fan
My other half booked a surprise birthday trip with Lastminutecom to go to Barcelona this weekend Our flight from London was meant to be early Friday morning so we have two full days away Due the a flight reschedule our new flight from London was Friday evening This means we have paid nearly 500 to have one day in Barcelona to then fly back Sunday lunchtime After 12 phone calls in the last week we are still waiting for a manager to call back We are willing to fly earlier than the original booking or fly back on Monday We have been completely flexible but as of yet we have had no response from anybody Be warnedif they tell you they will respond in 34 hours they will not You are always waiting 34 hours which actually means days Feeling incredibly let down by this company We have now lost money and a birthday is completely ruined I dont expect any help from them and will never use them again

As usual with Harvey Norman more bull crap  I ordered online this time as the staff in the Tralee shop can be abrasive and rude in some departments there to my surprise after a few days I rang and queried about my order to be told that they would get someone from the Tralee shop to contact me then to be told they over sold them by the way not a first for them but yet still took money when i ordered online and to be honest gave me some bullcrap excuse about some other box as if i cared i was ringing about my order not anything else but was nice of him to think i did give a st sarcasm in case you dont know I knew there was a reason i stayed from them customer service is one of the worst i have ever come across save yourself head ache and go some where else
Advertised delivery times 10  20 working days
Reality 50  working days with customer service every time responding to an inquiry that delivery could be delayed with another 12 weeks
Of course this is unacceptable for products that are supposed to protect your smartphone as this means you go 25 months without protective covers
I got the game in good time but the setup required to preorder was incredibly broken First of all I couldnt set up an account with ShopTo using the intended email address And then when I tried to use an alternative email I found it had set up with the original email without any notification to say so
When I finally got access to this acccount and preordered the game it ended up doing so twice This is really frustrating when you get charged before dispatch and cant get a full refund without phoning Luckily my brother wanted a copy but I will be very hesitant to preorder again without certainty that the interface wont break and give me an unwanted outcome
The product descriptions are misleading and there was no reply to my email
I hate this website so much They give you 5 days a month to skip and if you dont skip in that period youre charged for another month Its impossible to cancel You have to wait for a representative to chat with and even then they get snarky  god forbid you forget about the chat for 30 seconds while you wait to be attended to They will leave you If that isnt enough the clothes are not that great Do not start a membership with them unless you have an hour every month to chat with someone about skipping or youd like to take the better part of a day to cancel something you dont use
I wished I have read the reviews I have returned the car on 15th of January Have paid the 950 euros deposit and 37  days past no sign for it I have called at least 5 times to them and 2 or 3 times to Do you Spain I have asked for the link for full terms and conditions from dickmanns but have never received it And there are no terms and conditions on their website too
Worst Company Ever also claiming the issue with the accounts which is ridiculous
They are holding my deposit and I am paying interest on top of it 
Will be contacting trade standards through our in house lawyer 
Avoid 
They took an order and took the money then said it wasnt in stock Instead of refunding the money they took another payment I now have to wait another 10 days to get my money back for both payments
I have also had to contact my credit card company to let them know that they took the second payment without permission
I have sent an email in and have heard nothing back from them not even an apology I would think twice before giving these guys your credit card details
I called them before I ordered the glasses to make sure they were in stock because I was ordering a few different colors of the same frame I was told that one of the colors was in stock the others would be back ordered 12 weeks No problem I put the order in The first pair shows up great Then I get an email saying that the other colors are backordered and they wont be in for 34 weeks So I call to see if I can move the return time I have for the first pair until I get the other colors but the customer service person tells me that all the other colors are discontinued and I will never be receiving them side note they are not discontinued the manufacturer has them on their website so maybe their supplier cant get them dont know but when I bring this up the customer service person reccomends that I buy them on the manufactuers site which I will be doing So just to recap I do my due dillegence and this is what I got
12 weeks
34 weeks
Discontinued
Personally Im okay that they are discontinued but its the way this went down Had I not called to ask about the return policy I never wouldve found out they were discontinued and I wouldve just waited around AND if they had told me the first time the other colors werent available I never wouldve ordered any of the glasses especially the one pair that Im now on the hook to pay to return
Im sure Im the outlier here I can see that they have lots of great reviews but this is bad customer service
Again we ordered coins buy 3 get 1 free and again  2nd order they didnt get it right Not happy 
They have lost my package which contains an IPhone Tracking specialist has been assigned to the case but there is no KPI in terms of number of days to come back to you Still unresolved
If KPI or target is not set for the staff what is the action taken to ensure Customer focused vision is there promoted in their website
Money gone package gone time wasted unlimited of follow ups
Item bought from their eBay shop It did not arrive so now I am out of pocket as I dont seem to be able to get through to them tat it didnt arrive  the only response from gameseek is for them to keep sending me the tracking information which doesnt change the fact I DID NOT RECEIVE THE ITEM I would not recommend them at all
Couldnt do enough to make sure that everything was to your requirement
When i first signed up it worked well I was prevetted for two young people that i pay university school fees for in Kenya I gave names when i first met them I see them every year to check on progress and so forth
Now one month into it I send money over and i am cancelled for every other transaction within two minutes of first being approved
Now i am talking very small amounts of money here maybe 1500025000 per month I do not take a chance and I do bank wires for the larger amounts needed for the beginning of the school terms Even though that costs me 3500 and a much lower exchange rate If they denied a measly 17500 i know they will not approve 90000
There are ALWAYS emergencies popping up with young college kids so sometimes it does not just fit into sending money once per month

Ink farm replacement inks clogged my Canon Pixpa almost immediately Never happened when I used Canon inks over the past 10 years So I bought Canon ink again to replace and as soon as I installed it it worked fine again
I was charged for a subscription without warning Since there was no new information forthcoming more than I had already provided I cancelled it online At the same time the site offered upgraded services on a recurring fee schedule
The help link leads you to an FAQ page with no way to communicate directly with a person To be fair I could not give them a 1 star as there wasnt an opportunity to be rude
I am also waiting for my results The site should have warned about the wait time to manage expectations and not find out about the delay at the members log in site You have had to pay for a kit to get here
If you want prompt results or plan on giving this as a present dont buy the service or any membership subscription
Very very poor directions of assembly guide
I purchased a pair of Suicoke I ordered a pair of IT 40 of what i assumed was a womens sizing as it was advertised in the womens shoe section The size chart didnt work after much research all reputable sights stated that IT 40 was the same as an EU 40 When the shoes arrived they were a size EU 41 mens After some emailing ssense refused to take any responsibility for the fact that their web sight had inadequate information about the sizing of suicoke no where did it state that the sizing was male and the fact that they sent me a different size to what i ordered They did not offer any recompense on postage or extend anything other than their basic return policy I will no longer do business with them This was my first interaction with ssense and i will not recommend them
Order wrong 12 order right installation date incorrect
I placed a car ad which ran for a week before it got pulled out by Gumtree just as I received 2 offers I asked for the reason but was refused an answer other then they suspected my ad was fraudulent based on the photo I used and my account automatically frozen After a week of daily emails between myself and the support team during which time they refused to give me either the contact details of their supervisor or a phone number so I could call Gumtree and complain directly they finally agreed to put the ad back on and sent an apology for the frustration caused By then the prospective buyers were gone and the only other response for a whole week was from a scammer wanting to be contacted back I tried to edit the ad and lower the price but at this time I was again blocked from posting an ad and when I tried emailing support my email was returned from host dataebaycom 21611317268 reason 554dataebaycom 554 BLACKLIST
Pity that eBay took over Gumtree because it used to be a decent site before that but ever since they took over it the site has been going downhill and the number of scammers and fake buyers has gone through the roof getting as bad as ebay I guess the old idiom Birds of a feather is correct and they are all coming home to Gumtree and ebay to roost They no longer have any phone numbers have moved the support department to the corporate headquarters overseas yet are still claiming to be the local community noticeboard and that were proud to say that Gumtree is now loved by its ever growing community all around the world Yeah right The only ones loving it are the scammers because they are still allowed to operate freely using fake IPs while honest sellers are blacklisted
They did not change my size correctly even I paid money for changing fee
I am writing this because I am paying interest on my credit card for 4000  Your team is stop answering emails now I know trip beam is good in booking tickets but what if your clients in trouble Who is taking care of them Is there specific team Please give reply here now about my refund It would be wonderful if I got to know my refund date here and I would be happy to post back here that your team did good work Thank you

I have had a Fabletics membership for about a year now While I love the concept of ordering a new outfit a month there are some major issues that Fabletics needs to address
1 Prices have gone up You used to be able to get 3 piece sets for 4995 now you cannot or I havent seen it Majority of the sets fall in the 5995 price range they used to fall in the 4995 price range
2 Constantly out of stock an organization like this should know their database how many customers they have and how many projected orders they will have per monthforecast yet every single month they are out of stock or running low on stock Unacceptable
3 Quality Some orders I am so happy with the material and quality others the pieces are cheap thin and not sewn well together I ordered a pair of leggings I have always ordered a Small with no problem and wore them 23 times before they had a huge hole in the crotch
4 The recent I have no canceled is because I have heard that it is an absolute pain to cancelI dont feel like dealing with it so I skip most monthson the off chance that I can find a Small outfit in stock
Ordered my contacts on 3817 and charged for them Never received the item Phoned on 32817 and spoke to Andrea who saidOh they are on back order you should have received an email the day you ordered them
I did not
When speaking with Andrea32817 I complained because I was billed for an order that I have not received She said Oh we can send a partial order and you can get it in 36 days We will send the other box when it comes in
I told her that Ive been waiting for 20 days without seeing correctly I think the company can do better than that She said oh we are we are sending it priority mail with will take 36 days I was not satisfied and she had to get permission to overnight my contacts but it is to late today to do it so I should have them in2 days Unacceptable customer service I will not order from this company again
A usual good experience the cheese on my Ham and CHeese sub had gone bad and the mayo had already started to turn clear meaning it had been old mayo to begin with The French fries I ordered were ice cold and overcooked not even reheating them could salvage them My entire order was inedible
Dont trust Macys  buy expensive items you are not with a good hands
I just bought 2 Leather expensive sofas from Macys  Sacramento  after delivery I found out one of the sofa is way harder than the other one  its like seating in a hard chair  not comfortable at all  I called customer service within 20 minutes they scheduled for 6 days later to send inspector to check it out  Inspector came with comment that its going to be softer later on  he asked for my cell phone  called Mayss Customer service pass the phone to me  in sleazy way he disappeared  while I was listing to  Ivy  lectured me about leather furniture  We have several leather furniture non of them was or even close to such a bad uneven quality 
She rejected to exchange or I return them she threatened me that is going to cost me for pick up charge  usage charge  woow  
what a cheap service  Im in process to do legal action for my mistake trusting Mayss  Sam  M
Do your job I tracked the delivery progress ALL day it kept saying out for delivery then all of a sudden at 809pm the status change to attempt made but receiver not available A big lie I was home  NO ONE showed up Whoever had my package was too lazy to redeliver  just updated the status to go home for the evening Do you get paid to inconvenience the customer and lie about making a delivery  you did NOT UPS hire people that actually wants to work
If I could give half a star I would  Disgusting customer service this company was better when owned by low cost as bravofly is incredibly incompetent they will soon go bust as customer service is disgusting they advertise holidays and hotels that dont exist Ie you book your flight and hotel but will be messed about after payment with an email to say your booking is unconfirmed choose another hotel  even though ur hotel is still being advertised for exactly the same dates and price  Stay clear and use reputable sites Thomas cook etc
Dont use this company they will not tell you what you need to know  They will find ways to screw you out of money
I have bought several gifts cards while signed into my account and they NEVER reward me for my points I have sent several emails and they do not respond to them Responded one time and blamed med for not signing into my account or not using the correct site that gets credit Not customer oriented at all
If you travel with one way ticket and you are not sure about when your return date is dont deal with connections Cancelation and modification are ruinously expensive They wanted to charged me 350euros for a cancelation and more if I decided to change the date thats crazy This is cheaper to take the flight you want to change or cancel and after right take another plane back form where you took off 10hours before Definitely not green solution at all 
I contacted support 3 different times and was unable to get any kind of response or help My problem was that my account was not verified for MONTHS even though I was told it would take 12 days
So after emailing a couple of times and getting no response at all my account suddenly became verified It seems someone didnt do their job properly and when I enquired about it they realised this and quickly verified my account in a sneaky way without actually contacting me or acknowledging my problem
This is very concerning when I have thousands of dollars of my money in vaults It makes absolutely no sense at all that I am able to deposit my money without being a verified user but cant get it back without months of waiting and worrying For this alone gold money should be waiving fees attached to withdrawal of my money Having to pay to get my money back as well as deposit it is a joke You guys did the wrong thing were not contactable and are essentially ignoring my emails to this day
So when I finally became able to get my money from goldmoney vaults I made a mistake in the withdrawal amount and after contacting support once again via email they dont even have a contact number to try to fix the problem I was ignored
For me this meant that I wasnt able to withdraw all of my my money from goldmoney I wanted to cancel the transfer and try again but of course there will be a 25aus fee attached to that too even though it doesnt cost goldmoeny anything to get done
I was not able to cancel my withdrawal at all and did not even receive a response to my email about the mater Which means I cant withdraw the last 100 dollars of my money wihtout paying yet another fee and depositing more money for a fee in order to exceed the minimum withdrawal amount
This is an absolute joke and I would never recommend goldmoney to anyone My fees should be waived and my money should have been returned to me MONTHS before it was I also should have been contaced by customer support via email or phone I really needed this money months ago as I was desperate to make a few payments with it I was not able to get my money and it really costed me
Very sneaky business going on here They suck you in and then you will be stuck without access to your own money and no way to contact help Do not use goldmoney
Was ordering for the first time from them and oh my goodness what can ordeal had to change delivery address by phone thought nothing of it until a week later no sign of order but a letter saying my order was cancelled whoever took my details by phone had put my home address as business address for delivery therefore my card was declined as home address didnt matchnot even a phone call to explain this my order was a present for my daughters birthday thankfully I ordered it off a different company and it was ordered and delivered without a hitch NEVER AGAIN will I shop with Littlewoods
Hot Tank outside casing was all bent up not sure if it was sent that way or UPS dropped it  didnt have time to send it back as was heading north next day 
I have used Bookingcom many times and consider myself a valued customer
The Customer service is appalling They wont actually deal with you Hidden hotel charges which bookingcom do NOT advise you ofhad to cancel our holiday due to emergency surgery very stressful time anyway made worse by bookingcom s communications or lack of Couldnt even supply a cancellation notice for our insurance company
Very bad service will not be using them again
I stuck with the meal plan for a full month and lost 12 lbs which could simply be water weight on any given day I tried another month and lost 4 lbs  good but that shouldnt take a month Now I am a bit discouraged and have been eating out a bit so Ive gained the 56 lbs back again I am going to get back on the plan and give it one more month If I havent lost 2 lbs per week then I will stop This is a large expense for it not to work and I will not continue paying for a 4 lbmonth loss
Agrees to 940 had to pay 1040 was a very frustrating
After signing up with a free Netatmo I found the follow up service to using the item very unsatisfactory 
Even though you take the allinclusive insurance Goldcar still accuses people of having done things with the car that they didnt do for instance in my case soiling a seat which indeed I did NOT do Wont be using them again and will warn everyone I know against using Goldcar
I was charged double for a ticket flight from Cologne to Berlin please advise where shall I send the card statement for refund
I have discussed after long hours of waiting with your agent UTKARSH BANSAL and sent an email with the card statement and transactions codes
Please let me know when I will receive my refund
Its the second time when GLS delivers a package and says that nobody was at home when someone was at home the whole day When complained GLS said that I need to pick up my package from the parcel station that was 5 km away Its super annoying as it happened before already and such solution to the problem is very disappointing as they could have suggested to deliver a package again instead of sending me to the parcel station
I will not use the service Top up 5 but cut off after 7 minutes
Meant to have bonus
Bad connection
I order a product and they sent me a different one not pleased at all
Did not delivery on original scheduled date Then they rescheduled for the next date and didnt show up during the scheduled time I had to call and they finally showed up three hours later

tomtop orders takes month to get delivered and my last and final experience was fighting for my money for almost 4 month and could have got back just through paypal claim and i have never got the item just promises to be sent not recommended
Had a 150 surcharge added to a 5am service request in Miami Beach This is an unacceptable practice of Lyft My final ride with Lyft Hope it was worth it
I ordered chlorine tablets and pool shock The first shipment was unacceptable due to the condition of shock inside the shipping box Packages were sun faded and the cardboard box was disintegrated Outside shipment box was not damaged in any way I contacted the company and received apologies with a new shipment of pool shock The second shipment was identical to the first in the lack of quality and damaged goods The exterior shipping box was in great shape The person that pulled these orders intentionally put faded bags of pool shock with disintegrated cardboard packaging in the shipping box I contacted customer service in regards to the second shipment and have not received a reply in eleven days time I sent a video of me opening the second shipment and photos of both shipments My only comment to customer service after the second botched delivery was that I was speechless
the room that i had booked was not available
the owner offered us a room in another worst place of booked room on the homestay
the next day I went away in a beautiful home at a lower price
They refused to honor a discount I was given after taking a previous trip I was also initially charged a lower price only to be told later Id have to pay more Thats right they Quote d a price took my payment sent my receipt and trip confirmations and contacted me weeks later to say I owed more They were unresponsive to my initial questions about the increased fee and I started getting automated email warnings that my trip would be canceled and Id lose my original payment They also refused to honor the original price which again Id already paid in full and received confirmation for Since they already had my initial payment and I wasnt clear on whether that would be refunded or lost as their automated messages said that payment could not be refunded I went ahead and paid the additional price to protect the money Id already paid The trip itself was wonderfulabsolutely fantastic although it was subcontracted and so not run by Intrepid at all Turns out we could have booked the same trip at a lower price through other companies I cant say enough about how great the trip was thanks to our guide and how poorly we were treated by Intrepid customer service and taken advantage of by unscrupulous business practices
Goldcar has drawn illegal fees from my Mastercard They have invented a Diesel Feeon 12 EURO that they have taken
Also I asked to pay in EURO but they have deducted the money in DKK
Finally they charged 40 EURO from each of the 10 customers that were on a plane that was 10 minutes late I accept there may be a fee but 400 Euro is piracy
I have contacted them several times but they have not returned the money
More expensive than advertised
The printed price on the tickets I purchased was 28 I purchased 4 tickets and was charged 299 This is unreasonable The explanation was given in a rude unacceptable manner There was no chance of getting a refund There was no offering of making this experience less than the painful one it was
My original order was supposed to have been delivered on Saturday but was changed without notice to Monday By 530 on Monday the order still had not been delivered Using the customer service number was a disaster  could not understand the representative and she could not understand me I asked for the order to be cancelled and my money refunded if they could not get it delivered as promised No response Next stop  Better Business Bureau
I feel Ive been tricked into receiving unwanted emails from you I thought I was giving a review for one company  period Now Im being asked to review whatever I want Please take me off your email list Give an unsubscribe button on the emails you do send I assume you have my email address Please do not share my email address with any individuals companies or any other entities
What they dont tell you is that you can not benefit from any additional sale so you might as well just be a normal shopper because the monthly credits that come with the VIP program are just YOUR money Its a shame because I actually liked the product but cant bring myself to give the company any more of my money based on the way the do business
I ordered gluten free pasta from a local restaurant and foodler put in the order as regular pasta I tried a bite and could tell it wasnt gluten free and had to immediately spit it out I have a very serious allergy and this is not okay I called to customer service to get this straightened out and the lady put me on hold twice to call the restaurant then she said she was fixing my order and would call me back with the details She never called me back and I never got the correct food Im extremely upset with this horrible service and will never use foodler again and I suggest that you dont either
extremely helpful  patient with us
5 stars please DELL HELL NEVER WENT AWAY

The way Dell treats its small customers is ridiculous I ordered a  3000 Alienware desktop and a  1000 5K monitor The website mentioned that the PC would been send within 23 days I got the PC one month later
THE PC
After a week I already the PC because it didnt work at all It crashed constantly and when I contacted your Hell Support I was told to do a scan from one of your tools The scan took 8 hours while experts told me it should only take 30 minutes for a machine like I had
The scan finished and the results was laughable The computer was 100 fine while it crashed and showed me blue screens All of that within only ONE WEEK I took pictures from it and contacted Hell Support again They told me that if the results are OK that the computer is working fine No hardware trouble detected so the PC was fine according to Hell Support Even when I send them the evidence that my PC clearly wasnt working they kept saying that they couldnt do anything because they thought that the problems where probably software related According to Hell Support software issues arent treated as technical issues Seriously Why do I pay for support I dont get any Hell Support basically exists to tell people to f off and to take their s somewhere else
As a result Ive send the  3000 worthless piece of junk back to Dell Luckily I got my money back because I returned the product within 14 days I bought another PC with top quality hardware for the same price because the hardware from Dell isnt worth half of it There is enough proof on the internet from people who are complaining about the hardware as well Certainly from the power supply which is total crap in certain models
THE ORIGINAL MONITOR
Aaah yes the beautifull Dell UP2715K The first 5K monitor from Hell euh Dell No wait Hell was right
The monitor worked very well for a month UNTIL there appeared light flashed onto the monitor guided with the beautiful sound of electricity sparks This happened multiple times so I decided to contact Hell AGAIN
Hold tight because the fun now will really start
I contacted your great cough support service again and they told me they were going to send another monitor for replacement I WAS SHOCKED Wait what No hassle no question Too good to be true and so it was
THE 2ND MONITOR
When I received a replacement monitor I got a REFURBISHED model which looked like it was taking dust for years in a shed Nobody told me I would receive a refurbished model They value a brand new  1000 equal to a refurbished one The rubber feet came loose and the monitor showed colorated pixels on the borders I assume that the monitor wasnt glued 100 straight into the body So I decided to return that monitor as well But then the fun began
My contact claimed that according to the Terms  Conditions every monitor is replaced by a refurbished model and that the refurbished models are as good as the new ones and that they meet the high requirements from Dell I wrote him back saying that there isnt any word in the Terms  Conditions that states that monitors are replaced by refurbished models believe me Ive read it 4 times It isnt mentioned at all And I asked him if Dell had such a low high requirements since the refurbished model was total crap
No response for 4 days called Dell I was told to write a complaint letter Ive sent the guy an email AGAIN He replied the same day randomly asking for a service tag Ignoring my questions and once he lost his patience he said that I got a new monitor and if I had any complaints I had to write a letter I insisted to get a new monitor which I got after a while Luckily because after a week there were showing up clusters of dead pixels
THE 3RD MONITOR
So I received the 3rd monitor The monitor finally looked alright but there was one dead pixel Or its just dirt behind the glass which is glued onto the monitor Im not sure but it looks more like dirtdust I told the guy it was fine but after a couple of days I noticed that the glass panel is gettings loose at the side of the monitor At least 1 cm 04 inch and a light beam from at least 5 cm 2 inch shines trough the side So yes I asked for a replacement AGAIN because I dont want to take the risk that there would crawl a bug between the glass and the monitor and get stuck or that there would come dust underneath it
Misery again The monitor wasnt in stock anymore and I was told that it would be back in stock at this moment midmarch 2017 So I was asked to wait for a bit which I was willing to But after a couple of days I got a message from UPS that there was a package on its way I was surprised because I was told that the monitor wasnt in stock anymore So I got a bit suspicious but happy at the same time
The monitor was deliverd and gues what IT WAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MODEL Instead of sending me the 27 UP2715K 5K monitor theyve send me one of their 32 4K monitors WITHOUT TELLING ME
So I mailed that guy AGAIN and now he is ignoring me because I asked for a decent solution I proposed twice or maybe even 3 times to get my money back BUt they dont even answer on that They only keep sending their crappy monitors
So here I am 3 months and more than 60  mails later Still with a monitor that meets the high requirements from Dell This is pure bulls Dell only cares about their big clients  big companies I am really wondering how I would be threated if I would act as a CEO from a big company ordering 100 of those crap UP2715K models Id probablly get 5 for free then
FINAL WORDS
Dont buy Dell unless you like Hell I dont think this crap was resolved at anytime Dell Hell was always there and will always be there They dont care about you They only want your money They act like friendly pickpocketsfrauds and when they really feel that you wont give up They simply ignore you But Im not giving up Ill bother that crappy company for ever if I have to At this point I just want my money back since they dont comply with their legal obligations They feel powerful because who can touch them Theyd better watch out before Hell gets its hands on them
Went to your website i found the tickets went I try to finish to pay after I feel in all the information they price of that tickets change so I was not happy about that but I still bought them
Dont order things off them
First sell a model with a certain bundle you pay for this model Then 2 weeks are not sent they say that we will soon ship Then it turns out that there are no models with such a bundle and they send the model of poorer equipment for the same money No compensation is provided Very bad

Be sure to read what travel insurance covers I thought it would cover me in case of my flight was cancelled or delayed due to airline incompetence It does not Royal Air Maroc cancelled our flight and did not notify us It cost me an additional 1800 and is not covered by Workd Nomads Read your policy
I brought an car AC Compressor from DHGATE
When I asked the seller why hasnt shipped after 8 days  she explained to me that she had to wait for a supplier and she had to rely on others 
That she was an reseller not a manufacturer 
I asked her why she had told me  she was a manufacturer and she told me that DHGATE tells all there sellers to tell all there customers that she is manufacturer as customers like that better 
After all that we both agree to cancel the order and go our separate ways
But DHGATE will not Return my money for at lest 30 Business days
THAT IS DISGUSTING and UNACCEPTABLE
WHY IS IT ALLOWED  FOR DHGATE TO USE MY MONEY FOR 30 DAYS NO HAVE NO GOOD REASON  I have to wait 30  days to order again
UPDATE FROM PERVIOUS REVIEW
DHGATE IS A LAIR 
OF COURSE IM A CUSTOMER 
I HAVE BEEN ON YOU SUPPOSEDLY ONLINE CHAT FOR THE LAST 6 HOURS OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS  THATS RIGHT  SIX HOURS  TRYING TO RESOLVE THIS  AND I HAVE AN COPY OF ALL MY CHAT 
WITH ALL YOUR LIES 
ON placing the order for the cooker it was made very clear that it had to be delivered by a certain date in order to fit with the kitchen integration Despite several calls to chase the delivery on the specific date the soundstore could not reach the courier from Dimplex and we had to send the gas installers away After further chasing the cooker arrived the next day and we called out the gas installers once more We then discovered that Glen Dimplex has not included the conversion kit to bottled gas and has to send the gas installers away once more This was on a Wednesday Soundstore contacted Dimplex who waited another day to put the adaptors in normal post which meant they would not arrive until the following Monday On the Monday there were no adaptors in the post so soundstore had Dimplex send them by courier Eventually the cooker was installed by the Thursday 9 days late incurring the cost of 3 gas fitter call outs and lots of chasing by us and soundstore
So little inventory I was really disappointed
Every time I clicked on something I liked the colors I liked were sold out multiple sizes were sold out  at times they were either sold out completely or had one of the item left in stock at all Leggings capris tanks everything Stop running your ads if you dont have the inventory to accomidate the traffic  it makes you look bad
Fabletics has horrible customer service I wouldnt waste your money here I placed my first order with them and they sent me the wrong item When I called to have the correct item sent they refused to correct their error They made it sound like it had to be an exchange that I wanted and asked me to go out of my way to find a printer print the return label find a post office and pay for an exchange The problem here is that I never received the item I paid for After talking to a customer support supervisor he kept saying it was policy Though theres no standard policy for this since this is clearly an error made by their warehouse Its not an item I wanted to return or exchange Dont waste your time or money with Fabletics I cancelled my subscription immediately
On a number of occasions I have tried to contact Hostelworld to change a booking with no response despite Hostelworld advertising that they will get back to you within a day It appears that they avoid allowing you to easily change bookings by not getting back to customers to trap them into paying extra fees I will no longer use this company and would recommend everyone avoid using them
Besides the fact that the ticket choices are not laid out clearly the service fees are outrageous

We received a gift from a relative that we believe was supposed to be a Christmas gift but it came with a Valentines sticker on it What happened Also we were disappointed with the contents We were going to use the cheese and sausage for guests that were coming to visit but it wasnt enough for even two people sparingly Less packaging and more contents  we know that any of these are not inexpensive for the giftgiver Not good

Was told by salesperson that delivery persons will remove old bedding Delivery persons would not take mattress because there was a coffee stain on mattress Had I known this I would have planned differently and made my purchase elsewhere without this restriction Back to the small furniture store for me Should have stayed away from a big chain
When I received my package of ink one of my black ink cartridges had busted and I ended up with black ink all over my hands and had to attend class with stained black hands I eventually threw that one away and replaced it with another So I was shorted what I paid for Will use another discount ink purchasing website next time
I purchased 3 promotions  I do not have a smart phone  I make a copy of the voucher and contact the merchant to redeem my purchase  I may not redeem it for several weeks but having it on my board helps me to remember my purchase
According to understanding of what your page states to view I have to be ready to redeem when I open
I HAVE sent a inquiry regarding my assumption and HAVE NOT gotten a reply  Ya care  answer your E Mails
The offers were great I picked my two pairs of leggings and when I went to checkout I was directed to another page with lots of great offers I added a tank and a sports bra which advertised a combined total of 20 together Then when I went to checkout the offers had disappeared and the offers I chose came to more than 50 combined I was not happy I removed them from my cart and will probably not continue a membership with them due to this issue

The company did not delivered the order After one month of emails and dispute to PayPal they answered that they will send me my order if firstly I had withdrawn my dispute In a sense of good willing I wrongly closed the dispute Finally I received a letter that my order is not available
No Refund was done yet
DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY 
IT IS A FRAUD WITH NO CUSTOMER SERVICE
Tickets that I thought I had paid for yes  was taken from account were not actually available Company cancelled order 2 days before venue  Awful experience
Ordered a small drone Unit was delivered with a broken remote control cracked screen They kept insisting on a video to see if there was a fix Then they said they to ship it back at my expense and they would review I order a LOT of stuff online including from China This is one of the worst experiences I have ever had I would NOT recommend
Half of my order was canceled withrout my knowing so until the delivery arrived I saw the pending charges on my account but when they canceled one of my items because they didnt actually have it in stock the final charge o my reflected one order I was never notified about the shortage It took over a week to get a response from customer service and no consolationwas offered Their inventory system sucks and their customer support is worse
I ordered my comtacts on Feb 14th There was a delay because of the manufacturer I desperately needed my contacts so I paid for overnight shipping When my contacts were shipped I received a delivery status saying they would be overnighted on Feb 28th That did not happen when I checked the tracking they were not set up as overnight I paid expensive shipping for nothing I am pulling my business accounts and personal accounts and will no longer be a customer
I topped off my phone number last Tuesday and it still has yet to be applied My PayPal has been charged but my account is still not reflecting the payment
Yo he comprado continental contact 100 y he recivido el continental contact 200
They Quote d me 500 for a flight which was cheaper than what I was finding I made the mistake of calling They told me the price available was 750 way more than Quote d and also more expensive than what I was finding other places They since have called me 4 times a day at all hours for the last week Ive repeatedly told them Ive already purchased the tickets for less than what they were offering They also use different numbers so you cant even block them Theyre a joke and a waste of time If booking a flight I like to use skyscanner they typically have the cheapest flights
Worst Customer service
Software has repeatedly crashed on the companys end not on my end Customer support does not exist here I have called them a dozen of times and email them a dozen of times and they never gotten back to me Otherwise anyone going through this issue to contact the governors office
service was terrible and i received a dirty car without the full fuel of tank Complained but still waiting a response from their customer service and management and this was 2 weeks ago
I recently ordered four floater frames I ordered them to the size of the canvas When the frames arrived I couldnt get the canvases into the frames because they were so tight I hadnt accounted for the width of the actual canvas over the stretcher bars Shipping them back cost me 65 plus a 20 restocking fee When you order a 20 x 24 frame that is exactly the measurement of the frame not the inside area where the canvas sits
Their ISBN numbers are mixed up with different versions It tooks multiple emails over multiple daysweeks to get a single response back Absolutely terrible Choose Chegg or any other even if it is for less money and you still end with the better deal
The internet price is not final I had to pay 50 more due to unexpected fees from Goldcar
And changing the return hour is a BIG problem too Not a good service 
Wear is my tickets
Kohlscom has no concept of how to properly do online mail order I have had nothing but negative experiences with them recently on several orders two quite large I placed recently They really should shut down their ordering business untilunless they learn how to handle ordering appropriately following companies like Amazon for example
Among the problems I had most recently is one where two items out of a fairly sizable order around 20 different items were not shipped The enclosed invoices in two of the partial ordersthe 20 items were shipped in 68 separate mailings for some reason suggesting to me that perhaps they ship from their multiple stores around the country not a central warehouseshowed bills for two items I had not ordered and in fact did not receive
On the later when I called at least kohlscom confirmed I was only billed the full amount for what I ordered not for what the enclosed invoices showed items that were not shipped Why on earth does Kohls do that in the first place They really need to clean up their shipping invoices
Howeverand more importantlyI did not receive two items I DID order And two items that I WAS charged 50 for as my credit card statement clearly showed
So I called kohlscom and asked them to ship the two missing items They said they could issue me instore credit I live several hours from the nearest store or if I wanted the missing items shipped I would have to pay for them I already had paid for them and pay the 895 shipping That is beyond bizarreI already paid for them but to receive them I have to pay for them twice That obviously makes no sense and surely is illegal as well so I asked to talk to a supervisor who told me the same thing
I tried contacting support online and also got the same ridiculous responses
Note clearly the items were instock or several representatives including supervisors would not have said they could ship them to me if Id pay for them again
In the meantime I had gotten a mailed thank you card signed supposedly by the president and CEO of Kohls Kevin Mandell The card says Customers like you are the reason we work so hard to deliver the great shopping experience products and value that you deserve
HUH What great shopping experience that I deserve Ripping me off on two items expecting me to pay for them twice
So I searched online and found the email address for Mr Mandell and sent him an email The same day I got a reply from Joni identified as ACE Sr Executive Correspondence Advisor Office of the President After several rounds of email and phone tag with her she again asked for my name email address and phone all three of which I had given her earlierand said shed process a refund for me
She too claimed she cannot have the items shipped to methe items I have been billed for I replied to her that she certainly can She can place the order herself charge it to the CEOs credit card if need be and send me the missing 50 items I have not had a response from her on that yet
Of course any company that understands mail order whether amazoncom or any of many many others I frequently order online from would have instantly sent me the two missing items with an apology Not Kohls however
Well at this point Joni has refunded a whopping 12 to my credit card and given me 15 in ridiculous Kohls Cashwhen I had paid by credit card for more than the 50 owed to me for the missing items So 27 out of the 50shorting me still 23 if one includes the Kohls Cash shorting me 38 if I exclude that which of course can only be used on their products and only for a very limited time period and if I cant get to the distant closest store I have to pay more than half of that amount again for shippinganother 895
That obviously is not acceptable I have not heard back from her after I told her again to send me the missing items but I believe shes been out of the office for a couple days Ill update this review IF anything improves with kohlscom but with the horrible experience so far even from the Office of the President I am not holding my breath
In my experience kohlscom is a total disaster including up to the top of the organization I will be avoiding them and warn others to be prepared if you try doing business with them
I would like to claim for a refund as I would not be able to attend this event no more and would be a waste
Honestly Im not one to write reviews but this was a must This company claim to be cheaper but its a Scam I was booking online but I didnt have the option for wheelchair access when flying so I called and waited 25 minutes to speak with someone it was very difficult to understand the man as I tried to give him my almost booked online flight details He advised me that he would have to book for me since there was no wheelchair option for me to choose he explained that we could have called after booking for the option Once he finished with the exact flight information he told me the price went up 15000 per person so I decided not to book as he explained the prices fluctuate every 5 hours I went back online to check the price It did go up as he said so I switched the flight dates and found the same price I wanted flying a few days later Once I filled out all my flight information and processed my payment It notified me once again that the price increased by 100 per person so much for every 5 hours Im not sure if this is a norm with this site and if so you are cheating many people As a frequent traveller Ive never had to deal with a scam such as this
Total waste of time

Their staff doesnt speak a sufficient level of english Its not that im uncomfortable speaking to them its their level They cant spell and have a very limited vocabulary this makes it impossible having a conversation with the staff Furthermore the waiting times are always over 30 min if you dont get kicked off before They have the Longest Go press 1 for  process ive ever experienced Evertime you speak with them they give conflicting information
JUST DONT DO IT
5 stars please DELL HELL NEVER WENT AWAY

The way Dell treats its small customers is ridiculous I ordered a  3000 Alienware desktop and a  1000 5K monitor The website mentioned that the PC would been send within 23 days I got the PC one month later
THE PC
After a week I already the PC because it didnt work at all It crashed constantly and when I contacted your Hell Support I was told to do a scan from one of your tools The scan took 8 hours while experts told me it should only take 30 minutes for a machine like I had
The scan finished and the results was laughable The computer was 100 fine while it crashed and showed me blue screens All of that within only ONE WEEK I took pictures from it and contacted Hell Support again They told me that if the results are OK that the computer is working fine No hardware trouble detected so the PC was fine according to Hell Support Even when I send them the evidence that my PC clearly wasnt working they kept saying that they couldnt do anything because they thought that the problems where probably software related According to Hell Support software issues arent treated as technical issues Seriously Why do I pay for support I dont get any Hell Support basically exists to tell people to f off and to take their s somewhere else
As a result Ive send the  3000 worthless piece of junk back to Dell Luckily I got my money back because I returned the product within 14 days I bought another PC with top quality hardware for the same price because the hardware from Dell isnt worth half of it There is enough proof on the internet from people who are complaining about the hardware as well Certainly from the power supply which is total crap in certain models
THE ORIGINAL MONITOR
Aaah yes the beautifull Dell UP2715K The first 5K monitor from Hell euh Dell No wait Hell was right
The monitor worked very well for a month UNTIL there appeared light flashed onto the monitor guided with the beautiful sound of electricity sparks This happened multiple times so I decided to contact Hell AGAIN
Hold tight because the fun now will really start
I contacted your great cough support service again and they told me they were going to send another monitor for replacement I WAS SHOCKED Wait what No hassle no question Too good to be true and so it was
THE 2ND MONITOR
When I received a replacement monitor I got a REFURBISHED model which looked like it was taking dust for years in a shed Nobody told me I would receive a refurbished model They value a brand new  1000 equal to a refurbished one The rubber feet came loose and the monitor showed colorated pixels on the borders I assume that the monitor wasnt glued 100 straight into the body So I decided to return that monitor as well But then the fun began
My contact claimed that according to the Terms  Conditions every monitor is replaced by a refurbished model and that the refurbished models are as good as the new ones and that they meet the high requirements from Dell I wrote him back saying that there isnt any word in the Terms  Conditions that states that monitors are replaced by refurbished models believe me Ive read it 4 times It isnt mentioned at all And I asked him if Dell had such a low high requirements since the refurbished model was total crap
No response for 4 days called Dell I was told to write a complaint letter Ive sent the guy an email AGAIN He replied the same day randomly asking for a service tag Ignoring my questions and once he lost his patience he said that I got a new monitor and if I had any complaints I had to write a letter I insisted to get a new monitor which I got after a while Luckily because after a week there were showing up clusters of dead pixels
THE 3RD MONITOR
So I received the 3rd monitor The monitor finally looked alright but there was one dead pixel Or its just dirt behind the glass which is glued onto the monitor Im not sure but it looks more like dirtdust I told the guy it was fine but after a couple of days I noticed that the glass panel is gettings loose at the side of the monitor At least 1 cm 04 inch and a light beam from at least 5 cm 2 inch shines trough the side So yes I asked for a replacement AGAIN because I dont want to take the risk that there would crawl a bug between the glass and the monitor and get stuck or that there would come dust underneath it
Misery again The monitor wasnt in stock anymore and I was told that it would be back in stock at this moment midmarch 2017 So I was asked to wait for a bit which I was willing to But after a couple of days I got a message from UPS that there was a package on its way I was surprised because I was told that the monitor wasnt in stock anymore So I got a bit suspicious but happy at the same time
The monitor was deliverd and gues what IT WAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MODEL Instead of sending me the 27 UP2715K 5K monitor theyve send me one of their 32 4K monitors WITHOUT TELLING ME
So I mailed that guy AGAIN and now he is ignoring me because I asked for a decent solution I proposed twice or maybe even 3 times to get my money back BUt they dont even answer on that They only keep sending their crappy monitors
So here I am 3 months and more than 60  mails later Still with a monitor that meets the high requirements from Dell This is pure bulls Dell only cares about their big clients  big companies I am really wondering how I would be threated if I would act as a CEO from a big company ordering 100 of those crap UP2715K models Id probablly get 5 for free then
FINAL WORDS
Dont buy Dell unless you like Hell I dont think this crap was resolved at anytime Dell Hell was always there and will always be there They dont care about you They only want your money They act like friendly pickpocketsfrauds and when they really feel that you wont give up They simply ignore you But Im not giving up Ill bother that crappy company for ever if I have to At this point I just want my money back since they dont comply with their legal obligations They feel powerful because who can touch them Theyd better watch out before Hell gets its hands on them
Unwilling to work with customers regarding their return policy including exchanges of a product with the tags still on and never been worn I would not recommend to anybody and would not have ordered from here had it not been for a wedding Also does not seem true to size Just a bad experience all around
A promised box of food that never comes leaves me hungry
As a seller I have never had a single case against me on PayPal and my account is approx 6 years old
However recently I had a buyer open a PayPal dispute suggesting that the item was not as described
We responded to the case with actual proof via the original listing invoice and also email sent to the buyer Which clearly showed we are not in the wrong
Now PayPal none the less ask the buyer to return the item but stop short of saying the buyer is in the right Instead informing me that they have chosen to ask the buyer to exercise there returns under UK law aka cooling off period
I say fair enough as they are paying returns but I do expect to have at least 12 to 48 hours to at least collect the item from the drop off point and also inspect it to make sure it is as was sent out ie complete undamaged
They originally gave the buyer 10 days to return it However the buyer does not do so and I phone them on the 10th day saying nothing has been received and neither has the tracking been provided How am I supposed to conduct business as I can resell the item until it is back in a fair and reasonable time frame They now try and tell me they are giving the buyer more time and in fact they dont consider it have to be returned simply that some kind of valid tracking is provided by the 10th day And according to there records the buyer just provided it today Even thought they have not actually posted it
So I have to wait a further week and when it arrives PayPal immediately refunds the buyer as soon as the tracking shows it as arrived There by not only not giving us any chance to pick up the item from the collection point let alone actually inspect the item
We contact them and they fob us off telling us thats there policy And tell us that if there is a problem then appeal it After much arguing and debate they wont help so we are not happy at all but consider it a learning lesson as long as the item is ok
However upon inspection we find the item is damaged and altered So we contact PayPal again and ask them now what Considering they have given the money back already without gving us any opportunity while the buyer was actually given more time than was originally generously granted to them
They inform us we need to get third party written evidence and if that is provided then there is no problem we will win and be reimbursed
We cite the concern that we will have to waste time and also money in obtaining the third party document and so want assurance that this is the case as otherwise we could be further out of pocket They assure us this would not be the case as long as we get the evidence
We do this and provide well within the time frame and even though we do indeed win the case They dont reimburse us but instead all they do is give us this message 
Please contact the buyer to have the refund issued from your account returned to you
So basically no only did there direct actions and also advice have put me in a state of loss without recourse And they have also mislead me into believe I would be reimbursed and NOT in any financial loss after I would win the case
THIS is apparently what they call Seller Protection In basic terms it is worth ZERO As the adage goes not even worth the paper it is written on
Some of the businesses were really shiny  Do your own research with long term suppliers
This is the second time I have had terrible service from Doyouspaincom I guess I should learn from my mistakes Now due to them changing their conditions and price at such short notice I have had to cancel the booking and contract another company at a higher price Even though they have already charged me for something which I wont be able to use Never again
Avoid this company
I payed for cancellation insurance on an internal flight in vietnam and then because of unforseen circumstances at home needed to cancel the flight and book an earlier one
Is this not what cancellation insurance is for
Not for lastminutecom apparently needing to cancel a flight even with cancellation insurance is not aloud my one saving grace was that it was still within 14 days and I could cancel my cancellation insurance
Hip hip I got a voucher for 10 that I could spend when booking with lastminuitecom  I think they will end up keeping that
They do seem pretty good at copying and pasting the same stupid comment to every bad review tho they did the same on Facebook and dont get back to you 
You were good at one timebut nownot so good
very bad screen
Did not receive my order and I let them talk me into paying with a check against my better judgement its easy to get a hold of them until they get your money dont send them any money ITS A TOTAL SCAM
I bought the ticket and I can not be in that day at the event
I wrote you about this and ask to cancel and to get back part of the money You didnt answer me
Please cancel my order and send me back part of the money I should get
Thank you
Dann Granot
I have waited for over 10 days and still no reply about a refund to a flight that the airline has cancelled
Now im stock with only the flight back because there are no tickets available
The company dont care about the customers only the money
Dont ever order with them
I was very happy at first with tailscom Ruby my Bullmastiff seemed to enjoy it and it was deivered on time However after a while she began to shed excessively and was constantly hungry even when I upped her feed I looked deeper into this and I noticed quite a few other customers have had the same problem Their customer service team didnt want to help nor did they seem interested for the wellbeing of my dog So I switched immediately to a different brand Guru cold pressed it was more expensive but worth every penny Within a week of switching Rubys fur went back to normal her constent hunger is also now a thing of the past and she looks extremely healthy If you love your pet and want the best then stay clear of Tailscom
I ordered Juno compression socks from Lympodema and was not told that some of the socks were on backorder The only way I knew this was because I had called customer support and they told me As of this writing I still have not received the products I ordered but the support representative was very helpful and was kind enough to refund the extra money I had spent on faster delivery I will be happy to leave a product review if and when I receive the socks
Sure got tickets only showed two you pay clearly for not booking 6 months ahead Sometime unavoidable Tickets were way too expensive and you feel ripped off when you know everybody arounf you only paid 97 and you had to pay 255 each
I have booked my flight 3 days ago and although I have received a confirmation email Eticket is still missing And reading the reviews in this page has realized me that it is not uncommon for gate1nl
I want a contact number through which I can contact and get it sorted out
I have mailed them thrice in 2 days but all I have received is the automatically generated emails
Someone pleaes tell me If i have the confirmation email as well as Reservation number can i collect my ticket at the airport if E ticket is not provided to me by the time my travelling days come near
regards
David Sklar has no interest in the clients they are serving They dont make clear how they calculate what is owing including their fees Any opportunity for you to pay the creditor more theyll grab They never fight for your right You end up paying more than the original interest Only thing that happens is the calls stop
Waited 2 hours to be assisted by a person that was not happy to be employed The car was not anywhere close to where he said it was outside When I asked another employee they said youll have to look for it 
Yesterday I made a reservation with AMOMAcom for a hotel in Lisboa When Im finished the reservation I realized that Im wrong with the dates at that moment and I tried to solved the problem but I couldnt
During today Ive try to call Amoma finally at this afternoon someone answered my phone call and says me that if the hotel accept the change they dont have any problem
That only I have to do is send a mail with the confirm the change the dates from the hotel Ive done but no one until now contact me to say if the change are ok or not
I think that the call service are very badly
And if someone ask me about this company obviusly my answer will be dont use it
I was waiting for a TV to arrive on friday night I was told it would arrive between 1721 and that Bring would call before Never received a call Did however see your courier arrive 2030 pull the TV out of the van and drop it on the pavement leaving it on the side When I opened the box the side of the screen was cracked and not fully attached to the rest of the screen The broken side was the same side the courier had thrown it on the pavement Thank you for a ruined night and a ruined TV
Size was wrong even though we measured according to the guide I ask to return was told no
Because of going through this site they held 2k on reserve for a week Ridiculous
I place an order and provided jpeg for customization weeks before I needed them I was told I would have them in hand on a specific date and trusted that I would When I followed up the week prior to promised delivery date I heard nothing back I followed up again on the delivery date and they told me they hadnt heard back from me to confirm their proof which they claimed they sent I went back in my email and junk mail and nothing was received for me to proof The only thing was an email confirming receipt of jpeg and promised delivery date Not only did they drop the ball they lied about it So much for customer service I have found a new source for my customized USB that will pick up where this company dropped the ball I would never recommend this company to anyone
Complaint amendment  Due to the fact that I the customer am not privy to your order protocol that should be explained by the sales rep when the order is being placed in good faith the response to my complaint is unacceptable I dont believe you treat your customers well instead lay balme on them when you mess up an order If anyone wishes to be treated this way then they should use your company If they wish to order something w a sales rep they should be directed to a website that prompts them through the ordering process Clearly the live sales rep model doesnt work well for USB Canada Ive already ordered my replacement USBs from a company that will have them here by Friday Now THAT is service
They say you have to sign for the package when its delivered As for my case I havent recieved the goods and when asked no one takes the blaim After countless emails that Ive written they say its on DHL and the DHL blains on SSense which neither party takes the fault I wont be using SSense afyer this terrible customer care service
Only after filling forms and providing documents do they inform me that I have to buy in order to be allowed to sell I will tell everyone to avoid this company like the plague Dishonest and manipulative to the max
Thoughs that have borrowed more than twice should be able to borrow more than getting less than 1000
I would have purchased several more items if they had been available in my size Almost everything I clicked on was only available in XXS Too bad
Very disappointed My husband ordered tickets and was not aware of the tremendous mark up until after It was too late to do anything about it
APRES 2 SEMAINES JE SUIS TOUJOURS EN ATTENTE D UN REMBOURSEMENT
DELAI BIEN TROP LONG
They made a mistake with the address saying it is incomplete and are blaming either myself or amazon for it when there was never a problem with other amazon deliveries So they had to correct the address and relabel which for some reason requires 24 hours delay Since the package arrived at sorting 5 hours before they send out their delivery guys they is enough time for them to correct their own mistakes with the address in their system If it is amazon somehow sending incorrect address then purolator need to check their system on how they information from amazon because no other courier or delivery company had a problem with other stuff ordered from amazon using the same address
Im waiting for my couch
We chose a Cooper love seat and sofa set from clearance Maleesa was great she was our salesperson
When the delivery attempt was made thats when we learned that wed have to have it disassembled Finewe called to have that done but because it was still on the truck our helper named Sade would have to call us back She said itd be after four when the couch came back off the truck
She never called
I called back at 5 6 7 and 8pm and couldnt get through I couldnt leave a message because it wouldnt route me back to VM
So follow up is not real at Gardner White nor is customer service after the sale And thats too bad
PureFormulas has an unusual return policy that leads me to never buy from them again I thought I could return the Vegan Evening Primrose Oil that gave me unrelenting heartburn for 3 miserable days but they refused to because the bottle was opened A far cry from the Vitamin Shoppe who accepts returns regardless and who are compassionate to those people like me who suffer from food and you name it sensitivities Make sure if you buy from PureFormulas that you do NOT need to return the product
Ive always had great drivers but the customer service help line is the worst Ive experienced in decades
I thought that I had left my phone in the back seat of a cab today When I called the customer service line I followed the instructions on the automated menu which clearly states if this is not an emergency and you would like to remain on hold to speak to a customer service representative press 1 I did so and waited for over twenty minutes and the person who picked up asked whats your emergency then argued with me about this being an emergency line and my lost phone was not an emergency but why would I wait for 20 minutes if this was an emergency
Afterwards the rep Refused to call the driver and asked me to use the lyft app to file a lost and found claim How am I supposed to do that without my phone Thats loterally why Im calling them and I am using someone elses phone The rep refused to let me talk to their supervisor and refused to connect me to another human being who would help me and said we do these claims by email only The wouldnt look me up by name either
WORST SERVICE EVER
I feel bad for the drivers because they are actually decent people
PER DUE GIORNI DI SEGUITO HO TELEFONATO PER ASSISTENZA MA NON SONO RIUSCITA A PARLARE CON NESSUNO HO INVIATO DUE MAIL ALLASSISTENZA E ANCHE LI NESSUNA RISPOSTA HO INVIATO MESSAGGIO CON MESSANGER MA ANCORA DEVO AVERE UNA RISPOSTA MI AUGURO CHE PER LA PRENOTAZIONE DI DUE COFANETTI NON SIA UGUALE
When checking out I got the error server error try again After several tries I called the number for their sales dept  they just answer the phone Hello instead of identifying themselves Transferred me to someone who wasnt available and I wound up in their voicemail Used their online chat they suggested to try the Paypal checkout That ended with an Order could not be placed error  but the chat agent says the order went through Very sketchy  wont be shopping here again
your staff didnt tell me one of my production has been sold out then sent me the parcel directly
A nightmare if the item you received is faulty They wont replace the item or refund I had to go back to the credit card company to get a refund
First of all I called them to say I would be late for my 12 o clock appointment I arrived there at exactly 1202 and asked to wait for 5mins because my hairdresser was still with their other client When he sees me he then tells my my brown hair is too dark for silver heighlights I said I was told it would take a couple of applications but it was possible He then tells me no I cant have it this I dont understand as there are plenty of women with black hair and silver highlights He then pushed twice for me to have my hair cut Eventhough I said I didnt want it cut He then tells me I wouldnt have been able to have my colour done today anyway as it would take too long and I was late All in all it was terrible service I am now having my hair done at a different hairdressers who say the colour silver is possible for my hair I couldnt believe they blamed me for being late when he was still working on someone else Would defiantly not recommend these pushy and abrupt hairdressers
Virtually impossible to contact this company When I finally did operator was powerless to do anything Arranged a call back which never occurred Emails ignored I would not recommend this company to anyone
I recently tried HelloFresh on a friends recommendation while I was temporarily renting a home in San Francisco Unfortunately I was automatically signed up for a subscription with no confirmation or verification email It wasnt until 2 days ago that I saw a charge on my credit card for 59 and looked into it further The box is going to be delivered on Friday to an address where no one lives I immediately contacted customer service explaining the situation and asking if there was a way to stop the delivery and if I could get a refund Just today I heard back They apparently have a strict billing policy and cannot offer a full or partial refund or any sort of credit to compensate me for the mistake They offered no solution or even acknowledged the problem that a box of food will be rotting at a home where no one lives I have chosen Blue Apron a service that offers very clear and helpful notifications on shipments and account changes
I would not recommend this company since their products are in poor quality and they do not offer a refund Hence Clothes2ordercom do not respect basic consumer rights and do not offer a resolution
I was excited about booking my trip to visit my family during Easter time in Greece
I called in to book my flight with the agents on the phone but every price we chose wasnt available as we attempted to finalizefrom 1200 my flight jumped up to 14001500
this was non stop for about an hour or so
Finally I booked a flight myself on the website for less than what the agents were able to find for meI later called in like the agent said to so I receive a 3050 credit on my invoice as they promissed me but they finally couldnt do anything Sadly at this point of time I am feeling very disappointed and reluctant in wanting to book again with this site
I hope something can be done
Overall experience was fine until our interactions with the quality compliance team Regardless of Trust Pilots own policies their compliance team does not abide by them In other words your customers can write lies and name competitors in their reviews and Trust Pilots compliance team will not remove them even after youve proven the lie This is a clear contradiction of Trust Pilots guidelines and they simply dont abide by them
Response to Your Response
Thank you for the reply Id like to point out as a customer I have the right to review Trust Pilot based on the service experience Part of Trust Pilots service experience is the User Guidelines theyyou chose to operate by With that said I dont agree with the Guidelines andor at least the way they are written Secondly Im confident your compliance team is either not following the Guidelines or using poor discretion at a minimum
Furthermore most if not all of the guidelines are written speaking to the customer not the business This means as a business disputing a review I have to read through sections and think of the experience as if I was in a reverse roll in order to figure out what compliance actually means Example Title of paragraph When do we ask you to change your review That particular paragraph speaks directly to a customer that is going to leave a review There arent any paragraphs that are titled When is a good time to dispute a customer review See the difference Were a business but youre sending us Guidelines that are entirely worded as if were the customer leaving the review
Here are some direct Quote s from Trust Pilots guidelines
Section 52 on Asking to Change a Review
First Bullet Point Your review contains language that  includes defamatory statements
Third Bullet Point The content of your review appears to be solely concerned with  valueladen opinion as opposed to a Service Experience
Section 6 on Review Removal
Opening Paragraph shows you have discretion IMO we reserve the right to remove reviews that we determine violate these Guidelines  Examples of when we may remove your review include but are not limited to
Third Bullet Point Your review doesnt appear to be based on a genuine Service Experience eg it is a fabricated review see clause 11 below
From Clause 11 First ParagraphOpening Statement Our aim is to create and maintain a bestinclass online review community where you can freely share your Service Experiences with the Company and thereby provide an informative and fair view of the Companys services
Third Paragraph of Clause 11 We have a zerotolerance policy against fabricated reviews  we cannot under any circumstances accept fabricated reviews This includes reviews that are not an expression of a genuine Service Experience
Fifth Paragraph of Clause 11  Reviews that we deem false fabricated or similar will be removed
Note Deem False  fabricated or similar once again shows you can use discretion
I recognize that our Service Rating is in the mid 9s and overall our ratings are awesome on Trust Pilot With that said when a customer flat out lies and makes it public information through your platform were going to put up some resistance as you would do the same if we spread lies about Trust Pilot That is public information that could receive 100s or 1000s of view over time Trust Pilots disclaimer to not get involved with cases of trueuntrue course of events would be understandable in some scenarios that can not be proven however in our instances of disputing weve only disputed lies false statements defamatory statements valueladen opinions that are clear as day and easily proven to be false without doubt Your disclaimer is weak compared to the repetitive statements regarding Trust Pilots desire for genuine reviews and keeping fabrication off the platform Until there is clarification within your Guidelines my opinion stands
and then promised prices no longer available
We ordered 3 big items all off which were delivered damaged Reported damage as soon as items were delivered advised they would replace parts 3 months and numerous emails and phone calls from us to them with next to no response back Including manger not returning call when promised some random parts turned up not even for our purchases Now almost 4 months post purchase No communication and no correct parts
I ordered a bouquet on Sunday for delivery on Monday afternoon By Tuesday late afternoon Euroflorist were unable to tell me whether the order had been processed by the florist or whether the flowers had been delivered or not On Wednesday morning they emailed me to say they hadnt been delivered I cancelled my order and wont use this company again  while the customer service people were very amenable on the telephone the actual service provided was extremely disappointing
Im like so disappointed I purchase lots of articles of clothing from your website and I find usually that my items go on sale after I purchased them with one week or 2 Not fair not fun
Thanks I love your website regardless
received wrong size they say to send back and they will hold a pair my size turns out they never hold my size got a refund
I havent received my order yet I was told 48 days and still nothing in the mail They really should give out tracking numbers for all orders and maybe RESPOND WHEN PEOPLE EMAIL YOU Ive sent 4 emails and all have gone unanswered
Bought a Ulefone Armor paid for expedited delivery it took 25 days to arrive as Coolicool pushed out the expected delivery time Experienced screen problems with the Armor screen dimmed and eventually went black and the phone was very hot it was unusable after only 16 days
I contacted Coolicool support on Jan 17 2017 after emails from support with suggestions from their engineer which did not help I eventually got an address from Coolicool to return the phone for repair although their customer service said they would replace or refund me and returned the phone to Ulefone as they seemed reasonable
Once Ulefone had my phone they emailed and said that they would not replace the phone or refund because it was out of the 15 day replacementrefund warranty period fair enough the phone did indeed have the issues from day 16 of my ownership Repairs were estimated to take 5 weeks
Next I receive an email saying they have looked at the phone and the repair will cost 38 because they have determined it is damage not a fault due to manufacture This is complete rubbish the phone was never damaged by me in the short time I had it So I wrote to Coolicool disputing that it was damage asked them to describe what the damage is and told them I should not be responsible for the repair costs as it is definitely a fault with the phone and it is still under the 12 month warranty for repair Coolicool have now stopped replying to my emails Effectively they are holding my phone ransom
Big lesson for myself here and I will not purchase from Coolicool or similarly located companies again
I have a Rynair flight tonight which I am unable to check in to online due to some issues I spent half an hour talking to two customer service agents the first said she would call me back in an hour it was 8 hours ago and the other promised that it would be solved by yesterday
Rynair charges 45 EUR for airport checkin which is more than half of my return flight Am I supposed to pay this because of your incompetence and unresponsiveness I would have needed to check in yesterday because I dont have access to printer today This is absurd please figure this out or refund me for my return flight plus all the money I spent on talking to customer service on the phone adding up another half of my return flight
Purchased a few items from them had a couple to return because they didnt look the part and sizing was off which made me question their authenticity
Exhausted all contact forms  phone emailed and Whattsapp  for more than a week and never got a word from them about return procedures or refund
Finally gave up contacted Paypal and opened a claim they were the ones that refunded me via their buyer protection
Realised they had taken 400 euros off my credit card when I returned to the UK
The car had many dents and scratches when I picked it up and there were no new ones added by myself
The person when I returned the car said all was fine
Knowone answered my telephone call nor my attempts to chat Rediculous
To be honest Im not finding my experience with Energia to be a good one I did not realize that I would have to submit meter readings  when I go to log into my account it does not recognize me or my email so now I have to ring them
After experiencing the good side of this company when I had my car serviced and motd  I had no problem recommending them to others
When my sons BMW was due a service we arranged an appointment through Servicing Stop for 2 days time However the next day they emailed us to cancel and reappoint to the following Monday On the Sunday before they cancelled again to the Thursday
Can u guess what happened then Yep the weds before they cancelled til the following Monday
Not once did they offer any sort of apology or reason
In the end my son rang them and cancelled He was told  ok we will cancel your appointment and that was it
We ended going to a local garage and they were great
I sent an email 12 days ago expressing my dissatisfaction received a reply saying that they  were working hard to deal with my complaint and someone would be in touch in 23 days
After 7 days nothing Sent another email and still nothing 
Certainly wont be using them again and have spread the word to all the people who Id recommended them too
it was reaaaaly long and the quality of my sunglasses are not nice 
Was promised a 30 coupon if I downloaded the app and place a first time order But i didnt get the coupon
Non  arrivato niente a casa
Delivered 1 out of 5 items Could not deliver remaining items Then wanted thank you for agreeing not to charge for the servicefood they never provided And for the 3rd straight time driver went to wrong address Have used them for a year but likely will find someone else
Update response from Foodler indicates they wont even refund entire charge They expect me to continue to cover tax and tip on an order that they failed to deliver I did not think this experience could get worse but theyve done it
Tried unsuccessfully to book used the directory enquiries as prompted charged 587 for 18secs 
and 1376 for 3min 39secs on 118023 without costs disclosed
My bank account charged 11600 without a booking charges stopped
I ordered stainless steel bracelets from their company but what I received isnt even big enough for my 2 year old daughter When I complained that the measurements were inaccurate they changed them on the website to reflect the teeny tiny bracelets they sent me and then told me I received what I ordered and wouldnt be getting a refund My next step is filing a complaint with my credit card company
Hi there I was not happy at all with the service
When I rented the car everything was perfect people look after you with a smile on their faces they do not talk that much about the policies they do not even show you any scratch in the car the lady actually told me the car did not have a scratch but then when I checked I had to go back to her to let her know
Anyway 4 days later when I returned the car the guy very rude by the way came to us saying that the windscreen was a bit cracked with honestly a mark not even 10 big as the standard circle that the lady gives when hiring the car
So I want to know what is gonna happen with my 200 bond as no one really gave me a solution to my problem Instead they wanted me to pay 1000 as an insurance
Thanks
I booked two double superiors for a hotel through the website However I received a voucher for one double superior and one double which is much smaller but was shockingly charged for two double superiors I have called and emailed the customer support team with a screenshot of the booking I was making two double superiors confirming the price for each They dont seem to understand the error and how this is completely unacceptable The last email from the customer support team says there no are more double superiors avaliable which is a massive disappointment as we were going away for my mums 65th birthday but havent not acknowedged that I have been overcharged Signed off with the following which is an absolute joke
We have already sent your voucher by email
Thank you for using AMOMAcom and do not hesitate to call us back in order to make your reservations around the world
AMOMAcom wishes you an enjoyable stay
Would not recommend as I have spent so much time with customer support with no resolution
Since posting this I received the message from amoma below I tried the new email address to try and get this sorted but they replied with exactly the same response as previously telling me I have a voucher for a superior double and a normal double ending with AMOMAcom wishes you an enjoyable stay
Where is my upgrade or refund
The way the company operates is a joke Please do not waste your time
I booked a car rental only after the booking was I advised there is an additional fee of 1650 per day as a driver of 22 years of age
I bought a phone from apple website uk which was unlocked after getting my phone replaced as it had some batterie issues they have put a carrier sim lock on it it has now been 6 weeks that i am unable to ise my phone i have been in my local store 3 times and called apple care 56 times they keep telling me we will sort it out But nothing is happening after spending 620 pounds on this phone i dont expect this sort of service from apple i am so disappointed Literally disgusting customer service Its not even my fault that there is a lock on it its apples fault but they are not just sorting it out seems like its never going to work and apple is unable to solve the issue Disgusting
Our production company has owned an LS3650 for a couple years now with no problems except for some screws left out on the part that physically rides up and down on the screws and almost came apart And normal maintenance items
Our new Ls1630 was close to 3 months late Arrived with belts loose apparently and the xaxis out of square Hours spent on phone fix the issue only to have issues of not holding size pop up again Hopefully fixed for good now If not I will fix myself since most of the findings were on my end anyways
They are always pleasant to deal with but tend to ignore when you want spare parts
Would not purchase again
Horrible customer service I scheduled for the evening delivery the next day I DID NOT RECIEVE A CALL FOR AN ARRIVAL until 1240 AM WITH AN ARRIVAL AT 100 AM THE NEXT DAY AFTER THE EVENING SCHEDULED TIMEI WAS ASLEEP they expected me to wait up for a delivery until 1 am you are kidding me rightI was told repeatedly delivery was from 411pm They say they will call you in between about your delivery time and never did I had to call customer service the next day This delivery was drug out for 4 days I called the store and talked to a managaer He was rude and said they always run over on time and they would be back the next evening between 1130 and 130 am againI SAID thats crazyI asked for a refund and the manager said I have to call corporate and speak to them to get a check by mail I decided to scheduled for the early truck between 84pm i never got a call until 6pm and they delivered at 630pmWe recieved the chuna cabinet we ordered with a broken light bulb shattered all over the inside of it Between bickering with customer service showing up at 1 in the morning not coming the following day the next and waiting 4 days total for my supoosed delivery next day between 4 and 11 pm and recieving my cabinet with shattered glass inside never will I shop at a Gardner white In 2016 i ordered a kit hen table and OMGGG IT WAS A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE THEN TOO
Food never turned up called the restaurant who said EatNow never passed on the order Apparently the estimate delivery time EatNow send is just their assumption and not directly from the restaurant so never accurate Will NEVER use again Still waiting on a return phone call or email in relation to my refund for a paid dinner i didnt get
purchased item on line for a next tues delivery received email confirming that date mon night receive message that delivery will take place in 3 weeks wont happen again
Why is this company still in existence 
Recently made an order and a good while after the order hadnt arrived a had a very poor email from them telling me they could not fulfill my order  what is the point
Unfortunately my experience was poor It involved E mails and phone calls and a much longer wait than I anticipatedWhilst eveyone I spoke to was helpful it was still a messy experienceI was told that I would be contacted to arrange a suitable time for delivery The very large very heavy item arrived when no one was home I had to go to the sorting office to collect it and it took two of us a major struggle to lift it and a drive home with the boot door open  Disaster
Wrong product picture
Now I have to pay to return the product
In addition while conversing with Customer Service no effort to show me the correct product on the website was given
Looking back a poor service no extra mile gone to to rectify the issue
Its a bit crap tbh
I have not experienced worse customer service I ordered a general sized dress which turned out was too small for me I have now requested to return it 3 times Each time I get a general response this dress was made to measure which it wasnt and my initial order for the dress proves it or I get we can alter the dress which will take 23 months which isnt an option for me I told them this and then I got the first response again from them telling me this dress was made to order which makes no sense They just have generic responses to send to their customers which makes me feel like they just dont care about their customers Very disappointed that I received such poor customer service Returning a general sized dress should not be this difficult
My friend could not get the confirmation email to work We couldnt figure out how to make anything work I canceled my account and removed the app from my phone
Car came back worse with a charge of over 800 No customer care whatsoever 4 weeks of trying to resolve it and nothing from them Con artists
The company would not allow me to return the dress for a refund after a dozen emails Dress received did not look like the dress in the picture that was ordered
A LOT of candy was stale The 70s candy boxes I ordered had EXPIRED dates on them which explains the hard candy that was supposed to be soft I felt the advertisement of the box was misleading too For the price you get about 7 pieces of candy rip off I will never order again or refer
You market a price then to come on here and buy a gift for my wife Im to answer questions like Im a women and a man wouldnt be coming on here to purchase gifts Then you only accept the Quote d price by making me accept a stupid membership gimmick Good job hopefully I remember to cancel before I get charged for some random gifts
I bought a monster 2 template and these guys drove me up the pole
Their documentation is incorrect and the download link was also incorrect On chat they explained that they woudl give me a different download link for the template To make matters worse they gave me a configuration for the phpini file that did not allow their own template to be uploaded After several changes via the hosting partner bluehost also suggested by template monster as a partner funny they take 5 hours to answer a ticket
I finally used the web to figure out how to upload the template directly onto my new hosting service the new template was extracted and lo and behold it need plugins that just dont seem to get installed
When I contacted the chat channel on template monster Ivy informs me that I shoudl try reuploading the template manually and that the issue needs time Oops it is their policy to frustrate you for 36 hours so you can buy their installation package where they would not misguide themselves on the mess they create
When I asked for my money back they said they would arrange a call back in 3 hours Its 120 am in India and heshe expects me to be awake to listen to their garbage about how pathetic their service can get and can get worse
I recieved a dress that was damaged I contacted the company to see if I could exchange it but said they wont be possible since it was past the 24 hour damage notification eventhough I contacted them the next day when I opened my package Worst experience ever I was so disappointed in their customer service
Installation was at the house of an installer that wanted installation paid in cash in a not so nice personal garage There were multiple problems after with locking brake warning messages on my dash and the vehicle being locked in 4WD high The dealership said that the problems could not be fixed especially computer issues without bringing it into the shop The shop had it for two day and locked out the intoxalok which took 2 hours out of my day to have reset Problems have still not been corrected with vehicle that has to be taken in for possibly two more days that probably will involve another reset on restricted driving times I did not receive any manual or instructions to report when I am taking my vehicle in for maintenance If you dont ask every question whether you know it or not you could get yourself in hot water
It has been two weeks I have had my vehicle into the dealer trying to determine what the problem is they are not allowed to use the device to start the vehicle based on policy which would mean I would have to sit there all day the installerwhom I paid cash for the installationhas been unavailable or has not returned my calls and the intoxalock contact through this has been away for most of the issues Still continues to be a challenge with wires now visible under my dash that were not their before
They where not shipping my order so I had them cancel it and then they refused to refund my money
I booked 2 way flight from Ottawa To Edmonton website price was 1100
when I get the confirmation email it shows 1700 minutes later another email showing my credit card was declined i checked my account it shows that they charge me 600 i called the website and asked them what the hell is that answer was my credit card was declined my maximum on my credit is 1500 so its for sure it will be declined since you tried to charge me 1700 instead of he website price 1100 I have job interview with Alberta Sheriffs on march 3 at 1030 am so now i dont have enough money to book another flight and the refund will take 5 to 10 days to shows on my account My future depends on this interview now i have to figure a way to make it to Alberta
I will give no star if I can dont waist your money and time go directly to the airline website
Insurance with a reasonable excess costs as much as the car Car was fine though
Worst customer services I ever come across You better spend a few more dollar than deal with them Wish you luck
Money in an hour Its been 5 hours and Im still waiting Total and complete BS Try to stay away from them at all costs Id rather go somewhere pay a bit more but get more timely service Seeing that I needed the funds 4 hours ago FAIL
Great like always
Gamersgate has a decent catalogue to choose from and reasonable pricing on sale items however the one glaring omission from their business practice is the lack of a refund policy Many other merchants offer refunds but they do not hands down Once you click purchase no matter what happens too bad its your problem now Even if the purchase has serious issues with the product They still get their money and you dont get yours back Shop other merchants if you can youll be much better off
If you dont shop on the 1st of the month your size is gone When you do shop the 1st of the month your website cant support the volume
Great business to order from
I ordered a tshirt for my little bro week ago paid for the delivery and I still havent received it I called them yesterday to find out what happened and they still havent dispatched the item He was sooo excited and it is sad to see him asking every day where is my tshirt poor thing Im getting so frustrated with their service and not even picking up the phone for inquiries Ill never ever use their service again
Goldcar took 340 from our account without any notification contact to me a week after return Company claimed wrongly that I had damaged the front bumper
We had seen some damage to it on hiring refused the car Then the guy in Alicante took a photo said it was now on record and was all clear so off we went
Returned car without any scratches it was parked most of the week 3 weeks and I heard nothing but today saw that the money was removed from my account without my knowledge agreement or even notification
You seem to be Cowboys I will fight this

I called Saturday night to talk about how upset and disappointed I was in the food I ordered The person I spoke to was going to get back to me via email or phone Im still waiting Im also still waiting for a refund and apology from the restaurant whose attitude was disgraceful
I bought this on line and from this company because I needed to repair my sprinkler system quickly The company offered 2 day shipping for an 8 adder The order was placed on a Thursday The package was not received until 7 days later
I did not call to argue the point as it was only 8 dollars but will not be purchasing from here again
The part did arrive undamaged and well packed hence the 2 stars
When my delivery arrived the driver said one endtable was damaged so he didnt even bring it off the truck Then later that day I noticed one of the chairs was broken so I had to make arrangements to have it swapped out They brought the replace but failed to credit me for the returned endtable and they billed me for a third table It was extremely frustrating to have to prove to RC Wiley that they over billed me when I paid in full up front and never applied for credit When I called the billing department the lady that answered was unsympathetic and unhelpful RC Willey has quality problems with their furniture Not sure if they just buy junk or it gets broken in transit
Booked a home package pick up and was given a time between 105pm
The only 3 minutes I was busy on the toilet the TNT representative knocked and drove off Would have waited at the door for less than a minute as I opened the door to see him drive away
I contacted TNT to arrange a repickup and I was hung up because it was my fault and not of their concern I had to drop the package off myself to the Pack  Send depot so much for a pick up and deliver service and when discussing with the Pack  Send representative in Glenelg I was told you cant expect them to wait around all day while you wipe your butt Cannot write in the review the explicit words as says inappropriate language
Zero decency zero customer service
I paid for 23 days delivery Took 7 days and the delivery driver couldnt be bothered walking up a flight of stairs to the correct address so my sister with new born had to arrange to get it herself
Absolutely Appalled Would never do business with again or recommend
I was quite disappointed with my experience as my order arrived much later than stated and one item that i ordered was missing hasnt arrived still
The price however is excellent in almost all of the store
The ordered front fender for vespa 125gt was poorly made and did not fit properly on my scooter screw holes were in inaccurate places what lead to askew position of front fender
picked up hired car which was in fact really dangerous to drive called up to complain instead customer service put the phone down do not use this company really bad service
I bought a groupon for a photo blanket as a Christmas gift The estimated arrival date was well before Christmas but it didnt arrive for another month The blanket was super thing and cheap feeling and not really a blanket at all more like a sheet Certainly wont order from this site again
Still so frustrated Wont be ordering from them again
Ordered Dickies work trousers  nothing wrong with the product  Industrial Workwear do not make them just supply them Supply was very poor Charged 6 for standard UK delivery and it takes them over a week and three emails later for them to be delivered
Their argument is that they do not carry stock and have to order direct from Dickies then why am I bothering with them a store specialising in industrial workwear and yet do not carry stock
Might as well order from Amazon  at least delivery is more reliable
I have paid c EUR 91 to Euroflorist Austria www euroflorist at for two bouquets delivery by Innsbruck The size of the bouquets was literally incomparable to what I have ordered I have ordered beautiful good flowers and they have delivered very small poor appearance bouquets
I have emailed them with a request for a refund and provided a detailed explanation and images of what I have ordered and what I have received In response they refused to do any reasonable refund and just refunded EUR85 of service fee of EUR91 order Basically they simply fooled me and did not deliver what I have ordered I would not recommended anyone to use their service
The buying and finding he parts was rather easy But they sent the wrong parts I havent gotten a reply yet Looking to speak with someone soon to see if They will fix the issue will update after it gets resolved The shipping cost was ridiculous though

It took attempts with 5 companies to eventually obtain a completed contract One simply could not get the address correct even though the other 4 managed perfectly Of those 4 two were unable to complete the process online and so I moved on One requested a 400 deposit which is absurd and I fanally settled on one
I ordered a PS4 VR move controller pack before Christmas It arrived on time but needed to be returned This is where the company fails They took took too long to respond to my request to return the item meaning the product did not get returned within the return period Since returning the product weeks ago I have heard nothing They do not answer the phone or respond to emails Extremely dissatisfied and out of pocket to the tune of almost 100
Check out the hundreds of bad reviews on Trip advisor consumer affairs BBB and complaint board I booked a rental through Volotea for a car in Venice It that was handled by Cartrawler I got a confirmation booking number with the required documents to bring The credit card with which the booking was made my drivers license and the email that confirmed the booking The booking was made with locauto I brought all the required documents to the rental pick up desk and they refused to rent the car without a second credit card and they did not take debit Visa card I was never told that I needed a second credit card and also that I could not use a debit visa card Car trawler did not mind the Debit Visa card since they had charged me already I could not get the car I called car trawler and refused to cancel my booking or reimburse me fully for my rental I had to book the car directly with Locauto which was almost 100 cheaper Until now Cartrawler has refused to reimburse the rental car and they have refused communication despite several emails
They said that it would be send from Europe When the packed came it was from China And I had to pay tax 28 and my packed was 16 never gonna buy from that mendacious company again
Got an irritated contact lens pair of bausch and lomb and getting irritated every single day I will never buy anything from lenskart seems like it is second hand pair of contact lenses  my 2000 rs is totally wasted They give me compensation of 300 rs against my 2000 Rs WHICH is still not loaded in my account LOL
I will suggest you guys to Never buy anything from Lenskart  They do not care for the most important body part  they just do their business at first they will provide you original and they after gaining your trust they back stab you with bad quality products
I contacted Customer Service asking for a price match or I would return the product as I just ordered But got no reply from them its been 45 days I got a reply from SSENSE trustpilot review to contact customer service which I did first place

Thanks again for using my name when a screen name was asked for I would have needed you to pay for the NEW title plates  since I handed them to Motor Vehicles and also 2 registrations and time at NJMV
Bottom line is that  If you cant handle the criticism DONT ASK FOR A REVIEW and send back BS replies The deal is done and leave it at that Would have been easier at a salvage yard a few dollars less no pissing match I DIONT WANT ANY MORE CORRISPONANCE WITH YOU OR THE COMPANY
Additional Info
First Kevin wasnt there when the car was sold only the associate So hes talking about what the company program is Also he or a rep called me asking me to change my review Did he state that NO He must have been online since the sales person had to send emails test message to get any answers for every question and concerns
Bill or Sale  Title all the same to me All Im saying is that as far as Im concerned All the papers that they wanted me to sign was after I signed off on the car on the title  bill of sale OK
In the past when selling a car in NJ as the seller I need to show I own the car letter once the loan company  bank etc showing that the car is mine  Next odometer reading is correct and day of sale and sign off The buyer now OWNS that car no paper work except check or cash to me Not all paperwork for me to sign if the buyer loses the title  bill of sale
Once again not giving me a chance to explain my side But I just got around the system
I did not receive any Quote s wsste of time
This was my first order with this company so I am completely disappointed
Firstly it is clearly counterfeit I have bought enough PS4 games to know that they are sealed in official Playstation wrapping This has clearly been shrinkwrapped by some dodgy individual
The cover is also clearly a photocopy

Drivetime and Aeverex sent me to 3 different repair shops over the last week just to find out my car which Ive had for less than 6 months has 1200 in repair And guess what  not a single dime of it is covered It should be noted within 2 weeks of getting the car there was OVER 600 dollars worth of repairs The Buick repair shop told me there was no possible way this car was checked prior to selling They came out and said I was screwed I now pay OVER 500 a month on the car plus 120 on full insurance which is required by Drivetime to have a car that doesnt work Didnt even get to enjoy the car for a full 6 months
Stop pestering me
When I returned a flag in exchange for a larger flag and a pole I was told that my credit card would not go through The lady suggested that I call the card carrier I told her that I would call the carrier and then call her right back When I spoke with American Express Rep she said that my card was active and there should be no problem She also stated that there was no evidence on their side that any attempt to place a charge had occurred When I called back just a few minutes later and spoke with the American Flag rep she said that the order was cancelled She said that they would credit my card If the charge didnt go through then how were they able to put the credit through Will not deal with this company again

After waiting nearly two months for the mirror I ordered to be installed when the install was complete I ended up with a mirror that has a half inch strip right in the middle The installers did tell me that they would have to cut the mirror to get it up the stairs which may have been easier but not entirely necessary Nonetheless I was told it would be put on the wall together accepting that there would be a seam I accepted the plan When I came up to see the finished product I was upset to see a 14 to 12 inch strip right up the middle of the mirror It literally looks like two separate mirrors on the wall right in the middle of course where you would naturally stand to do your workout When I addressed the concern I was told it could be taken down but the wall is damaged and that will be mine to fix I pressed for some resolution and was told again that after contacting the owner there is nothing we can do but we can take it down and leave your wall damaged And so I am left very disappointed and completely dissatisfied I plan on reaching out to the company to again try for some resolution Hopefully something can be done
do not like feel uneasy about it
I made 1 order with Tomtop in February 10 which have not arrived yet in Greece even though it says dispatched on February 11 I tried to track my package and I found out that since 225 it have been in Germany Customer service keeps ignoring my 45 emails Overall I think that this company is an utterly fraud that stole my money The fun part of it is that they keep sending me new product notifications
Pretty much the only good thing abit the delivery service was that it took 3 days The box was damaged and wet the shoes were slightly squashed and damp and also had some mud on the soles
i was very surprised when receiving my parcel  it was just stuffed into a box with no wrapping tissue or anything very surprised especially for a store that stocks brands of very high value

All I got to do was select that I wanted a CITY VIEW BUT I want more than just a view I want to know WHAT is in the room I just reserved I would have also liked to know IF I could use my AAA discount But I got nothing
After I made this post they contacted me and told me that AAA is not available at this hotel OR it would have been offered it would have been available to me reserving this way The other thing they told me is that IF I wanted a specific type of room I needed to contact the hotel the day of or day before to see IF it would be available Im still not happy BECAUSE having a type of room is what MOST hotels offer WHEN making the reservation Im still not satisfied

After I sent in my books they said that they wouldnt give me any money at all for one of them because it was in rough condition even though it was a book I ended up not using for a class I had taken and had touched a total of two times When I further inquired about what kind of rough condition it was in I was given a non specific generalized response and all but ignored Also they advertise how quick they can give you money for selling your books but it took them over a MONTH to send me the check for the books they did accept Overall they had terrible customer service and seemed more like a scam than anything else

I was asked to review my experience regarding an easy keys order that I had recently placed so thats exactly what I am doing I would probably have given a good review if they asked for it after I have received the product But since I dont have the product I ordered yet I cant give a good review at this point in time In the future please ask for feedback after your products have been delivered
3 months of waiting with no status updates Spoke to call center with no additional information provided Extremely frustrated Would never recommend this service Invest in more lab techs if you want to growhandle current business load Very poor customer service is not beneficial to any company
I ordered my glasses two pair exact with express shipment three days later I checked the status to be told that it will take time due to my specialty lens Completely understandable
However  Almost two weeks now has gone by with my shipment order stating a delivered status I have not received my glasses to understand that it has been delivered I called two days ago 022017 to speak to a automated system seems speaking to an actual human for customer service is impossible I also sent an email with no response Here I am frustrated with good money spent and no package in sight There are no actual people to speak to only some automated system Status says delivered but no confirmation to what address or time I am patiently waiting for a response I want a refund and to be through with firmoo Do yourself a favor and skip over this website no matter how many cheesy offers and specials they present Some foreign companywebsite that is money hungry with bad business
Apparently couldnt unlock iCloud account due to device being lost or stolen Its not lost or stolen No Terms and Conditions to be seen anywhere during checkout but they crop up after they apparently cant unlock your device and offer you a useless voucher that cant even be used for another unlock Website says 100 money back guarantee too they only give money back if you have proof of purchase and if I had that I could go to Apple for free to unlock my device instead of paying a third party 40 iPhoneIMEI reported my review to have it removed Just look at the banner at the top of the page if in doubt dont be fooled

The food hadnt arrived 25 minutes after the scheduled delivery and a subsequent phone call to the supplier revealed that they had a problem with the order No phone call was made to let us know there was an issue with the order or that it would be late We then had to pay again direct to the vendor themselves Very disappointing service although the food was great I wouldnt use the app again instead Id rather just go straight to the vendor
I had to talk a rather abrupt telephone operator who was in a hurry Otherwise OK experience
Booked a city break in the morning for the same weekend the price Quote d increased upon payment page Paid anyway
The money was taken out of my account however no tickets recieved for the entire day Had to chase them up and the indian call centre employee did not have an idea and told to ring back next day I was issued an ATOL certificate
Waited till 10am and had no patience to wait any further an rang the call centre They informed me that the booking has to be amended as they did not book the flights and hotel was booked They told me I would have had to pay extra for new bookings however after searching there was none on offer
In the end had to cancel booking and awaiting refund Thanks for screwing up my friends birthday surprise due to your sheer incompetence Do not use these cowboys
I was given a conformation number and all On my way to the storage with all my house items ready to store I call them to let them know I was on my way Disappointed to here oh yeah I seen that we dont have that available  What the hell Why not call or email me the minute you notice it was not available
I ordered this on February 14th Apparently there was an issue When I called the people on the phone were less than helpful and somewhat rude The answer I was given was Oh the card didnt work I guess you have to order it again
I called my bank and according to them that evening February 13th they had approved the transaction I did not get an email from BH until the next day telling me the order had been canceled So now I had to order again The cost has since gone up Granted I have only lost 20 dollars but still It is irritating Im frustrated that I wasnt notified when it happened so I could have fixed the situation and Im frustrated with how the staff handled it
Used this service while I loved overseas for work Its cost effective and they were exactly correct with pick up and drop off times I would say that you will need to consider that you are likely to not be a professional removalist or packer and while you might think everything is secure the second they bring the forklift to pick up the box and load it on to the truck you are in trouble New fridge covered in dints from the fork light bouncing around as it was putting the box in Also cover everything It got really dusty inside the box
good price right quantities but print quality leaves someething to be desired
As long as one posts cats food and clothing they are OK Once you try to collect stuff about anything controversial  you do not belong They just remove your pins and boards

Absolutely disgusted with the conduct of this company and would advise everyone against using their service
We were provided with a Quote which was then changed after we accepted it After back and forth Get Transfer owned their mistake and notified that they would stand by their original Quote 
After this already stressful backandforth the transfer NEVER ARRIVED
This caused us to miss 2 flights which we will now be seeking reimbursement for
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY They will scam you and cause nothing but stress and anguish
I was not happy with the cost and the lack of customer service I received I purchased a cake server set a month ago and returned to have it engraved The sales person was very pushy and insisted that I put certain things on the engraving to find out that the cost was going to be outrageous and way more than I was willing to pay This seemed to annoy her when I said NO I wanted Quote s for different engraving Her comment to me was weddings are expensive Then she had the gull to Quote me a price for some scrolling that I even confirmed before I left it with them Then she was rushing me to pay When I picked it up she had priced it double what she had told me She seemed to be gone when I came back to pick it up and the other sales person was no help and could of cared less The whole experience has made me realize that I will never return there to purchase or have any engraving done My motto is word of mouth and if this company thinks this is the way to treat their paying customers then I will go elsewhere
Customer service was quick to respond to queries however did not rectify the issue The advertised Windscreen sunshades Sun Sreen Interior XL WS40XL and the product packaging were different and hence received an item that was not expected
The website is still advertising two very different pictures for the item

After having booked a car with drop off at a different location which was clearly chosen in the rental conditions I received a certain good price Everything seemed fine and it was clearly stated where the car would be picked up and dropped off and what the price was After this I received an email from rentalcarscom stating that I would need to pay an additional 200 for the different location If that was immediately stated I wouldnt have chosen their offer So its a ripoff they give a good price upfront and then ask for additional fees later After stating I was unwilling to pay the additional 200 booking was cancelled without any explanation or any email
ordered and received my package in a timely manner in January Before it arrived I changed my mind and decided to refuse it Called to see about my refund and one person tells me they have recieved one says they havent been on hold for 10 mins poor customer service in this sutuation
Bad experience Will not recommend site to others based on ordering snafu and then the lack of customer service to rectify the situation
I was very disappointed when I receive my shipment for free 4 x 6 flyers from this company they charge me 20 to ship only 100 flyers I was expecting 500 flyers and did not realize there were only going to be 100 never again very dissatisfied
Today I received an offer in the mail to Post Jobs for Free with a code I was given Dont fall for this Its not FREE Its just like ordering face cream free trial on line They require a credit card just to validate the business but theyll charge that card in 4 days if you dont call them back to cancel Dont fall for any ZipRecruiter offer to Post Jobs for FREE Its not FREE
rude staff on the phone wish amazon did not use them
I booked 3 car rentals through this site The price was less than other sites The problem is the online form allows you to put where you want to pick up and drop off the vehicle then all your information including payment It does not stop you if the pick updrop off site is not available So you pay get your confirmation that has a different pick updrop off site that was populated by the site without you knowing When you try to cancel you are told there is a fee and if within a certain time frame you will have to pay the entire rental amount Usually sites will pause processing if there is a discrepancy along the way Will not use the site again and sharing this so others can be cautious
I have the flex package and I was suppose to get my local channels free but you are charging me 1000 for it that means you are breaking our contract I can cancel and send all the equipment back with no charge I will do that if you do not correct my flex pack with local channels
The followup call to an international flight purchase was belabored and very unprofessional I was placed on hold several times once over 10 minutes and the agent I spoke with seemed confused about the whole verification process After conferencing in a representative from my credit card company I was also asked to provide a copy of my ID to verify the purchase After I refused to do so the agent spoke with his manager and said that that step was not necessary This especially gave me very little confidence in this business and I would not use their services again
Competitive prices but at a cost poor customer service and very difficult to get in contact with the company for queries ect Also unnecessary emails and letters sent regarding the policy
On May 2016 I sold tickets for the World cup of Hockey using this company But still didnt get my money back
Got emails with bank slips only But still no money
I even provided the official letter from my bank that there werent any money on my bank account But ticketbis ignored this fact Sent bank slip and now I dont have any answers They make poker face and dont wanna to take care of their clients dont wanna to perform their duties they declare
Broken cases and screw driver missing
I have not received the goods I paid the money Now I do not have the goods and I did not return the money  very bad

My credit card company replaced my credit card once Ive complained about this fraudulent service They told me that Nochex in collaboration with this website were reported by more than 10 000 customers
Ive been having trouble with this car since I purchased it Lesson learned The financing is terrible and the payments are exorbitant and I am currently looking to just trade it in somewhere that will treat me fair and not sell a car that they would not purchase themselves
Brown petals as soon as out of box no message in with flowers as blank card but told you to write Happy 4 year Marriage Anniversary my Wife which my wife was disappointed and told me off Such a unexceptable conduct I will not buy from FloraQueen again ever
Check in location confusing Parking spaces unlabeled a rude note was left on my car and was threatened the police would be called on me Rude check in personnel Incorrect information on key check outs were written down leading to confusing check out No response when I needed to check in early and call center unable and unwilling to connect me directly to staff at the place
Just received an order of which I was totally unaware I dont think I placed the order and no email was received that let me know it was on the way so I could cancel

They hide that they are dropshipping from China That way the reciever in western countries will have to pay the double price Sucks dont use it use Amazon
Ordered off Justeatie and there was a hair in my food The beef was not beef and the chicken was slimy and also questionable as to wherewhat it came from
When I relayed my complaint to the customer service team I was met with hostility and arroganceThey advised that the food supplied on their website was not their responsibility and that I would have to register my complaint with the IFSA I pushed back as I was their customer and not interested in registering a complaint I simply wanted a simple refund for the food I paid for that I could not eat
I eventually got a refund for the dish that had human hair in it but they have still refused to tell me where the beef was sourced and when I questioned what they would offer for the fact the I was left with no edible food and hungry that evening they replied that the restaurant had refunded the chicken dish as a gesture of goodwill
They clearly take no responsibility for the restaurants on their website as there was no offer of a refund on the other dish that tasted like fish when it was supposed to be beef the driver fee or even a courteous voucher to apologise for the inconvenience
Absolutely socking service from a reputable company They clearly need to vet their suppliers more and brush up on their customer service
Still have not reached a resolution and they are now not responding to my emails
The bouquet I ordered is called Burst Of Happiness  medium sizehowever the flowers that was received were absolutely nothing like the flowers that were ordered while I appreciate some flowers are seasonal  not available this was completely different in colour  flowers also not as many flowers a lot of greenery  I was very disappointed when I saw a photograph of the flowers received  for this reason I will not use Euroflorist again 
I ordered some invitation cards and the pic I choice came a lot darker on the actual cards and it was hard to make out one of the faces in one of the photos displayed on the invitationso it wasnt a true reflection of what the preview showed then what I got as the final product A bit of a let down  Had no choice but to distribute the invitation without making out the faces

Just pray NOTHING in your order needs to be changed My experience ordered two items but was later told that one is not available and I have three days to make modifications to my order I asked them to cancel the whole order because of the shipping cost but instead of cancellation they immediately shipped the remaining part of the order When confronted about it they said that the items get shipped automatically and there is nothing they can do about it and that they would not refund the shipping
Awful food on 15 hours waiting cold soggy awful should be closed down rotten rang them the guy was rude obnoxious  didnt even try  be apologetic nit about the money just awful experience please do not order from here we threw it all in the bin
your whole system is to intrusive too much information asked for just to compare prices Will never use system again until you change
Customer service is horrible Ive been waiting 4 weeks for a check I was supposed to get within 34 days Never again am I using this website
I hired a Goldcar through DoyouSpaincom and collected it from Lanzarote airport Goldcar agent there wanted to sell me damage excess insurance as I hire cars often I have an annual policy I would guess the agents are on commission as she was pretty abrupt with me Asked if I was covered if someone smashed the car windows Couldnt properly examine the car at the airport garage as it was quite dim in there and the cars are tightly parked However next morning I did examine there were a few minor dents not shown on the car check out diagram but worst of all one of the front tyres was 50 bald and the rubber showed signs of perishing Wasted half a days holiday in taking it back and getting another  no apology
Their fuel policy is another rip off I paid 2490 on collection for a full tank of petrol and returned the car with half a tank I was given a refund but charged for them to fill the car up again a nett extra of 20 Eur
I have written several times to complain but all I get is their customer service standard letter saying how wonderful their service is
I didnt know a company so big would have such bad customer service and make such wrong decisions and not be accountable for it stay away from PayPal the worst company Ive ever come across BEWARE

poor selection
The ink cartridges we ordered either did not work or stopped working shortly after installation This has happened on several different orders I request money back for two PG 240XL ink cartridges including shipping Not pleased with your product Thank You
A lot of things I liked were sold out or in the wrong size color and I dont like that you have to obligate yourself to the membership to place a sale order
Delivered furniture and it was broken Had to wait for a another delivery time No compensation at all
I havent drank alcohol in over a year and I take precautions not to have anything in my car that may leave alcohol particles in the air yet Ive failed rolling retests multiple times only to pass them on the next test Intoxalock has charged me just over 8000 for every false fail and Ive had to request hearings with the DMV to not have an additional year tacked onto my lease I feel like this company wants to bleed me dry financially and Im very unhappy with the service I know I messed up and had to get the device but Im trying to turn things around and this device is making me feel like Im running backwards uphill
 update I was contacted by an intoxalock representative and was reimbursed for a lockout fee That has definitely made me feel better about their overall customer service but Im still in the same boat regarding my situation with the DMV and the intoxalock device false failing me multiple times
ou may have to pay customs duties and taxes for shipping personal goods or  and taxes are most typically not included in the price of the goods you purchase
This is another way of scam people
I ordered 4 games at the beginning on January and paid the 199 extra to have the item delivered by Hermes as this is what they recommend on their website at checkout On 13th January my order status changed to delivered when in fact it has not been delivered
I sent them many emails and all they said was the item was delivered when in fact it hadnt been delivered I got fed up and phoned them They told me they need to chase it up with Hermes and will get back to me within 2448 hours Nobody got back to me so I contacted them again A week later I called them again and they told me the item had been delivered at the wrong address The gentleman I spoke to said he would get back to me within 24 to 48 hours to inform me whether they would issue me a refund or send me a replacement item Three weeks later after that phone call and 5 emails later nobody got back to me
So I phoned them today and the lady we spoke to said she will get her manager to call us back within 3045 minutes to have a refund issues No phone call back so after 15 hours we called them back This time the gentleman that answered Connor said that Karl the manager is not at his desk and he does not know where he is and also told me they cant issue me a refund because the items had been delivered How is that if a few weeks ago they told me they delivered it to the wrong address It seems that now it is nowhere on their record that the items had been delivered at the wrong address
Karl Westerside if youre reading this we are still waiting for your call back I will continue to write to you and to the Gameseek CEO until I receive my refund
This is frustrating as I have ordered from Gameseek many times in the past with no issues But this time around the company wants to be washing their hands off any responsibility Shame on you
We are disappointed in the time taken to despach our order Confirmation that Endoca had this order 2X1500gm CBD oil was received March 13 Order was paid for on that date We received notification on March 17 that our order had just been despatched This delay is hurtful as we are trying this product for serious physical difficulties
When Illness or injury prevents travel to area one has purchased Groupons and customer has Drs note to prove it it is alarming to me that Groupon will not allow trade to Groupon Bucks so customer can get value paid After years of using Groupon and recommending it to family and friends I will no longer be using Groupon
not a lot of inventory
Pretty much as it says in the title Mailed to say pieces in the game were broken which happens and is totally fair enough very slow responses and then just    nothing Very disappointing
So I was on formspringspring me a very long time ago the ask questions by you friends part and apparently you find it acceptable to take my details and put me onto you dating site and put me Down as single and looking in London I dont even live there without my knowledge I just happened to look in my spam folder and found you kept sending me emails I thought it was spam but then decided to check it out because of the Number of emails I was receiving do you think it unethical to take thousands of QA site users sign them up to a dating site  send their details to each other I feel its disgusting and that people should receive a email asking if they would like to be moved i have now deleted my account
Concerned someone has stolen my identity because I did not rent a car No reference info from you so wasting my day trying to figure out what is going on Called local Verc only to get answering machine Can someone contact me please This is crazy
They have no phone
Then it depends on who you talk to on the chat If its someone with an attitude no real knowledge repeating the same phrase etc
For many issues that overwhelm the average chat service person you are referred to send a mail to sales or other part of the company and of course most are left unanswered
They have an automatic renewal policy and adding money on the bill if you did not receive the mail like it was in my case since it was bought for a client Then they add more and more fees
I had 8 domains with them and their lack of flexibility and attitude once I realized a domain I never used got AUTOMATICALLY renewed and was charged a reminders fee made me cancel all of them after their lack of understanding and having a condescending attitude about it After many mails they agreed to take the reminders fee out  around 100kr and left another 130 kr or so for me to pay but they did not cancel the renewed subscription although I told them the money could stay with them and be used towards my existing domains
The way I was talked to was off putting I ended up not paying it  I forgot and from 130 kr or so it became 650 in 2 months But the catch is I did not know ITS NOT SHOWN on the dashboard of the site and I found out by accident when I asked their chat service And no I received no mails The debt company got my old adress from them so if I had not asked I would never had known BUT here is what gets to me there was a red link on the dashboardasking you to renew your domain once you said ADIOS drawing attention Why is there not a red link to say something is happening with your bill and give you a chance to fix it I never planned to renew or delay my payment but ended up being in the wrong treated as a bad payer because of the way things are divided between mail only notifications  which you can miss and dashboard creating a dependency and in my case a huge problem

I guess adding fees and putting me through all that legally they are in their right I should have been more careful less trusting taking care of my interests  hovering over my junk mail read the totality of their mails to the fine print but to me its no healthy way to do business And I frankly can not do that I have no time Mistakes happen I take responsibility for mine But their attitude towards the problem that happened was off putting
If the client is brought to FEEL irrelevant Stupid and used just a wallet than the SERVICE is bad
The company seems to lack the understanding of who their clients are people like me who are not web designers and probably not very acquainted with computers searching for simplicity To stop the automatic renewal of a domain we need to ASK them and get a link that expires in 24 hours WHY Why ask them why expiring This is a website tool service why is it failing to provide ALL the autonomy to the client and give him all the info he needs on his dashboard Little detail my dahsboard still shows 134 kr and not 630 Just sayingWhat would have happened if I had found out 6 months from now
Its all a mess
I found the experience to be extremely time consuming frustrating which defeats the purpose to go to a ready to go wbsite builder tool As a user I feel I am depending on their good grace for the important stuff and my autonomy is partial So all in all the whole experience was very frustrating and sad
The fact they want to respond or have reported peoples opinions in here to do damage control is even sadder
Ps I still have an active domain with them due to the fact that I did not find the time to start over and take it somewhere else But I will be leaving them completely after the expiration dates as I have stopped the other 8 domains I had
Not at all satisfied Ordered an android tv set top box months ago and never received it Multiple efforts to get Tomtop to resolve the problem have not been answered Extremely poor service Customer service does not exist at Tomtop
Booked flights but booking did not go through then 100 more expensive when I went to rebook
 Deceptive PS warranty that really has little value to receive warranty service you must ship 100 lb machine both ways at your own expense and wait 1 month in line They will not replace individual parts even under warranty if you take to your own local service center or fix yourself
 Only posts positive reviews of their products Any mention of parts failing under warranty disqualifies review from being posted
I contacted Groupon to cancel my Winter Wonderland The timing was bad as I received news from the doctor that I have breast cancer with complications that prevented me from traveling 300miles I buy constantly from Groupon and would have expected good service from them

I booked a hotel with Agoda with my card for someone else I paid it with my card and mentioned my family persons email address on it who is actually going to stay at the hotel There were issue with the payment and we were trying different cards to pay Agoda My family member did not stay at the hotel for the amount I paid and the hotel was agreed to refund to Agoda Agoda never refunded back since Nov 2016 I had emailed them multiple times and they always came up with an excuse and holding my money illegally I would not recommend Agoda to anyone Its very annoying when they say your name is not on the booking Idiots I paid it with my credit card that has my name so stupid excuses that hard to believe and that proves they do not want to refund the money so Im going to my bank and apply charge back to recover my money
When it comes to students going to school at Allen School they are charging an outrageous price they are printing out parts of books for the associates degree charging the students of Fortune only teaching the bare minimum of what we need to know to get associates degree I have gotten my certificate for medical billing and coding I also am going for an associates degree which I truly regret signing up for After all that Ive seen we are in our third module we only have five modules for the associates degree Im wondering now as I think about it do they really care whether we get a job or not Most of us are low income we are trying to better yourself by getting in debt up to our necks Most of us are close to 60 years old Why cant these people at the Allen School be honest with us And tell us that we are probably too old to get a job Then we have to get certified thats more money period we are just racking up student loan after loan that we will probably spend the rest of our lives trying to pay off But thats okay because no one was really honest with us at the beginning I know students that have taken and gotten their certificate for medical billing and coding But well never the able to get a CPC certification so thats money were paying on for nothing I also learned that one of the instructors has been fired in the Mist of her husband passing away The professor was told that she had missed too many classes period have a heart people As I see it this moment I believe that Allen School is heartless Thats just my opinion no one elses just mine You wanted me too tell the truth So there it is I will never recommend anyone to attend Allen School of health and science I feel that most of us were taken advantage of I will always feel that way So thats my opinion hope you enjoy it and I know you wont print it even though you say you will Ill be waiting to read my opinion on your website have a great day get a conscience God bless

My husband and I purchased a headboard wstorage for a king size bed and a coffee table last Sunday 319 at the Auburn Hills store We took the coffee table home with us and then my husband picked up the headboard last Wednesday We opened the boxes and found the side rails were missing along with the hardware My husband called our sales person Abe PItts and told him about it which he was supposed to call back in 10 minutes After having to go out of town for a wedding my husband called him today Sunday 326 to see what was going on and we just wanted to pick up the missing pieces We were told we had to bring it all back and exchange it My husband said if we had to pack it all up then we were going to return it Abe talked to the manager and said we had to bring it all back we could not just pick up the missing pieces My husband went to the store and talked to the manager Dave who said he could not open a box and give us the missing pieces even though that is what they gave us We are very unhappy with the lack of customer service I felt we were being Inconvenienced only because of the poor management of their warehouse In any case they have definitely lost a customer for life and we will make sure to let our friends and family know about our experience
While the product was good the delivery service was very poor I paid for standard delivery and it took 6 days to deliver instead of two There was a query over the address but nobody contacted me Instead I had to phone up Physio Room myself I said that if it was no delivered on the Friday to cancel the order I was out the following day and my husband found it put behind a pot at the front of the house Hermes were the delivery company and as Royal Mail and DPD have no problem delivering I was not impressed

I tried to change over my policy online today as my husband was at the garage to collect my new car The site would not recognise the reg and when I put it in manually and answered all questions and clicked the final button my policy did not update I tried several times and am now very stressed and 34 weeks pregnant The phone number gave me various options to pick over at least 5 mins before telling me itwasnt an option to get through but I could request a call back Call back took an hour and a half Not at all acceptable and I am regretting my decision to leave my old provider for the sake of a couple of Euro and seriously thinking of using my cooking off period option
I did not receive what I ordered My order was for frames and prescription lenses I only received the frames No prescription lenses were included When I called customer service I was told this never happens and I had to send them pictures Very disappointing

When I went to order a shirt and bra I was shown the intro price but was charged full price I could not get it to fix it even though this was my first purchase Really frustrated with the whole experience
Was charged 7999 from this company even though I had never heard of them or used any kind of unlock service It was refunded into my account 3 days later during which time I was unable to reach a customer service agent  they have no phone number listed on their website All I ever received was a generic email and when I responded and demanded a phone number so I could talk to a REAL person about the fact that they had my bank account information they waited three days and sent another generic email and said they would look over my case I sent another angry reply 2 days ago and said that if they were a real company there should be a phone number to call Still havent heard back Very skeptical of the legality of this company At the very least they have TERRIBLE customer service
Delivery on product was 67 weekstoo long
Although communication is good they stated that my book was a teachers guide when in fact it was not It had the capabilities of having teachers review in an online program The ISBN matched perfectly and that is not the case in the teachers edition of the book I think they used a lame excuse to not have to pay me It was o lay 7 And some change but Im sure they sold it for more than that since it was the actual text book Beware if you sell your books with this company
In the past your service was slow but OK
Now it is ridiculously slow
Dear All
Whoever are planning to go on holiday I advise you not to use lastminutecom to book a holiday at all It will ruin all your holiday I am 100 sure about it We had very very very bad experience I can not expressexplain my frustration in words Such a bad customer services We have booked everything last week to go to Rome Italy and we have received the confirmation saying that everything has been booked But all of a sudden the day before travel I have received the confirmation saying that the hotel was over booked so we have to transfer you to another hotel But we have booked 4 star accommodation and they have provided us with 3 star accommodation We said we will not be happy to go with it as we need up gradation or similar to 4 star or compensation I have been calling customer services since 1 pm and the last call I made was at 1050 pm and it has been discussed with many people during that 10 hour period and no one could resolve the issueWe were not sure whether we need to make travel arrangements or wait till they get back to us On the day we were supposed to travel we havent still heard anything from the customer services We got up in the early morning to contact the customer services and we have been told that they will contact us in 15 mins They keep on telling us the same thing but never contacted They say someone will call you to give update But not even a single person has contacted us to give any update its me who has been chasing them I felt like I have paid the money to buy this bad experiencestress ill health and not to go on holiday I have been chasing them every 15 mins as I am not sure if it will be resolved before going to airport I was in dilemma should I go to airport or stay at home Myself and my husband have booked our holidays at work changed currency at bank booked airport parking we were all ready to go on holiday but the hotel accommodation issue has not been resolved yet Such a rubbish customer services the people were talking from abroad and they were very very rude when we express our frustration They did not take any responsibility at all which ruined my holiday My wife had high blood pressure issue as she was in lot of tension due to the accommodation issue and the customer services behaviour She became sick even before we went on holiday and I have to take her to GP on the day of travelling just to make sure that she will not fall sick on holiday again The amount of distress frustration and the impact on our personal health caused by lastminutecom can not be expressed in words Only the person who experienced this knows the pain I am victim of this rubbish customer service So I strongly advise you not to use lastminutecom to book your holiday
First I paid with amazon but I got email that it is refused
Next I paid with my credit card
After that I got two mails of purchase At that time I cannot cancel one because they didnt give order information The site was not working properly
I asked using mail to refund one of them Still I cannot access the order information so I have to send a mail
And they said it is not their fault so I have to pay for send back one of the item So I had to pay additional 50 Is it really not their fault
It was terrible experience
I booked with Intrepid travel for a Machu Picchu trek opting for the Quarry trail which was billed as an alternative route to MP What rubbish It was a 3 day hike in the Andes starting and finishing at the same village followed by a trainbus trip to MP
I paid extra for a single supplement and then still had to pay extra for a sleeping bag  why was that not included in the accomodation charge
Id also paid extra for a transfer back to airport However the hotel Intrepid put me in knew nothing about the airport transfer An email from Interpid told me it was up to me to track this down
Totally deceptive and unethical behaviour on behalf of Interpid
I will NEVER travel with them again
The last case wouldnt charge So I bought a new case I have had this for about a month If I dont type super hard the keys do not type

Everyone needs to be careful when purchasing airline tickets as additional products get tacked on without proper notice or the ability to delight them from your final purchase Somehow I managed to purchase travel insurance not cancellation insurance and Im now in a fight with the Insurance Company to get the policy cancelled and recover the money that was charged to my credit card
I also complained about this to FlightHub and there was absolutely no response
It is the worst place to buy furniture and mattresses there They never notified me that it was going to be a late delivery So after one month no sofa and love seat
most of website is free shipping above 100
Would not touch them ever again
Will never use them again
Look theyre as cheap as they come and perfect if you just use your car for popping down to the shops and going to the gym But if you drive normal routes forget about it They significantly restrict you on how far you can travel and charge very high rates if you exceed it And you cannot contact them by telephone which is very frustrating They provide an unreliable call back service that if they do call you back on if itll be hours later And if you attempt to make the slightest change or alteration to the policy forget about it Its not possible or it costs you a fortune They are the Ryanair of car insurance
After having to return item at my cost I had to chase them for my money back which ended up being given in two parts  another additional cost as PayPal charged me for the second part of refund bad service avoid at all costs

Your comment and support regarding about BAFree Meals is misplaced BAdoes not give Free Meals the meals are paid for within the fare structure they are inclusive meals and have been so since day one
Your assertion that passengers do not expect bus and trains to include meals is because they have always charged the lowest fares possible for mass transport and as such have never included meals therefore the expectation of a free meal on a bus or train does not arise
Please fight your clients corner fairly not on a false premise

Short form Brazilian underwriter Zurich have noexisting customer service and cant seem to receive normal emails with PDFs They cant even read a normal PDF or so they say They also want the original documentation sent by surface mail to Brazil from abroad Everyone who has knowledge of Brazil knows that there is about a 50 chance that those documents will never make it unless you shell out 100 USD for a DHLFedex package And if the paperwork arrive it will take about 23 months to get there We have not yet received enough information to even send the papers yet after 3 months Paying much more for the Worldnomadscom service is worth if you can claim online and the underwriter is reliable but Zurich Brazil is a joke We contacted Worldnomads for help but they do not reply
Long version A copy of the email we sent to Worldnomads
Hi World Nomads
I have a complaint We feel fooled by the product you have sold us and I understand that we are not the only ones given that you instead of receiving questions from Brazilian nationals to your email address have chosen to instead give the email address to your insurance partner Zurich in Brazil They do a really terrible job
We have now tried for several months to present a claim to them but the communication is impossible they claim they havent received emails even when they have already answered them and proven they have received them They claim that perfectly fine PDF files are not readable and filled in with the data I can see on our own computers they send us canned email replies that do not at all correspond to our claim and they do not keep their promises to send us info when we have talked to them many times by phone
So what to do now Contact Zurich in Switzerland Can you help We are out travelling and dont have time for bureacraZy the Brazilian way
Policy redacted  Issued 14 Oct 2016 218 AM BRT Holder redacted
The price was well over 700 euros so we kind of expected some value
Policy holder name does not have a bank account in Brazil so she cant receive the refund and does not have any documents of residence in her name in Brazil which they seem to require Zurich creates all kinds of hurdles for us along the way in order to try to not refund to the person who paid the medical expenses in her name We have filled in all the paperwork including an authorization to have the refund sent to my account and emailed it to them three times 
They claim that we should send the originals by postal mail but postal mail to Brazil takes 23 months and most of the time never makes it We cant wait for 6 months total for a refund and pay 150 dollars for a Fedex package to send the originals Which is more than the claim itself I have used Worldnomads for years and I have never been asked to send anything by surface mail
I hope youre able to help us out maybe you could push a button or two with Zurich to get this solved

I needed a stamp in a hurry On the phone of them said it would be okay and when I called back in 10 minutes another person said it wouldnt be possible and that nobody who worked there would have made that promise to me It ended up working out but then I left work early to pick it up at the arranged time On the drive there they told me they were all in the process of closing up 3 hours early because they always do that on Friday They left my stamps just outside their door and when I arrived they were still there The lady saw me pull up go back inside and lock the door I cant recommend this place due to their horrible customer service

I got a Quote online I sent all my books in one box Was told all packages were processed within three days Two weeks later I received an email saying by box was processed and it was missing one of the books When I questioned it they didnt respond and just sent me a check for the three they said they received A couple days later I received my book back in the mail The paperwork with it was for some other book Their customer service was pretty bad to not even know they had my book They never answered any of my concerns about the delay
horrible online experience
I brought my bike about two weeks ago on line my accessories arrived but the bike went missing It finally turned up after a week with scratches on the frame I was offered a light and lock kit as compensation
The pump I purchased is for Presta and Schrader I was unable to get it to work probable my fault I borrowed a friends presta pump and had no issues
Once i finally had my bike assembled I pumped my tires to 90 psi the tires are rated to a 110psi max and as i was putting my helmet on standing next to the bike the tire exploded i think i gave a few people a heart attack
I sent photos in of the damaged tire and reid aggreed to send me new tube I suggested sending it with the other items they were sending for compensation of my scratched frame
I waited a week for a reply and sent another email propt before calling as I had not heard nor received anything The excuse I got could be summed up as we forgot and they told me I can just go to the sydney store to pick up my stuff defeats the purpose of ordering online
At this stage I would just ask for them to send out a courier to pick up the bike and Id take my money back But after dealing with just the simple process purchasing the bike Im not sure I would want to put myself through trying to get a refund
What is good
Fast payment
Works on multiple platforms
Normally its working
Bad
Sometimes they just dont allow to use your PayPal credit you have to pay from your bank account even if you have enough credit uploaded
almost impossible to find useful information on their support center
incompetent customer support
Hard to contact customer support
Nothing wrong with the tape its good value for money but the wrong tape is always sent Initially they were good to rectify the orders but after about the third wrong order they just stopped replying to emails The last order comprised of uncut tape I ordered a mix of precut and uncut
Arrived at quadeloupe airport with confirmed reservation in hand Informed at rental desk that they had no cars available I was told that DiscoverCarHire had been informed of this however I received no email that there was a problem Eurocar said that the only car available was a high end auto at 1860 euros  about three times my confirmed rental cost
Since all other rental companies at airport had no cars available I had to hire a metered cab at a cost of 100 euros to get to our destination No response from DiscoverCarHire after 72 hours other than to say my deposit had been refunded A truly terrible experience Stephen Prescott
Very bad service
I tried to buy a product you asked for the number of my credit card the bank validated the payment but your company did not accept the purchase
I had to call my bank to make the claim and they returned my money which is not happening yet
Ive bought tickets with them and at the moment of my my flight I didnt have the permission of the company I called them from the aeroport they took hours and couldnt find the reason why I wasnt able to flight they just said buy a new ticket but it has to be the cheapest one you find after we will give your refund
I ve trying to contact to know about my refund but again they take ages to answer THEY ARE UNORGANIZED every time I talk to some one from customer service they give me a different answer MANY TIMES MANY TIMES they give their word they gonna call me back but it doesnt happen THEY PLAY WITH YOUR MONEY
My car was canceled due to a flightdelay and  out of the blue  I had lost my reservation and the cost of not renting a car Would car trawler help with a new car No Would they reimburse me for the car I had bought which they suddenly canceled because of my delay No Would they in any way help me No They would just take my money and runhope other people read this and have the good sense to choose another company for car hire
i bought a 900 worth of glasses and it was just but inside a box with out any protection
I ordered flowers for my Moms 70th birthday and they were never delivered I never got a phone call and neither did the local contact When I called the next morning nobody could tell me what happened to the delivery and offered no explanation On the bright side they did agree to provide a refund I guess Ill wait and see if that actually gets delivered
The collection of frames are not good specially for half rim framesand return policy is also very complex
I have not received my order yet so I cannot speak for the clothing however my mother purchased a giftcard for me to try Fabletics to see if I like it The first 2 months I had the giftcard every outfit I liked had at least 1 piece of it that was sold out in my size Finally this month new things come out that I like and are in my size I add things to my cart that totaled 50 so I could use my 50 giftcard When I enter my giftcard it removes all the promo prices and my 50 order turned into a 110 order So after the giftcard the total would have been 60 for me to pay Fabletics literally wanted me to PAY 10 to throw my giftcard in the trash Completely unacceptable So if you are thinking of buying a giftcard for someone so they can try Fabletics do NOT do it Giftcards I guess are only for people who are already members and already paying full price for the clothes
I just bought two flight tickets from Lima to Madrid the 24th of May at 6 pm with the air service Plus Ultra But we can not find any additional information about this company among the other company Bravo tours are operating with and we can not confirm anywhere that our booking is reliable We are in doubt that the air service is Plus ultra or Pluna  or neither of them
Bravofly can you help us with this please We can not log in either even though we have tried to get the password several times with our email
Bought on FlightHub for the first time While searching for a flight I was getting different prices on FlightHub depending on whether I accessed the site directly or came to the site through another site Then I realized in some cases the FlightHub site was automatically changing my CDN dollar selection into USD even though it still said I was on the Canadian site AND THEY WOULDNT LET ME SWITCH IT BACK selection became grayed out And the currency conversion was not even close to being fair The price in USD was substantially higher than in CDN after doing the conversion However I almost booked the USD ticket thinking I was getting a savings since I thought it was in CDN dollars since i had selected CDN dollars I saw the fine print stating USD at the last minute Ill bet a lot of people get tricked because one gets excited when they all of a sudden see an unbeatable price
So I reset everything and go to book the ticket in CDN dollars and it offers me seat selection In addition to the cost of the seat from the airline FlightHub wanted to charge me an additional 1595 per seat so an insane total of 4595 per seat I opted OUT of seat selection and get to the end where Im going to pay and lo and behold even though I have not selected any seats FlightHub has still added their 1595 x 2 seats charge I had to MANUALLY remove that charge just before paying after I had already opted out of selecting any seats earlier
Then I opted OUT of any promotional emails Guess what I received 3 promotional emails almost immediately after my purchase I try to opt out AGAIN by clicking Unsubscribe and their site says Im not even signed up
Deceptive pricing practices designed to trick people into paying more dishonest bill padding after I specifically opted out of certain offers and dishonest spamming email practices All in all a crappy experience I booked the ticket on the site because they offered a 40 discount as compared to booking directly with the airline Had I been in a rush and unable to scrutinize every tiny little step I would have been tricked into paying more Ill bet a lot of people do get tricked Its not easy to get one over on me and they almost succeeded
Next time Ill just book with the airlines I dont like it when companies try to trick me Too much hassle with the booking experience and too many ways to get tricked into paying more than the advertised price makes the whole experience risky and unpleasant
We purchased your product a few weeks ago Since its purchase and activation it continues to say not reporting We have gone through all of the help documents and regardless of whether or not the product is in or outside it is not reporting
Currently the lights indicate no GPS even though according to the coverage maps on their site via Tmobile we are located in a area with full 2g coverage We purchased the tracker from amazon and are returning the as product is not reliable and does not work as advertised
What is ridiculous is that in order to even know if the product will work you must sign up for service prior to even testing the tracker for reliability and accuracy Additionally the only way to contact support is via a pregenerated contact us email form that continues to recommend you to a place on the help blog and never actually responds According to their website they cannot will not refund amounts of purchased plans once paid for and in order to discover whether or not the tracker works you must purchase the service plans
The website is misleading with information it provides to the consumer and makes it really hard to understand your options with purchasing service
I am very tech savvy and have worked with several other tracking devices very successfully and was hoping this would work to track my pet effectively and accurately needless to say this product is not one I would recommend at all
Additionally customer service is horrible they only communicate via email and even then do not seem to resolve the problems with applicable answers They also takes days to respond
If you value your money and do not want to lose it DO NOT BUY

This is Rentalcarscom advertising Full Protection for complete peace of mind Excellent cover  all exterior  mechanical parts Far cheaper than typical overthecounter cover Interested Just choose your car then add Full Protection
And you choose Full Protection Then at the airport counter AVISBUDGET representative says that Rentalcarscom does not provide full protection Then you pay additional coverage Then you ask Rentalcarscom why their Full Protection is not recognized by AVISBUDGET Then a representative from Rentalcarscom apologizes for any confusions regarding the purchase of Full protection via Rentalcarscom and refund their Full protection price They even mention that you should phone them when dealing with the AVISBUDGET representative in order to confront Full Protection protection provided by them with additional coverage from AVISBUDGET Of course you should phone them because thats why you choose a car broker in the first place to complicate your life
Use Rentalcarscom to search for cars and hire the car directly from the provider In this way they will eventually clarify confusions regarding the purchase of Full protection warn you BEFORE getting to deal with the rental car representative and display a BIG phone number so you may step at the counter and put a trickster from Rentalcarscom in direct contact with the trickster from AVISBUDGET They may eventually cancel themselves and you will not have to deal with the aftermath for weeks after your car hire
Signed with Tomtop a while ago but I forgot my password The website said I could rest my password so I followed the procedure to be told I would get an email No email arrived and after 3 attempts to obtain a new password I was locked out of my account
The flowers I sent arrived in a bad condition and were falling apart I am not happy with the result and will not be ordering from Euroflorist again
Car trawler are ok for booking the car rental but low grade cars and poor service is not acceptable from certain rental companies
The customer service was extremely poor I did last Christmas shopping on Ssense They forgot to deliver one item When I called the customer service they made no conscious effort of replacing the item on time before Christmas After I talked to the manager she try to make it out as my fault not to order earlier Made no effort what so ever of admitting or resurrecting the error they made in time before Christmas I was horrified at their reaction Astounding appalling dreadful customer service
I used the Amoma website to book a hotel in Berlin There were two offers both at the same price but one included breakfast I inadvertently clicked on the offer without breakfast and although I contacted Amoma immediately and explained my mistake and that it was going to cost an extra 112 euros to pay for breakfasts for the stay all they could say was that they couldnt change the booking despite it being only made a couple of minutes previously Their only suggestion was that I contacted the hotel who in turn told me they had to abide with the original booking Customer service Dont look for it at this company because from my experience its dead
Do not trust this company They will rip you off if you dont speak Spanish
No one ever came No email back from HQ
I received an email stating I would get 35 off first purchase thought it would apply at completion of order and it didnt Now have to take the time to cancel order
At first I was really pleased with this website living in the French Caribbean I cannot find all of my hair products or makeup over there Ive ordered a couple of times from websites in the US and Shipito sent my packages just fine Last week I made a new purchase using exactly the same Visa Debit Card I used for my past transactions and of course making sure I had enough on my bank account for the transaction but I couldnt make a deposit since Shipito system keeps failing I raise a ticket and contacted customer service who told me that their IT team was looking into it and that I needed to provide a copy of my ID since they have changed their payment method in the meantime I purchased a couple of items on Amazon with the same debit card and the transaction went just fine The very next day trying to log into my Shipito account I realized that my login was not working I contacted Shipito customer support and they told me that I needed to contact their supervisor which I did by sending an email and got the following reply Please note that the ID that you have sent is a fake ID and Shipito has a zero tolerance policy for such behavior and therefore we are not able to reopen the account In order to get the package out of your account I will need you to have the merchant contact us to retrieve the package Regards Mariana G
I am not a fraud and my ID has been delivered to me in hand by the French Authorities and I really cannot accept to be call a fraud
Those people at Shipito are really arrogant and rude and decided based on I dont know which method that my ID was a fake one so if I had a fake ID how come I manage to get the ESTA document authorizing me to enter the US for the last couple of years How come the Israeli custom let me enter Israel a couple of times in the past
Shipito a tiny winy little website has such a great ID scamming tool that they should probably consider to sell it to other Big Players such as Amazon or even to Governments in order to reduce their so called fraud to ZERO
Do not use it trust this company I used them for a flight from Singapore to Phuket on kayak as they were the cheapest price however they take 24 hours to confirm your booking and then up the price just before you book the damn thing then you try to get your money back and it takes 7 days Never again they should be banned from trading
Sure the part that came works great in whatever it goes in Just isnt what I ordered and paid for Company has fast response time and apparently willing to refund after I find a way to print a return sticker and ship back
I put my correct VISA information in and clicked Pay Now I was taken back to the payment page I put the correct information in again with the same result There was no explanation as to what was going on I had to opay with AMEX incurring ab extra 3 charge This was a bad experience
My PR party was held on January 28 2017 so my guests would receive their orders by Valentines Day My consultant Darlene Ruiz assured us the orders would be delivered well before February 14th After a few weeks many of us didnt get our orders and it was one excuse after another Eventually some of my guests cancelled their orders and requested refunds One guest sent Darlene a message to cancel her order and then notified her credit card company and they credited her account She then placed an order online directly with PR and received her order in a few days But the credit card company reversed the credit after Darlene contacted them So Darlene had time to contact the credit card company to get money she is not entitled to but has not had time to issue refunds Some of my other guests still have not received their orders or their refunds after multiple requests for refunds When I contacted PR I was told I needed to contact Darlene PR sent me a missing item from my order after I provided a receipt and they also let me make a complaint They could not help me get my friends and family their refunds though I will not order anything from PR again
same thing has happened to me like many others on here paid first loan out and denied on the 2nd attempt annoyed
Your site changed and I cantfind any options for variable dates or close airports anymore  made reseqrching alternatives a pain when it used to be so easy
Bookingcom are useless I have been trying to sort an issue with them for 3 weeks The pictures of the gite I booked and the description in words do not match and they dont seem to think this is a problem You are promised return calls and emails which never materialise and you cannot speak to the same person twice Do not use this site
Ordered a swimsuit in early January now I wish I never had I never received the package and after reading other reviews I see that I probably never will This company is a scam They take your money and then never even send your package DO NOT order from them unless you want to throw your money away
I had to amend booking at the airport whilst picking up the car I should have had a full refund from the initial booking and then paid the full amount for a new booking I have just found out that RentalCars did not refund me the first booking from 7 weeks ago I am still waiting for their refund
I hired a car from rentalcars from 06032017 to 13032017 for our Tenerife holiday total price 81 when we picked up the car from Goldcar it was supposed to be full to full it was only 34 full we returnd the car full
when we arrived back home we found that goldcar had taken  110557 a few days latter goldcar reembursed us 104646 a differents of 5911
when we complaind to rentalcars they informed us that goldcar charged 14eur for an upgrade to a diesil car which we did not ask for  but that does not account for the extra 5911 rentalcars said that they could do nothing but offered us a discount on our next car hire  er no chance
I think Bibliocom is a great place but the first and only book that Ive ordered I will not do business with the company that I purchased it from again Their idea and mine of an almost new book are two entirely different things If I had owned this book I would not have deemed it good enough to even sell and I think it is an old library book although they did not state that It smells really dusty and Im debating whether to just throw it away It had something splattered on the side pages that the company never disclosed Had I picked up this book in the store I most definitely would not have bought it Also what they called a smudge on a corner is actually my definition of a destroyed corner  it wasnt a smudge At any rate I bought the book from gargoyle books and I think they need to get their act together better as to how they rate the quality of a book
I ordered Sofia bed in a bag in redgold and received a Chic bed in bad in redblack Since I didnt have a printer to print out a prepaid return label I was told to go to the library or my neighbors house and ask to use their printer There wasnt anyway I could get a label sent to me in the mail After getting the call escalated to a Supervisor I was told I had to wait 24hrs to see if you could schedule a pickup I also asked once the item was returned if they could just ship me out the correct item and I was told no I would have to pay another 70 and order the item again Well first of all I wont get a credit for the item that was shipped incorrectly to me until 34 weeks and whos to say if I will get the correct item if I order it again In that case I will be waitin another 33 weeks for another refund thats 140 and I still wont have what I ordered I think that is such an inconvenience and poor customer service Ive decided not order the item and just wait 1 month for my refund
Help others make better choices by writing this Frankly id just go elsewhere and not last minute about doing it either Booked a week ago money taken before id even confirmed or so it felt and out comes the your booking isnt confirmed yet but should be within 48hrs spiel which was obviously an afterthought as if to say hey we might be robbing you to the point of disappointment coz you wont be able to go on holiday and your refund if they bother will leave you unable to do anything even last minute
Call centres are overseas and might as well be entirely robotic as a conversation isnt even possible the customer care team pauses for thought after every sentence clearly finding the appropriate response from a sheet of preempted phrases When they cant understand the problem they simply put you on hold to pick up two minute or more later and tell you that it has been passed to another team with absolutely ZERO explanation as to what is happening with your booking Last minute employee program no training whatsoever
In summary Avoid
Lnga lev tider
1 I do not understand why I cannot call the Customer Service  Sale Agent for a new quotation I always have to wait for the Call Back no sense
2 The chat is really basic and every time I was chatting with somebody I always got poor explanations on my questions Really bad service
3 Why do I have to pay 20 Euro for the Second driver Certificationnone of the other Companies is charging for this
4 If I want to insure my Second Car with 25Plus company it cost me 2770 Euro yes this is the price of my last Quote  crazy I have 5 years no claim bonusand if I try to understand or ask for a discount on that price the Customer Service answers is Im sorry if you got it on line unfortunately we cannot change anything
5 Why do I have to pay 48Euro if I want to transfer my policy to a newer car For the Car Ive already registered I should pay even less
I have many other points to write down but Ill summarise everything in one world unacceptable
Ive been for 5 years 25plus Customer but lately Ive been treated really bad That will be the reason to change soon to a better Company
Thank you
the site wont let me report my buythey say I can save over a 1000dllson savingsi could get a better deal my self
One item was out of stock I was never notified I called them to find out what was happening After the rest arrived was the first I knew anything The first two calls I was disconnected I may never buy from them again
NEVER BOOK THROUGH LAST MINUTE Having the worst experience with last minute  Kuwait Airways I booked my flight to Sri Lanka last October only to be told 6 weeks before departure that my flight had been cancelled and that there is no alternative flight and so the only possible option provided by the airline is a refund
I put in a request for this refund 3 weeks ago and havent seen a penny In this time I have also booked a brand new flight as I still need to get to Sri Lanka
After many emails asking about the status of my refund I have today received an email telling me there IS in fact an alternative flight So now I have bought two separate flights to Sri Lanka and dont even know if and when I will be getting any money back
They have taken up to a week to respond to my emails so I have little faith that I will be receiving my refund before my trip which is 350 of my spending money that I wont have anymore
Furthermore if I do choose to take this alternative flight with Kuwait airways and cancel my new flight Ive had to book I will be charged 160 to do so So make that 510 of spending money in the bin
Thanks for ruining my holiday before Ive even got there Top work 
If you travel with one way ticket and you are not sure about when your return date is dont deal with connections Cancelation and modification are ruinously expensive They wanted to charged me 350euros for a cancelation and more if I decided to change the date thats crazy This is cheaper to take the flight you want to change or cancel and after right take another plane back form where you took off 10hours before Definitely not green solution at all 
Made a withdrawal to my bank account and was told on the app I will receive the money within two hours but surprise surprise it didnt go in Had to jump through hoops to speak to someone in customer service who told me I wont receive within two hours and will be 72 hours instead They offered no help they were just reading from a script Had to wait a hour to speak to a supervisor who couldnt do anything or explain why I was mislead by this timeframe Will not use PayPal again as it is not fast and easy to use it is a absolute joke
I found I ordered the wrong size 5 minutes after the order is placed I left a message immediately and ask for the change no one response and I received the small cards instead of the correct size I wanted I found that I can change the order any time before the printing This is not true
Agoda make errors in quoting for hotel again and I have to pay hotel charges not Quote d
Watch out for the small print in the Agoda Quote where Agoda Quote you in your currency and state that the hotel may charge you in the local currency with extortionate exchange rates making again a mockery of their Quote 
There are many flags signalling a bad experience with this company
First I didnt realize I was booking through them or I wouldnt have
Second there was no cancellation fee until I received their confirming email60
Third the hotel after 28 days does not have a reservation for me
Fourth Ive been on hold with Customer Service for 40 minutes so far
Fifth Im disputing all charges with my credit card company and filing a fraud complaint with the appropriate US Government Agency
Use this company at your peril
Took nearly an hour to arrive When I ring the wok inn directly it takes 20mins to arrive usually Food was not too warm when received
True car is a bunch of do nothing leaches that feed off of car buyers They charge dealers 399 for their leads and the consumer has to pay over that figure Dont waste your time just do your research and go to your dealer of choice and ask for the True Car price and youll get it If you submit a True Car lead you WILL pay more Hope that helps Remember True car charges the dealer and the dealer charges YOU
We purchased a mattress set and didnt think to say there was an old mattress to be taken away When I asked the delivery team if they could take it they said they couldnt if it hadnt been arranged previously with the salesperson
As the last delivery of the day it would have been a good customer experience to accept when I asked if they wouldcould take the old set
Getting a refund for a cancelled flight was complicatedseemed impossible I was talking to a different person at customer service every time I called and my request was never registered which had to be started all over again They aksed me to send them all my documentation and havent heard from them I couldnt speak to the manager about the issue because this was going nowhere which was frustrating I finally got my refund back after calling them every single day but 3 months later than the expected date As long as you dont need to cancel your flight you should be ok
The car was advertised as unlimited mileage but turned out to be limited There appears to be no email contact through which I can refer this matter
Just spent two hours on phone with Paypal  they are holding my money illegally and fraudulently They say once the tracking shows the products arrive they will release funds in 3 days They dont Ive had to manually go through 200 items at the cost of countless hours of my time to get my funds released Have multiple hours of bad customer service recorded and am working on a media story about this On top of that they released my account hold 12 days ago and now have placed it back on my account This is just wrong The customer service SUPERVISOR told me this morning that he could assure me the hold was ONLY for the one larger transaction and that all of my other TRANSACTIONS would process okay I made him wait while I had my wife purchase a 6 item where in fact my funds were held complete lie The only option is to wait 21 days for my money or spend hours on the phone going through transactions This company is engaged in unfair trade practices racketeering and fraud Representing to a customerseller that you will not hold their money in order to induce them to continue accepting payments on your system when this is not true is wire fraud and a violation of FTC regulations I expect someone in your back office as they call it who is a decision maker and a human in America not reading from a computer screen to reach out to me via facebook messenger and provide me with their direct line or I will be reporting this ongoing issue with 15 recorded phone calls of completely conflicting information to the Federal Trade Commission the FBI and the media
1 channel was added later Other channel could be included for another fee
I wish I could give 5 negative stars Its been almost 2 months since I purchased 2 websites Cant get anyone to call me back to let me know the status of the project and the one time I did get a date via email on when it would been finished it wasnt So now I have no idea whats going on Horrible experience so far Worst
I wish the people who Ive already paid to setup our websites was as responsive as their sales guy was
Their project manager Tiffany Lloyd is horrible and doesnt answer simple questions and is not competent to meet the simple deadlines she sets or give regular feedback
Thomas Norton  I think he is some guy who is working on my website who knows He has poor communication skills and wont give status reports either
Tried using their chat support today and they didnt know what was going on either The person I was chatting with said they would submit a ticket for me which Ive already done many times with no results Thats why I was trying to use their chat support
This company is the worst

VOUS AVEZ MON ARGENT
I ordered in Worcester and gave DETAILED delivery instructions for the driver Upon arrival the driver Marlene called and that was about the only thing she got correct I asked her to confirm her location per the instructions the complex I live in occupies an entire city block and she verified she was at the right place Walked down 3 flights of stairs shes not there Walked back up to get my phone called again to CONFIRM where she was supposed to be After constantly interrupting me during this exchange and after finally getting her to listen she said she would be right there After waiting outside for over 10 minutes again no show I called a THIRD TIME only to get more interruptions and attitude She said she would refer this to her dispatcher which was actually a relief I might actually get to talk to someone who can LISTEN after which I hung up and contacted Foodler When I DID get my food I was met with snarky remarks and smirks from the driver Marlene
I truly hope the dispatcher I spoke with takes action with Marlene She exhibited some of the WORST customer service I have experienced in a very long time
I ordered a specific product as a gift needed with a specified deadline I was sent the wrong product After multiple attempts to remedy the situation and back and forth with ineffective emails where multiple customer service people are responding I gave up with trying to have an equitable remedy for the situation I felt like I was given the run around When I was asked to send photos of the product one customer service rep sent me back an email saying the products look the same They were an entirely different product than the one ordered In the time he took to respond to that initial email I could tell he spent no time actually looking at the substantial differences The whole experience of numerous ineffective sales reps was extremely frustrating and ultimately useless
In order to get free shipping I can only use my physical address But UPS has an agreement with my post office to transfer packages less than a certain weight to USPS So I have to have both my mailing and physical address on the label when using UPS Your system wont allow me to do that
I had assumed this was a UK company Ordered some light bulbs based on shipping of 13 days What they didnt say was the items would be shipped from China so I think the 13 days was tie to dispatch  goodness knows how long they will take to arrive I was then slapped with a 30 import fee from DHL The order was only for 107 So I mailed to cancel the order before it left China To be told to pay the fee send them the invoice and they would refund it against some insurance policy I said I wanted to cancel and get a full refund to which they will only offer back 88 I believe this is illegal under distance selling regulations so am going to contact my bank to get the transaction refunded that way A very suspicious company
I purchased a cordless hoover off DID Basically its pure rubbish and wouldnt suck air never mind dirt I only needed it for light work dusty tile floor and a little dirt from people in and out Anyway it is brutal I tried to contact customer service on a few occasions and could not even get an answer never mind get talking to anyone I left messages for someone to call me back and as yet NOTHING I have given up and will suffer the crappy hoover and chalk this one down to experience
I was very disappointed to find that this year my insurance had almost doubled since last year and when speaking to 25 plus the attitude was one of not a lot you can do and to be told my insurance had gone up because of everything which I found a very pathetic way of an explanation for the increase
I brought a brand new phone on eBay The phone stopped working within 3 months The trader would not help me  or respond Pay pal told me they decided a resolution in the sellers favour No come back  no money back  no phone replacement Buyer beware
I went online to purchase 4 tickets for the last monster truck show on the 4th in the Georgia dome When I purchased the tickets and put my card info in I received a receipt showing me the datetime and total purchase price And at the bottom of the page it says that I will get a email with the tickets and to print them out to take with us by the 2nd On the 3rd I still didnt get one so I called and was on hold for at least 40 mins just to find out that my ticket purchase was rejected cause I put to many letters in my email address so they couldnt send me the tickets But my thing is I seen where I screwed up the email address but my phone number was correct on the paper We bought those tickets a good 2 weeks in advance so why didnt I get a phone call Very upset about it They should have it where you have to confirm your email twice before submitting the card or at least try to call you if theres a problem Hence the reason it ask for your number
The total bill ended up being 200 for 1 night I think that it was unfair as the rate is nonrefundable Single Mom issues
Waste of money When uploading photos online it indicated the photo quality was good The paper finishing I chose was the most expensive one too The photos in the actual product were grainy and colour was not flattering as shown in the preview on screen The expensive finishing did not flatter the product at all The product was so unpresentable it could not be used Utter disappointment
More thane one month waiting
After that i cancelled one of my glasses but you didnt return my money back to me 
Booked flight to Tokyo changing in Shanghai China Eastern cancelled booking had to go through LM to get rebooked
After 5 days of hassle booked by the company on a flight that loses us a day so have tried to change LM deliberately delays distracts and promises to help you until you give up and accept a poor cheaper alternative because you are stressed and have no time or will to continue the battle and are fed up with borderline lies from powerless call handlers
Have called at least 8 times  each time the request for a different flight is being escalated This is obviously not happening and this department does not appear to exist and seems to be a deliberate ploy to keep you hanging on in hope and having to accept an unacceptable alternative when you finally run out of time and patience
The booking team is never available and does not appear to actually exist either You are promised that you will receive an email or call within the hour or that evening with alternatives but nothing ever happens and you are consistently told to wait 7 days after each part of the process If you ask to hold to speak to the booking team the call does not get answered
They want you off the phone as quick as possible They do not call back or email when they say they will You have to call and start again from scratch with a different agent who will read back you previous calls and promise he is escalating it It is a painful pointless loop
Please avoid booking flights with Lastminute The saving you are offered at the the beginning will be offset by your time stress and disappointment
I realized just after I booked that I had booked the wrong time slot so I called the number provided I was connected to an operator right away but was consistently given wrong information when I tried to reschedule I was told that I would have to pay 120 additional for rebooking the flight for a 12 hour earlier time slot but the receipt when I did it was for 186 I asked about the original amount I had paid for the later time slot and was told that I had to pay that too None of these charges came through correctly on my credit card the 186 was the total including what I had already paid I ended up cancelling the flight and booking through another service for 58 total I would not choose to use your service again
I am trying this one more time but when I was last on the site and tried to make a purchase the discounts were not going in my cart correctly
I tried the online chat for support and waited for over 10 minutes and no one showed up I also submitted a help ticket through the form 3 days ago and still havent heard anything back The only reason I came back was because the new discount you sent me applied to all of the things I wanted to get overall  and I didnt have to deal with the individual item sales
I have been a Ssense customer for many years since they started selling online actually I have purchased many times with superb shipping and customer service However I dont think I will be shopping again on Ssense due my most recent situation with them
Im originally from Toronto and move to Greece permanently I was visiting Toronto for holidays my best mate and I saw a pair of boots online Marsells and wanted to buy a pair for each other for Christmas So we called the store in Montreal and asked them to bring the boots in so we can try them on they are 860 so we wanted them to fit perfectly  We gave the store more than a weeks notice We drove 6 hours to the Montreal store only to find out that only one pair was brought in We told the staff that we came from Toronto specifically for these boots but the staff didnt care and did nothing to resolve the situation The store staff really made this experience horrible and didnt have any empathy for what happened
The best part of this whole situation is that the Marsell boots increased in price the next day and we dont know why
My mate emailed your staff telling them about the mishap but again nothing was done to resolve the situation
I think I am done with Ssense your staff left a horrible taste in my mouth
All rubbish Cant even install one driver I repeatedly requested
For example allowing Truspilot to spam me without my permission
When I tried to pick up my car the booking was gone and I had to pay more than twice the agreed price usd 500 more Cartrawler refuse to reimburse me and will not even state their reason for not doing so They do not even respond to my emails anymore I have been fighing them for 20 months without success I will now have to sue them in an Irish court of law
i booked through you as i saw that winter tyers are included when i got there i had to pay an extra 144 sfr which isnt planned in my budget As i complained at the counter i got told to go through rentalscarscom if you have the sign up that winter tyers are included i shouldnt have to pay extra will arrange something else nxt time
The agent I chose from the list provided soon lost interest When asked what was going on he said he loses thousands from his commission by being selected from an open agent list and has other full paying customers he would prefer to work on
I had no idea this service was so expensive
While the girl that I ended up working with on Airtasker was 100 amazing and we have connected with her outside of Airtasker for further work
Airtasker itself is a horrible platform As I looked into the way that the people completing the tasks are treated it becomes apparent that Airtasker does nothing but devalue peoples work and serves to harm the economy by allowing people to undercharge for work that needs to be done and takes advantage of people who might be desperate for extra income
It has also come to my attention that Airtaskers community guidelines are drastically skewed in favour of the task poster even though the Airasker fee comes out of the Airtaskers fee
I ordered this item as I specifically wanted the older version of this toy which was the one listed on eBay The item I received was not the item pictured Terrible customer service they refused to answer the question if they had the item pictured Wont order from them again
My very first experience with this type of situation Placed an order 6 days ago and it was immediately paid for via PayPal 2 days later I had to submit documentation proving my identity even though PayPal authorized my payment 6 days later and order is still being processed and I paid for Expedited Shipping
Ive ordered from US and International companies all shipping to my international address and I have never encountered a situation like this before cant process and ship an item already paid for in 6 days
Alibaba cancelled my membership after I opened a few disputes for not receiving the items What am I supposed to do Pay and not get the item There buyer protection is a joke It is not meant to be protecting the buyer but the seller to get more shipping time The item never come ontime and I received messages from Alibaba to advice me about time is running out then I opened dispute But after I did it a few times now they cancel my account
The product is cheaper than other places but the quality is very poor specially the clothing items
3 days and no update my item hasnt even moved
Not work this code
I bought a template for them and told them what I wanted to which I was told it was all fine Once installed I couldnt use wordpress or do anything I had asked them
I asked for a refund as it didnt do what I was promised to which they refused
AWFULtake your money and thats it
10 restocking fee for sunglasses Its not like its a kitchen appliance

RIPOFF
TrueCar works for the car dealers I saved over 4000 useing Capital ones auto navigator and after you find that deal of a lifetime there is no way to input it into TrueCar where you got the deal and how much you saved
Steer clear
The trousers I received were not made consistently with the measurements I provided The trousers had a maximum circumference equal to my provided thigh measurement this would be fine for a pair of tights but as they are trousers this makes them far too tight to move in
I contacted tailor 4 less regarding this matter only to be told that as I had left it too long to contact them 2 months they would not remake the incorrectly made trousers
I can understand why they limit the time of the fit guarantee but this should not apply when the trousers havent even been made consistently with the measurements provided
Terrible service will go elsewhere in future
Stated delivery date March 1 Havent recieved my order yet Rather dissatisfied with delivery date I hope I recieve it soon
Ordered on line and product never showed up No correspondence as to where it is the tracking number said pending but never gave any real info
I ordered a green screen backdrop with Backdrop Source It arrived with 3 large tears around the edge When I contacted the company and ask they send a new and undamaged unit their response was to put gaffer tape on it which I could order on their website 
After my disbelief with their response made way for outrage I emailed again This time they said I could send it back after which they would send another unit
When I didnt get any response after having sent back the damaged unit and checked where its was it turned out to be in a local Auspost depot 2km from BackdropSources location Apparently noone was around when they came by to deliver it But BackdropSource didnt want to pick it up at the depot and told me to contact Auspost and have them deliver it to them
Again in total disbelief I emailed again and asked for them to pick it up 2km away and send me the new unit After that I finally received a new undamaged green screen The whole process has taken more than 6 weeks Very poor service and return policy Dont order from BackdropSource
All I can say is these sorts of companies will be out of business very soon once Amazon lands in Australia
On misterautoie I ordered multiple parts for 2 cars at once the packages were broken down into 4 parcels which were delivered at different times and delayed me from working on my cars
But after the parts arrived one of them was a wrong part which required me to purchase it from a car part store anyway
Now I am going through a return process which requires more of my time and wait up to 15 days for a refund
Simply unacceptable
My experience with this site is wonderfulI sure will recommend FlightHub to my friendsfamilieslimited and unlimited liability company and company who want d best and qualitative servicethump up FlightHubkisses and hugs if acceptedThanks for your cheaperfaster and dependable servicelove yall
Purchased a rear wiper arm for my 2003 Volvo XC90 which the website says is the correct arm for my vehicle but not the genuine Volvo part I should have known the price was too good to be true The part would fit in that it would attach to the bolt but it is much skinnier and angled differently than the genuine Volvo part It also does not connect to the wiper blade in the same way as the Volvo part it leaves an ugly gap between the arm and the blade while the genuine parts connect almost seamlessly
So Im very disappointed and I go to print a return label only to find that the label is going to cost me almost the entire cost of the wiper arm
I will never use this site again
Update
After the response below from the website I confirmed that I did order the correct part which the site lists as the correct part for my car the T6 model
Update 2
Even after searching with my VIN the first result is still the incorrect wiper arm that I purchased The correct arm does show below Im not a mechanic How am I supposed to know my vehicle chassis number If I select the correct vehicle the parts that show up should fit my car Period
tried to contact and was hung up on twice and on hold both times for a long long time and still trying to contact them
My order took 6 days to arrive we needed the product sooner not very pleased with the delivery system
Tickets can later then promised to close to venue date and becasuse I couldnt go to event I had to eat the tickets Would not use them again
Access to my account was closed without any notification After contact with customer support they ask me to change my email password After changing they stop contact to me All my money was stolen
room pricing is misleading Exorbitant special fees etc added after reservation made
They charge me an extra 1000 dollars on top of what i was paying Not buying thru then again
An unwell and vulnerable relative mistakenly believed a service was due on her car booked it in for a 102 service and was told over 1000 worth of additional work was required to make the car safe which she felt pressured to agree to I can prove that none of this work was necessary from the records we have and the prices charged for the extra work were extortionate 3 emails and a phone call over 3 weeks and still no response from the company to our complaint Please dont let anyone you know especially if they do not have the confidence or knowledge to avoid buckling under pressure when the phone call comes fall victim to this company
Worst service Ive ever had from anyone Terrible product i will never go to Gardner white again
I am in the process of changing my insurance coverage for my home and auto I contacted SelectQuote and was assisted by Adam Wainbright I did not realize that I had made a final commitment to insure my home with Safeco Insurance When I called today to say I was not comfortable with my decision his entire tone became unhelpful and abrupt I am 64 years old and I am not an expert in insurance I needed a courteous person to help advise me and instead I had to deal with a pushy sales person Mr Wainbright needs to learn manners and respect for your customers 
Im still waiting for my order from about 3 weeks ago Not sure what happened with it I live in a apartment building and should of gotten a notice to pick up at local post office but nothing Can you look into please I ordered on the 18th of January 2 bottles of the NYCskincare vitamin c serum WHere is it
Thank you
I have no audio on windows 10 Says I need driver update This Did nothing to help
I normally book my cats through DoYouSpaincom but this time I decide to book directly through Gold Car as I thought I would have more security in my booking but this was not the case I paid upfront for the booking but unfortunately missed my flight and arrived 7 hours after the pickup time but on the same day and I was refused my car I had paid for upfront with insurance for 4 days Although knowing there were many cars still available in the parking lot the staff we rude and unhelpful and refused me a car I understand this is a business but I believe a company like this should have a duty of care to their customers knowing they are in a foreign country Rather then leaving a woman travelling on her own stranded in the airport late at night
I found this whole expierence very nerve wrecking and it caused me great upset and huge disappointment in Gold Car and complete disgust in the behaviour of their staff
My recommendation is DO NOT BOOK WITH GOLD CAR
I made absolutely sure that I had unchecked all the extra services that come with a charge and double checked my total including taxes However when I went to purchase the tickets I found the next page had included an extra charge for insurance that was added to my total and charged to my card automatically I was furious because the new totally only shows up on the receipt when printed This practice is deceitful and highly unethical
You can Judge and remember when you are booking by Rentalcars or Europcar
I will not tell the whole story that has lasted more than two months but I will make only a brief summary
After booked with Rentalcars on web a car in Lisbon at the Europcar branch AvAntonio Augusto Aguiar 24 C  D 1050016 Lisboa I showed up at the desk the day January 8 2017 Sunday morning for pickup 
I presented the voucher Rentalcars to the clerk of Europcar with rental details
After a few minutes the clerk introduced me to sign the contract on which appeared a cost not provided and a voice of increased cost compared to the precontract with Rentalcars
To my representations for noncompliance with what was foreseen in the voucher in my possession he responded negatively also threatening not to give me the car
After having unsuccessfully tried to telephone Rentalcars not to ruin the holidays before even having started I signed the contract thinking to clarify what happened later
Coming back I contacted Rentalcars which refunded me the increased figure compared to the additional driver but did not take the slightest regard for my refund request for the cost item Cl Airport Serv from  3075 for delivery in place other than the withdrawal
As you can see from the screenshot below on my voucher that fee is ZERO
CatturaJPG
I asked to Europcar and Rentalcars repayment of that amount but at the moment no answer
Regardless of the scandalous consideration towards the customer demonstrated by employee of Europcar would you see who is trying to screw me Rentalcars because he sold me a voucher with false entries or Europcar that doesnt care about what is written on this

This company would not refund or exchange a dress I ordered that was too small I would never recommend anyone buy from this company
Because hotels fear to lose booking magic ranking they tend to accept over bookings and put people in other hotels It just happened to me and its not acceptable
Ive been sent from Coco Beach hotel in Costa Rica to a hotel which does not even have one unique name Los Almendros or Manuel Antonio Park hotel
And I had to pay 90 dollars for this place
I placed an order for a knee brace based on the sizing guide on the website When the order had been placed I received some paperwork that included some different sizing instructions for the item I ordered
When it arrived it was miles too big
I followed the instructions for returning the item but after two weeks PR claimed it had not been received
I am now pursuing a claim via the Royal Mail but Im not hopeful of getting my money back as I have no proof of posting
This problem has only arisen because of the wrong instructions on the website and yet PR have not accepted any responsibility whatsoever
Make sure youre confident of what you order and if you have to return it get proof of posting and insurance
DONT BUY FROM TOMTOP They are the most incompetent company Ive had to deal with yet Good even getting an email reply from these clowns Tomtop is a joke I give them negative stars By far the worst internet buying experience Ive had yet And I buy more online than anyone I know Trust Dont buy from tomtop

I really enjoy looking through the tidy easy to navigate website of Pond5

Entrusted the site bookingcom which I have been using quite long time however the suggested price was twice more than from other resource To all visitors of bookingcom pls check several resorces prior to booking

I ordered on Jan 5 2017 and still waiting First I waited the allotted time 15 days and checked Oh it was received processed and shipped Still nothing Yes i understand that ALL your products come from other places and shipping  so dont bother responding with the crap You sent me a response that says YOU have until Mar 25 2017 Well today is the 20thI checked again nope nothing moving First off Why dont you tell people that the product is coming from China and that they apparently take the first 2 mo off and completely shut down No mail no shipping no workers to get the orders because they close for New Years What I could have sewn them by nowNow I understand why you have so many complaints So if my products arent here by on the 25th of this month give me back my money But then again Im probably going to have to hire a lawyer to get that back
terrible returning process
The price was quite fair but they dont notify you that your item is not really instock until after youve placed your order Instock means instocknot it will be instock soon please be patient Classic bait and switch
Many Phone call no one knows what they are doing one tells you one thing the other another tells you lies and money held on to to Gain interest on your money
We booked a package for a weekend in Madrid for our family of four  10th12th March 2017We arrived in Madrid and were initially pleased with the basic but well sized and well located apartment It was clean with comfortable beds and appeared to be everything we wanted However after a day enjoying Madrid we returned to our apartment for a much needed good night of sleep This was not to be
There is a huge issue with noise with the apartment we were givenIt does not affect the whole block No sound proofing is in existence and this is our complaint  Friends of ours were located facing onto a small courtyard at the rear and slept with no noise interference whatsoever
By contrast we had enormous difficulty even getting to sleep The street our apartment overlooked had constant pedestrian traffic It had little vehicular access so is the main thoroughfare for pedestrians in the area This is is not clear in the description on the website We are reasonable and do not expect zero noise in a city centre apartment In the last 6 months we stayed very centrally in Rome and Tallinn We had some noise but nothing on this scale I will now describe a night in the apartment
1 Constant background noise  as large numbers of people use this thoroughfare to access nightlife in the areathe first time last minute com made us aware that we were staying in the one of the liveliest night streets in Madrid was on one of the many calls I made whilst in Madrid a representative said words to the effect of what do you expect you are one one of the busiest night streets in Madrid We NEVER would have booked had we known this Last minute com did not share this information until we were already there
2 This background noise steadily increased from midnight onwards as groups of young people became more inebriated and rowdy We estimate we finally got to sleep around 2am We simply became used to a level of noise
3 At around 3am drunken groups processed along the street singing and shouting Motorbikes were ridden up and down We were woken by this
4 At around 4am an extremely loud alarm went off  and stayed in this state for around 20 minutes We were woken and that was the end of sleep for the night because
5 Street cleaning commenced with jet washing bin hauling street cleaners shouting to each other
6 We were still awake at sunrise
Our grounds for complaint
a we were not told that this street is probably the biggest nightlife street in Madrid Until here We would NEVER have booked this for us and our two children
B no attempt had been made made by the proprietor to sound proof There is a wooden shuttered door to the Juliette balcony with single glass panels in it Noise from the street travels straight through as if we were staying in a garden shed on Leicester Square in London Other properties on this street used for residential purposes are double glazed and then a second layer of double glazing in the form of an additional patio door arrangement over the top In other words four times the noise protection
C I rang last minutecom at around 7am on Saturday 11th march advising of problem and requesting a resolution as we have 2 children and were only in Madrid for 2 nights
We were promised a call back by 10am local time We ended up calling last minutecom ourselves at around 1115 This call went on for around 40minutrs at our expense We were told and this always seemed to be the excuse that they had tried to call to no avail Nobody else has had any problem getting hold of me there
The employee told me that the local agent would contact me and I would have to sort it with them I refused as my contract is not with the agent It was with last minutecom They made the contract with the agent for inadequate accommodation I did not
I made the point that much of my short time in Madrid was now feeling stressful and I wanted to know we could all sleep well tonight so I requested it sorted asap
The operator called me back 4 hours later to tell me that he couldnt promise anything but I neeed to talk to the agent He said they were offering 15 discount I refused this as I wanted to be rehoused as we desperately needed some sleep
I requested that last minutecom place us elsewhere I was told that the person that I was speaking to did not have the authority to do this I asked to speak to his superior who informed me that he would escalate my complaint At this point I felt frustrated I knew night time was approaching and we would be facing a night of no sleep once again I knew it would be difficult to find somewhere else to stay if it was left too late
I was promised a call back but was told it might not be the same day 
The call finally came around 5pm and we were told that last minutecom would not move us however they tried to tell us this was the fault of the agency 
We were made to an endure a second night of virtually no sleep
my husband travels extensively with his company As a family we travel abroad 35 times per year We have never had an experience like this We have done our utmost to sort the issue but with no support from last minutecom
We were given an apartment not fit for purpose You cannot sleep in it at night
It is like sleeping from a noise perspective on a busy street next to a night club
It is ideal for partygoers who wish to party to the small hours and sleep during the day noise is substantially less in daylight hours The apartment description does not make it clear that apartments at the front are subject to constant crowd noise through the night and are unsuitable for those who wish to sleep at night
Hugely disappointing experience
I am still hoping but doubtfullast minutecom does something to rectify its shocking treatment of a family Particularly its attempts to direct complaints towards the third party agency instead of dealing with it themselves
if there was option for 0 stars i would give it instead Nothing but scammers I paid 80 for the next month and next day i got the device removed yet they do not pro rate so i did not get any refund Also be aware they charge you 60 for closing the account I have no idea what all they have to do to close the account that costs 60 but save your words because they will respond you signed the lease you should have read
Wonderful items on the website ordered one pair of su glasses payed for themarrived an empty box
Good were only shipped after nearly 2 weeks  despite showing as in stock  they were only shipped after I said to cancel the order Up until that point all I was getting told was that the goods will be sent soon Furthermore the goods werent sent by royal mail but by hermes  they very rarely deliver down my road Oh and the items were left on my doorstep
i have a problem with a mobile i ordered it has a problem with the screen and the touch i send 4 times mail and attachments but no reply
I purchased an expensive TV from Groupon1300 It arrived in a plain cardboard box that clearly was NOT the manufacturers box It otherwise looked ok and so I hung it up and plugged it in It was defective Horribly so Weird bright lines and lights all over the left side of the screen
I immediately called to return the item After explaining that I couldnt just take this 70 TV to the post office to return and that it arrived via freight the customer service rep said that the shipper will come to pick it up and that I will receive a refund 10 days later Not ideal but I waited
A week later I called to find out why the tv had not been picked up The rep apologized and said that the shipper will contact me to schedule a pick up That never happened of course
I called back a week later and said that I was going to have to sue if the shipper did not contact me soon The customer service rep said that he would escalate the matter but he could not explain what that meant
I then filed a complaint with AmericanExpress hoping they can force a reverse charge and I am also going to file a suit in small claims court if AmEx cannot resolve the issue for me
DO NOT EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY
The taste of the fake sugar in the cold brew coffee was horrible I could not finish the can
Hello
Its now 2 weeks and I still didnt get my contacts
This is terrible and I am extremely upset
I am never going to order from you again
Sorry for the bad review  But its the truth
I advise not to work with this company at any time because they are the worst company in the market for this field and I have a very negative experience with this company since November 2016 till today starting from the owner  Erik Vanoosten  till to the Social Media Advocate  Aiesha Bowie  Do not trust them or give them your personal information  They can affect badly your credit report or credit score Their team are not professional to assist you When they inquire for your credit report  they usually use and add a hard inquiry to your credit report which will stay in your report for two years and affect your credit badly  That what they did with me and with my wife without any respectful reason or even my permission  They could use the soft inquire which is the normal and right one for any one who work in this field When I asked them to fix this issue  They refused to remove this mistake or give me any supportOne the other hand when I contacted the TransUnion credit company for this inquiry  They advised that the Quicken Loan company has the right to add or remove this inquiry When I contacted this company to fix the issue after that they lied and told me that they could not do anything to helpAgain dont trust this company for any services You will lose your credit score very quick and easy to get a bad credit report
i think it is very shady and unfair business to charge me when i dont skip a month and then i had a build up credits but when i try to use those credits you also cant use them all at once you still have to purchase at least one full price itemi already paid for the credits why cant i use them all at once
I dont hate these guys but theres better out there They were way too costly and rude to my children for playing in the boxes that I was paying big bucks for It made it a horrible experience and made me bitter about handing them the extra surprise costs at the end I kept my mouth closed but ill definitely avoid them in future
I ordered swimming suit on line from Macys  with shipment cost and duties almost 20000 I never received it
Called numbers of times to customer service No resolution never received credit no shipment No customer service Please stay away if you dont want to lose your money Horrible customer service
Annoying
Unnecessary
I hate this company with a passion The clothes are NOT worth the money and they refuse to refund you even when you are completely displeased with the products
I called your company because I needed a lid to a 1 12 quart corningware square dish I gave the lady the size You sent me a lid way too big I called when I received it I was told I was not charged for the lid but it was shipped to me I told the lady that was wrong I did order the lid She said she would change it and I should wait for my credit card bill and then call back I got the credit card bill and I called this morning The lady I spoke to said she could not help me and I should call 781 5705601 ext 704 I called I got a lady whose accent is so terrible I could not understand her She had to spell out everything for me She was not very smart either I told what size I ordered and she could not get it straight She said I should send a picture of it to you comopany All I wanted was a return label I told I did not have a camera Oh you have to send a picture Well di I have to hire someone to come to my house and take a picture and then send it to you I am a senior this is not easy
So if I send a picture how will this help you It is still too big I an send a picture and show the lid and then show the dish and you can see it is too big fot the dish Hiring someone to come here and take the picture will cost more than three lids
If I do not get any satisfaction from you I will dispute the charge with the credit card company
The ady at extension 704 english accent was so bad I could not understand her trying to give me your email address It took ten minutes just to figure her out

The ordering and delivery process had been fine I believe the correct part was delivered I would like to grade Stockwise higher but the window motor did not function Well see if I can get a refund Maybe I can change the grade
Apparently I left off the apartment number on my order UPS was able to fix it but the quiche sat outside of my friends apartment in the sun in Phoenix It was delayed a whole day and was defrosted by the time he received he threw it out Bake Me a Wish offered to send something else but I have to pay the 20 in shipping Trying to decide if I want to spend more money Disappointing
This company is either crooked ignorant or incompetent They have the most untrained mechanics Mechanics do not carry proper tools for diagnosis
Their mechanic messed up my truck they attempted once to fix the issue but the check engine light is still on and no one will return my call Joe totally messed up my truck messing up the knock sensor and the idle air control valve
Was also charged 47900 for a 33400 Quote  Check engine light on when I started my truck Code P0505 and P0328 Joe claims he did nothing wrong They sent out another mechanic Richard he determined that Joe had messed up the idle air control valve They replaced the IAC and reset computer 50 miles later check engine light on again They sent Richard out again and he said he didnt know what was wrong they charged me 70 and said it was not their fault He did not run the codes again if he did he would have seen that now the problem was in the EGR System code P0400 which he had removed to replace the IAC I have been trying since Dec 12 to speak with someone in management They have left my truck in a condition that will not pass vehicle inspection Original problem was a slight oil leak on drivers side valve cover Truck ran great and no check engine light Now I have a check engine light truck gets worse gas mileage and runs rough and it will not pass for me to get my tags soon Took truck to a real mechanic that 1st ran codes then found a vacuum hose loose that previous mechanic had left off What a joke
All Lies  I was charged multiple extra fees at the counter and if it were not for my exceptional negotiation skills and absolute unwillingnessrejection to pay anything beyond what was stated in the confirmation email from CarRental8  I would have been stuck paying fees or booking another car from a different company I had to present screenshots from confirmation emails that clearly stated taxes and fees to pay at pickup 000  DO NOT BOOK with CarRental8 or you will be another victim to their lies and deception Rental car companies who do business with this company should be ashamed of themselves
I ordered sports socks from the lifestyle sports website When I received them they still had the security tags attached and they were a slightly different version from the ones I had ordered
I brought the socks into the store and the staff were very helpful and removed the security tags for me but it was a nuisance to have to go in
I bought these socks in store previously and wanted to buy more of them The socks in the picture online matched the ones I already owned but the pairs I received seemed to be a slightly different model and dont fit as comfortably
I would be very wary of ordering from here again
I asked to order a product but was not asked for any personal details When I returned to collect the product I was told that the product was not there because I should have given my details but I was not asked for them
On the day of the purchase they claimed they have the product in stock but after the payment they simply disappeared and I had to chase them several times until they said that they have to order the product Nobody found important enough to inform us about this After several attempts I succeeded to talk to one of the sales guys that promised me next day delivery if I do not cancel the order and even a present for compensation however when the product eventually arrived after 8 days there was no hint of any compensation and nobody called me again to check that everything is fine and I am happy
Next time will think twice before ordering at Beachcamera
We rented the car in Auckland and returned it in Auckland We didnt damage the car whatsoever and when they were inspecting the car they said WE put a dent in the back of the car
We were shocked We absolutely DID NOT cause the dent and had NEVER seen it before for the entire 5day rental
They charged us 2000 NZD 1400 USD for the small dent with no paint damage Besides that tiny dent there was nothing wrong with the car and it cost us 2000 NZD You could remove it in five minutes with a plunger
Beware They blame you for their own DENTS and they charge you 2000NZD for it

You couldnt get worse service if you tried Rearranged delivery twice picking set time slots Turned up 4 hours earlier that agreed so of course there was no one home Lied about having been at the property and then tried to claim that I myself had requested to pick up the item from a depot more than 30 miles away from where I live really 
Dear internet retailers take heed if you want my business dont use UPS
After waiting a week for delivery and still nothing I cancelled the order and went to another shop that do not use DPD couriers
Products were not represented well
i just fill up the form that is provided after filling form i just put my card numbers after clicking pay now 404 error appeared and money was taken by bravofly as it shown in bank statement but they saying the money is not taken by their system nothing else i lost my money they steal it and nothing i can do because the bank says you just fill the form yourself so its your responsibility
Difficult to rate this as its the first time Ive used it I was wondering if the reviews get passed on the the various sites as I havent had much luck dealing with Marshalls seeds in person
ordered a product only part of the order arrived had lots of problems getting any solutions to problem had to returns items not happy
I ordered my tickets 3 weeks before the show and did not get my tickets until 7 hours before the show Made me very nervous because I had paid over 400 for 4 tickets with face value of 25 each I sent an email 3 days before show asking about my tickets and did not get a response Not sure I will put myself through this again
To follow a long list of unhappy people seems pointless as paypal have you over a barrel Anyone who has reviewed them as good are either someone who only pays using paypal or someone who stands to gain from leaving a good review I sold an item on ebay and sent it to the paypal address 2 months roll by and I think it must have arrived but no the seller contacts paypal and gets his money back so now Im down my item ebay fees and PP last time I use paypal or sell on ebay does anyone want to by a 750 100 positive ebay account as I may just sell it to recoup my losses
Paypal  maybe but definitely not sellerpal
I recurved 2 emails saying action required your booking needs immediate attention We were unable to process your credit card I got a different credit card flight I wanted was no longer available so I went with a completely different company and airline Then Flight Hub proceeded to take my money out and I got an email two weeks later saying your flight has been booked and your card was charged 14140 The next day after I tried to book it I used my card and only had 2 dollars on it but the charges and email didnt show up until two days ago I had to borrow money to get groceries and gas before I left town was short money I needed to pay a couple bills was in tears on my vacation stressing about costs and hadnt flown or taken a trip in years but did so for my best friend of 30 years wedding When I contacted Flight Hub the guy was rude kept saying well obviously your credit card DID go through and we will not refund your money I contacted my credit card company sent them the emails I received from Flight Hub and formally filed to dispute the claim and will be contacting the Better Business Bureau This was an absolutely horrible and costly experience for me I will tell all my family and friends NOT to use Flight Hub
When I had the cancell a flight last time people were not helpful and they kept giving me different information everytime I called
I called Customer Service with a problem and their unidentified operator listened and asked me to hold for a minute while he checked about a refund TWENTY SIX minutes later the line disconnected 
I had to cancel a flight through them  very picky regarding how it can be used and when Was on the phone for 30 mins in the process of using my flight credit when they asked what date I was going to travel and told me my credit would be expired Customer service reps are hard to understand and not very helpful
I shopped last week knew what I wanted and came back this week to purchase and everything I wanted was gone I like the prints that Kate is modeling they are also gone Its like false advertisement
Took two hours to get my flight changed then get a call and email 12 hours later saying it was more than they had told me and more than I was already charged for Absolutely ridiculous Cant get a refund Went directly to the West jet website and I can get the exact same flights for 300 cheaper Money scam Apparently there was nothing they can do Complete waste of money and timeIf youre looking for real reviews go to flighthub on Facebook I wish I had
I have used Ancestry for years Many years They really are a great resource for genealogy records
HOWEVER and it really is a BIG however
they are having some kind of a problem keeping the DNA site up and running
I should have three DNA profiles linked to my DNA profile and the extra two keep disappearing
Contacting ancestry is nearly impossible Their website deliberately does not give you the option of contacting them
Yes I have read their socalled self help faqs and followed all the directions and my DNA profiles are still missing
And this is the second time that has happened
I am not a happy customer and likely will not be until they get their DNA platform stabilized
We were to be collected  455 from Puerto Rico to las palmas aerport Nobody came We rang the emergency no and he said to get a taxi ourselves even though I told him we were outside a private apartment with no reception Gave us a local taxi no that we couldnt get through toit was a nightmare in the middle of the night Had to trudge to the nearest hotel with our luggage and they eventually were able to get a taxi for us Close shave with our flight Hold not recommend this company to anyone Desperate expierence and we are in our late fifties
Hi
I have a very negative experience with Comviq Be aware that if you owe them something they would not even send you a reminder although they tell that they do They will send your case to Kronofogden directly So you will need to pay huge fees and even can get a mark in your credit history for a 100 sek bill I was a customer with them for longer then 3 years And now I will cancel all my numbers with them so that they do not get a penny
The driver did not WANT to come today So its delayed again And no estimated hour of arrival
Impossible to change the delivery adress The parcel is still in the truck
Crap service over the phone
Their estimated time of arrival is a joke
I usually have great experience with UPS but this driver left the carpet OUTSIDE my gate on the highway side and heshe had the gate code right on the package Anyone could have taken it If I had not received notice that it had been delivered it could have been taken
Be warned they make you send them your personal ID before they will send you a card  even after purchase They make no mention of this before and will moan and fight with you if raise this as an issue afterwards
Not only that but youll be duped into signing up for all sorts of newsletters and email you didnt want
AVOID AT ALL COSTS

My meal was delivered at 330 in the morning the delivery driver woke me up in the middle of the night attempting to complete his work Who on earth would accept this delivery time
The food is lazy and uninspired and made of very cheap ingredients The amount charged for it is extortion and I estimate their profit margin to be over 900
Basically its the same 10 boring meals over and over with a varying sauce packet Everything is frozen which makes it mushy and not enjoyable

There Quote went up 50 from last yeari do realize car insurance is at a all time high but there Quote was ridiculous Especially when i was with them for over 4 yearsclaims freevery disappointing No loyalty and i will never go back to them never againVery unsatisfying customer here and Im going to let my feeling know to othersstay away
Your website is misleading regarding accepting insurance as the insurance I took out did not explain I needed more insurance otherwise my credit card would be debited 440000 if there was damage There was minor damage and now my money is being held hostage until the company actually has the car repaired and are invoiced by the repairer so no very unhappy
Warning to all other potential renters from this company watch out for the insurance option
They ask for a secury check via phone As I havent used paypal since 4 years my phone number changed There is no option to change the phone number or to have an alternative way of verification F this company
History sold a new 120 item on Ebay not for the 20 the buyer was trying for Had to contact buyer as street and postcode didnt match eventually I was able to ship yes alarm bells should have gone off Some time later buyer opens a case with PayPal not Ebay first stating incomplete item I offer to pay for screws they claim are missing but I dont accept returns Regardless PayPal witholds my funds until buyer returns item Buyer does not do so and case is closed Buyer appeals and reopens case Buyer changes story to item is damaged beyond use but will accept 50 refund they paid 70 originally but wanted it for 20hhmmmm They even tell Paypal I agreed Again Paypal close case as I dont agree to partial refund and buyer still does not return as PayPal instructed them to do All this goes on 2 months and Im getting abusive and aggressive texts and calls from the buyer and his wife mostly when they are drunk  never giving my number out again Eventually after a call informing me I better refund them or they will defacate on it before shipping it back I call paypal again and they tell me the drunks have appealed 4 times They promise me that they cannot appeal again as they are abusing the system I breathe a sigh of relief and move on Until
I get a courier notification that the item is being returned As PayPal have told me they have washed their hands of it Im not worried However its a bit quiet from the buyers end No illiterate messages Doesnt feel right
I check my PayPal account and it shows that something is unresolved yet it shows case is closed Im not too concerned as PayPal would have contacted me if there was an issue right WRONG I notice a comment at the top informing me that I need to contact the buyer to have my funds returned to me Confused I call Paypal for reassurance
PayPal have indeed refunded the buyer Despite their promise they gave the buyer another chance I believe she said it was the 7th appeal and this time they have actually provided tracking info However I have not been in to accept delivery and so the parcel is 40 miles away at a depot that I cannot reach dont drive Paypal know all this but have refunded anyway
This leaves several unanswered questions
1 Why was I never informed of ANY of the appeals  I found out about the first 2 from drunken buyer
2 How can Paypal have an appeal open without both parties being informed and given the option to act  there is nothing on the notes my end except for email to buyer after case originally closed  they havnt even logged my calls it just shows their end Apparently last appeal was opened because the lying buyer informed them that they had been in touch with me on another platform must have been 9 34 as it was complete fiction and agreed to it  why didnt they seek confirmation from me
3 How can PayPal just remove funds from my bank Paypal account was at 0 and not mention it either before or after doing so
4 Why are they telling me how to operate a returns service two months after sale despite my opinion on the matter
Today when I called in the first person confirmed all their failures and their theft of my money when they have not followed their own rules what else is it She then transferred me to a manager LauraLauren Anyway she also confirmed that PayPal had not followed its own procedures she could see the buyer had abused the system she could see I hadnt been contacted about the appeals or refund She said it was all wrong and shouldnt have happened but could offer me no advice other than to accept the return and appeal myself if its not as I sent it out
She could provide no help or explanation and when I kept trying to ask her rather than keep letting her spout the same useless confirmation of their failures she told me she would not continue with the call if I didnt stop interrupting So they steal my money but cant explain themselves and wont even attempt to resolve the issue unless I treat them with deference What was the point of her
This matter is unresolved and I will be looking into a different way of accepting payment other than via PayPal What I am left wondering though is what legal ramifications arise from PayPals enforcement of their policies on sellers when you consider laws relating to Restriction of trade which states it is the privilege of a trader in a free country in all matters not contrary to law to regulate his own mode of carrying it on according to his own discretion and choice but no power short of the general law ought to restrain his free discretion How does PayPal presume to be such a power that they can supercede this directive
I will never use this Company Again
They advertise with really low prices however the truth is when you arrive to pick up the car instead of a deposit they force you to make a bank transfer for a high amount only returning part left
Out of the around 1500 Euro i was forced to transfer I am still missing around 114 Euro which they refuse to pay claiming this is various fees etc etc
Do not use this company
Plastic for car seat had a rip As plastic is with daughter unable to return Very disappointed
it is sad that you guys changed I appreciate when you had to regular price upfront and when you applied the coupon you would see the difference and shipping should not be so expensive I used to buy from you alot but its not worth it after you get your so called discount and hike the shipping
The guarantee of tickets is 120  but what they dont say is that the prices are almost twice as expensive as the original tickets JUST because its prereservation I told them to announce that so if people really MUST buy the soldoutin10minutestickets they can pay extra to guarantee a ticket
It has been 5 days now I have been trying to get a response on my order Already I cannot get refunded because of their ever strict rather insensitive store policies No one is responding to my emails nor my calls and my card has long been charged for the items Whatever you do DO NOT BUY FROM THIS STORE SAVE YOURSELF I HATE THIS SITE DO NOT BUY FROM THIS I have discouraged everyone I know from being treated the way I have been treated
Had no window  as soon as I ordered was told it would be shipped the next day Got an email at 730 that it was on the way left for fifteen minutes to get lunch and missed the delivery by three minutes at 136 six hours later I called them immediately Got on hold for twenty minutes before being disconnected  only to call back for another ten minutes to be told that it would be shipped to a place 40 minutes away for me to pick up Will never waste my time with this company again Save your money and buy wine from a different company that has better communication and customer service

I love the shoes But I contacted customer service after I received a shipping notice that seemed strange and found out that a pair of shoes I orderedwere no longer available as my pair was defective I asked to have sale price applied to similar shoe and was told no and no apology I was never notified I called another time because my shoe showed online and placed order and then a cancellation notice came with no explanation I emailed customer service and got no explanation
Firstly I never had any bother from Argus Car Hire I changed my booking when a cheaper car became available and Argus sorted it out no problem
The problem started when I arrived at the Sicily By Car desk The queue was massive They had a semi  operational ticket system going where you had to pick a ticket and wait for your number At some points the tickets would run out and people wouldnt know they had to take one After a nightmare 25 hour wait at the desk we got allocated the car I had booked
After going to the collection point our car was still being valeted and we were told we would have to wait 1015 more minutes for it to be ready The lady from Sicily By Car was also not impressed by this she decided to give us a better car instead This was not her being nice She clearly said she didnt want people in her office and she wanted to get rid of us
I booked a ski rack to go with the car After checking the car for damage I asked the lady from Sicily By Car how the ski rack was fitted As she was walking off she just shrugged her shoulders and said Its magnetic I dont know Not very Helpful
Overall the car was good but the service was appalling If it wasnt for the good price we got from Argus Car Hire I would be giving it a 1

You sent me wrong coils for my mini wanted bvc ones you sent me the other ones had to go shop to get proper ones waste of time online too lazy to send them back
Due to the security issues of Yahoo I am not able to access my OWN email account I forgot my password as I put it in years ago My old phone number is connected to the account As I do not live in Australia anymore I have a New number My device however is still the same so they should be able to see it is me Trying to get intouch with customer service is impossible you get sent in a loop

Basically Yahoo messed up and now They take my account away
i arranged for a service and Mot for 22nd of Febuary today i got a call saying they couldnt arrange the service untill the 24th at 9amand i would have to drive car to the garage was this ok i asked where the garage was and it was over forty miles from my place of work i declined and cancelled the serviceabsolutely defeats the purpose of the site
Made cheaply and not what was described
I made the order February 4th for flowers to be delivered February 22nd That is plenty of time for them to get it figured out especially for a company that offers sameday delivery They didnt make the delivery that day and didnt even contact me until the next day to tell me they would deliver it the day after that 2 days late Then when it again wasnt delivered at that time I called to ask what was up and they said it would be delivered the next night and when I became audibly frustrated they just paused an promised me that the flowers had already been delivered within the past 2 hours Well you guessed it they werent So I tried emailing customer service since calling didnt seem to be getting me anywhere and the next day I found out that they dont deliver the specific bouquet to the address I provided so why did they allow me to place the order However if I wanted to pay 21 more they COULD make the delivery I said No I paid for those flowers to be delivered to that address so thats what youre going to do Apparently this was an impossible demand  to receive what I had paid for  so here comes the part where I give them 2 stars instead of 1 the guy says they can send a dozen red roses 15 greater value than what I ordered and then eventually makes it two dozen 85 more than what I paid for for my troubles In the end they almost made it right but the delivery was made February 28th 6 days after schedule for an order made well ahead of time and the item I ordered could not be delivered both inexcusable facts in my opinion So in short would I recommend Avas Absolutely not under any circumstance They were an absolutely terrible company to deal with but thankfully that one kind employee out of the 5 or 6 I dealt with was able to help me out Oh yeah and they say theyre a local company Dont be fooled theyre a national company who pays local florists a lower price than what you pay to arrange the flowers you ordered if youre lucky Do yourself and your local florist a favor and cut out the middle man It will save you a massive headache
I bought here and received a fake camera with broken support
Because of bad packaging
The support so far said to wait 3 days that would give an answer is already in 20
I never shop here again
And they asked to give a positive review here in exchange for 2usd
Goodbye tomtop
Hi sorry to say this but I am not satisfied at all I ordered some flowers directly on the webpage and there was a message that said available for tomorrow So I ordered for the next day of my purchase
The day that they were supposed to be delivered January 31st 2017 I got an email from you guys asking if I still wanted them for the next day February 31st 2017 because there were not availability I agreed and asked if they could add more flowers for this dela because i was my friends birthday You guys replied that you were sorry but it was a difficult one and that you would check because the florists usually closed on Wednesdays So I waited for the response and I just received the news that my friend already received some flowers that were nothing in comparison that what I tasked Totally different ones without asking me
I am completely sad about this situation and I woudl really expect you guys to send the ones I ordered
All the best

I made the wrong choice booking a car with AirportRentalsRedspot Rentals
I even rang on the phone and spoke to representatives of the company
From the very minute we picked this car up it was a mess
Two hours down the hiway into a 8 hour journey I found out I wasnt insured then told to turn around and go back Then I was charged twice the Quote d price to get insurance
It was a long expensive trip one I will not forget or repeat
NEVER AGAIN
Ordered prints more than 2 months ago in Jan 2017 still havent received it today with 2 full months passed What the heck is going on
Ive booked with Bookingcom many timesThe thing that I dont like about them is that you NEVER seem to get the room that youve seen on there web pages
Ive just emailed them three times askingIf I book a twin room at The Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool would it be one like the rooms in there web pagesAlso sent them there own pictures of the roomsThey dont seem to get there heads around the question and wont answer meThey just send me none relevant questions
Weve also had some VERY bad rooms from them which we had to ask for a change of room or refund

We incurred significantly extra costs when our elderly mum
was unable to hang up her phone properly when on your current Telstra plan  charging 15 min for this mistake  is totally out of keeping with why we chose your product  and inadvertent usage like when mum presses a name  makes a 5 sec connection and then hangs up  she again gets charged disproportionately for her mistake
KISA  NEEDS TO BE MORE SYMPATHETIC TO THE LIMITATIONS OF THE OLD  YOUR CURRENT TELSTRA PLAN STRUCTURE DOES NOT ADDRESS THESE OBVIOUS USER DIFFICULTIES
I bought a round trip ticket plus ticket protection plan with ASAP ticket service to Achilles
Achilles asap agent said that I buy ticket protection and what ever happen to me on my flight and my luggage is covered it August 3 2016 To February 172017 will be my round trip ticket I called him to say to rescheduled my flight again but he was not available so Evanderanother agent from ASAP Ticket service answered my call Since Achilles is not available at that time So I Talked to Evander then I said to him he could use my ticket protection plan for a re book because Achilles said to me that I could use my ticket protection without penalty fee but Evander said I couldnt use it Its not covered I have to pay 300 united airlines administrative exchange penalty 250 ITN Processing fee 35640 fare difference a total of 65640
he also said that I have to complete the form that he sent to me in next 2 hours and the seats are not guaranteed until the seats are booked I was surprised and Ive done nothing but pay for them to be rebook my flight because to not lose the purchased round trip ticket and ticket protection plan but I mistakenly thought When I call them again to adjust the date of my return they told me that I had to pay 8500 plus No one said to me that my ticket protection plan was null and no one issue me a charge break down Its more a scam I am extremely unhappy with their agents and services
In store experience was ok however the delivery and follow up was terrible We ordered the standard foundation with our new mattress but when delivered it was much too big I asked the delivery team how I can exchange for the low profile base and was directed to call the store to make arrangements When I called the store I left a message because they were busy with a sale I was told Id receive a call back same day I did not receive a call until closing the next evening At that time I was told I should have rejected the delivery and now I was responsible for delivery fee and an additional fee for the different foundation I called back later to try to speak with someone that may be more accommodating since the delivery team told me to call the store I ended up agreeing to the 100 swap fee but the store covered the delivery fee but I had to wait until the following weekend The following weekend they brought the wrong foundation so having learned from previously I rejected it and called the store again Left a message again to receive a call back the next evening Again To be given apologies and another autoschedule for the following weekend This now makes 3 weeks from purchase I was told due to the inconveniences I would be an early morning delivery but received an estimated time for late afternoon I ended up not being home when delivery showed up an hour later than window provided I called and was scheduled again for early morning Sunday only to receive an estimated time for mid afternoon I called immediately to inform them I would not be home due to other commitments to be told Id be added to the next truck departure in the evening I asked for an actual person to call me with my time frame to NOT receive one I called them at 3pm to be told I would not receive a phone call from a person but the autodialer would reach out I tried to explain my circumstances but was dismissed
Now after over 3 weeks later I have just received my correct foundation at 6pm in the evening never received my personal phone call but only the autodialer Bottom line I would not recommend Gardner White on the sole reason of poor follow up customer service
We bought a year subscription for their VPN service After 2 months Netflix starts blocking it on Playstation We talk to them and they manage to get it up and running a few days later But we constantly get disconnected They tell us to wait while they fix their services We wait a while nothing and they keep telling us to wait until next month So after 4 months of issues we talk to them and request a refund as they are unable to resolve this They deny us the refund as We used their service for more 6 months Though we barely used it for 3 month and they told us to wait until they fixed it
Would not recommend their services
Had to change in Frankfurt 1 hour delayed evreything was caos no information was given on the plane they sent us running to catch our connecion eventhoug they had already rebooked us for the next day

Your customer service is the worst experience Ive ever had in my life I was on hold with no indication as to whether I was on hold no music no noise no tone for two hours and never ended up reaching a human being I sent a message to multiple email addresses and customer service forms and nothing All I wanted to do was reserve a seat but there was a topic removed from their FAQ called How to reserve a seat that still shows up in search but is blank when you go to the page This is the worst
The original install kit sent to the place was in incomplete leaving me without a vehicle over the weekend The second kit was complete and able to be installed however someone elses paperwork was in there from a different state Only reason 2 stars were given is because the kit was there on Monday after missing my Friday appointment

This is a very nasty company that is very hypocritical and operates on a double standard model They destroyed our business by terminating our account without a valid reason and we lost all of our subscribers

AFTER 7 DAYS THE TOOK 650 EURO FROM MY CREDIT CARD AND BOTH CARTRAWLER AND AVIS CUSTOMER SERVICES DID NOT ATTENDED TO ME Now I informed a lawyer and I will denunce all of them to the police Pleas note that Malta Avis Budget already did this with many custoners as you can see from Tripadvisor website and they still have this on their website
Cartrawler what happened is a no damage receipt and a 650 debt on my credit card I already contact you and avis and no assistance from you Now I will see you to with the lawyer and the police
Ive been trying to get in touch with the Lastminutecom customer service team via email as I am unable to spend too much time on the phone during working hours waiting for someone of the customer service team to pick up the phone Ive spent plenty of my lunch hours yes sometimes a full hour trying to get somewhere with my query and now I wanted for someone to just ready my email and get back to me with an answer but they dont do that They avoid getting back to you via email so you dont have anything confirmed When you call everyone tells you something different and you end up with no record of what has been said by whom when or why Ive never come a across a company that has a customer service email and doesnt reply to it Last time I sent 5 follow up emails asking for someone to respond before calling and the woman on the phone said that she couldnt reply to me because she was off sick Worst excuse Ive ever heard Like there is nobody else who monitors emails Like someone mentioned in their previous review the call center has been outsourced to India and when you call up they just read from a handbook and dont care if your case gets resolved or not I have been told several times on the phone that they are sure they will find a solution to my query and they havent Very bad service Avoid at any cost and save yourself the hassle Im still waiting for someone to respond to my emaildays and days after

Be aware that they will withdraw a monthly amount of money from your account without noticing you It is not very clear that you have to pay a monthly amount for nothing after your purchase And to cancel your membership its not easy they make the task very complex for you If you are aware of that then its your choice Id not recommend it at all cost avoid them
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR SOMEONE TO RESPOND TO AN EMAIL I sent an email nearly a week ago with no replyHOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR YOU TO PAY ME FOR MY TICKET MANY WEEKS AGO Shocking customer service and company Do not use Ticketbis
Why I didnt found this page before I done a order with the pickupflowers this is the worst experience ever with my online shopping I make a order 3 days before Valentines day everything was going smooth until the Vday morning when i received mail that supplier doesnt have the flower but they have a different one I tried to call them none answer all the phones they have chat is useless waiting 2 hours and if you dont lost the connection they will not answer you the questions email none answering too so just waste the money and whole day because I cant find another supplier in end of Valentine day I hate them
Their customer service is a joke if you dont speak Chinese They will simply copy paste the same kind of messages Even after paying for the premium shipping my order 24489907 is stuck and they dont provide any help They will want you to check the post office and the customs Even if you request a cancellation they will ask you to first send the item back and produce proof that you have contacted the local post office and custom and have rejected the item with them
Doesnt it look fishy All the other reviews are total 5 star International shipping which involves a lot of factors and everyone is 5 star happy Not even Amazon can score all 5 star these days Think about it

I am a contributing writer for the website and was given a press discount which I have used for over a year On my most recent purchase I was told I was no longer eligible with no explanation The very least that could have been done was to honour the discount for the recent purchase and then for it not to be available anymore
I ordered a fpvfirst person view drone transmitter fpv goggles etc from banggoodcom on the 9th of December last year and Ive had nothing but issues since The FPV goggles still havent arrived due to being on back order despite receiving no indication of them being out of stock at the time of purchase and receiving an email on the 26th of December saying they were expected to be back in stock on 6th of January The battery charger I received for the drone batteries stopped working after seven charges After contacting customer support and sending on a video of the problem they proceeded to offer me 5 to replace the AC adapter for the charger This product cost me 1245 so I have no idea where they are getting the 5 figure from After declining this offer customer support hasnt replied this was nine days ago Ive also had other issues with their support such as when they contacted me asking was the delay with the FPV goggles okay I replied asking what was the alternative expecting maybe an alternative product or offer of refund Banggood simply replied with We will arrange shipment once the item restocks They have been simply terrible and unless rectified Id never order from them again
no exchange on products an you have to pay out of pocket to send wrong products back
I wanted to cancell my order 10 minutes after i placed it The woman i talked to was so rude and wouldnt let me cancell After an hour she said well now its sent anyway When i contacted UPS it still want sent but they didnt want to cancell it for me 2 days after i tried to cancell they sent it anyway and now im sure i will have the pleasure of dealing with them again when they get it back It is SO not worth it stay away
I have ordered from Eat Now a few times and usually everything is great However twice now I have made an order and the restaurant has never received my order because the machine was down
When my confirmation SMS never arrived I realised it must have happened again Problem is I paid via PayPal and now I have to go through the whole dispute process and wait 5 business days to get my money back
I think there needs to be a better way to let the customer know when an order hasnt been received
Fees are a ripoff
Site is deceptive
Originally told pram would arrive March 15th After numerous emails regarding travel delays still no sign of pram
Was told it would arrive today and hasnt
Would not order from them again
Ordered 15th Feb still have not received
The Trustpilot business model intentionally skews ratings so companies look better than they are
TP makes it impossible for individuals that have an experience with a company but do not pay for a service to provide their opinion These are usually cases where the sales process is deceptive or something else in the process makes it clear they would not want to do business with the company Any reviews that the rated company says are not from a paying customer are removed No recourse available
TP knows this They know skeevy companies are using their system as a promotional tool And they allow it to happen because in the end they care more about promoting their business than promoting trust
My badge is missing two stones
They DO NOT honor their promotional ad There are hidden exclusions not clearly mentioned
This year I decided I would change by usual tax prep services and opted for RG Brenner based on its promotions found when visiting their website
When I walked in and showed the promotion I was told It only applies to 3 tax prep services Yet referencing the image this is not stated anywhere on the coupon
Beware of this company  and their underhanded business practices
After writing this review I received the following message from the management of the company
name removed
Management appraised me of your claim that we did not honor the 50 switch save promotion name removed stated that even after he showed you the clearly marked terms of the promotions and the fact that you did not even qualify for the promotion in question we still honored it The min fee for that promotion is 99 which is what you were charged and what you paid However even after we honored a promotion you did not qualify for that wasnt good enough for you In no uncertain terms you threatened that if we did not refund you money you would leave negative reviews And you have followed through on your threats

Energised was very slow to collect my dad payment from bank so that Ingot late payment letters etcThe direct debit had been set up but bank informed me that it is up to the company to draw down the payment and they hadnt done soseems that one guy is sending late payment letters out and another guy isnt collecting the DVD from the bankcrossed wires somewhereI do not like to get late payment letters as I keep up to date with my utilities and alwYs have done for 50 yrsthe correlation between dad handlers and late payment handlers seems to be nonexistentThe causes hassle for customers
I waited outside the store for 30 minutes before I realized that there was a sign on the instide of the door with a phone number I called the number and the employee told me that he would be right there He asked us the unit size after showing them and we agreed to the 10x10 climate controlled for 95 per month and a 1995 first month After finishing all the paper work he told me that I had to purchase his insurance of which I told him I did not want to pay insurance He said that it was required I told him where was that on the Ad then he changed it to If I didnt want to pay the insurance then I would have to provide a copy of mine I provided a copy then he told me it would be 9500 for the first month I told him that it said 1995 and he told me only if I purchased his insurance I told him that it did not say that on the Ad and if it had I would not have come here I would have gone to a closer place He told I could go somewhere else which I told him I felt like he was trying to force me to by something I didnt want to buy I asked him to show me where it says that on the add He would not try to find out for me but after a lengthly back and forth conversation he then offered to pro rate the charge Of which I had suggested in the beginning when he told me my next payment was on the 1st I had told him it did not seem right since I was moving in on the 12th of which he replied thats just the way it was I agreed to the pro rate because I had already spent 3 hours on the process and could not afford to start over somewhere else It felt like an ugly experience

The turnaround of the support emails are to slow and have to keep chasing up It takes 24 hours to get a reply so this goes on for days and days
It might be time for me to look at a different and maybe I have missed a bullet on handing any money over yet
I even tried to upload some comments to their website click submit and nothing happens
I ordered 6 of the IGOW Plus RDAs which were updated in Feb 2015 What I received on March 1 2017 was 6 of the old versions of this tank pre2015 The product description did not inform me that these were old rdas nor was there any distinction made when finalizing my order or I would have cancelled When I contacted the company via email to express my dissatisfaction I was told you paid clearance price Send them back Very poor attitudes and customer service Will not buy from them ever again and I suggest you dont either

I have used paypal for years and am finally so fed up with them that I want to pull my hair out these guys keep screwing with my money and telling me there is nothing I can do about it I want to make a payment as I have done a hundred times before but their system security has flagged my payment and prevented it being processed If I was just trying to buy some stuff on ebay it wouldnt be a problem but instead it is a business purchase and I need to make the payment now
For two days their customer service team has told me that they have fixed the problem but it is never fixed I have called and called and called and every time I talk to them they tell me that that should do it or your ready to go now but its just a bunch of BS Its never fixed and they dont care that it isnt fixed one lady suggested that I transfer funds directly to my paypal account to bypass the security system too bad that takes 8 business days the Bith didnt bother to mention that even though I had quite literally just finished explaining the urgent nature of the payment
To summarize paypal is great on ebay but only because paypal owns ebay For everybody else stay away from paypal and dont ever count on their customer service team doing what they say they will For that matter dont ever count on paypal period It seems that they dont ever come through when you need them for the record this is not the first bad experience Ive had with paypal but it will definitely be the last
My flowerswere supposed to arrive yesterday and they didnt so I emailed them and asked where they were  They replied saying that a calling card was left by Royal Mail yesterday however Royal Mail emailed me saying they left the card this morning so the man from prestige flowers lied to me

I explained to your sales person that I had lost an arm to my amplifier and needed a replacement He directed me to a link to buy the large arms for the amplifier I bought them They were too big I needed a replacement to the original smaller arms Why did he have me buy the larger ones The when I brought to his attention that these arms were too big and that I needed the smaller ones he said I could sent the larger ones back and he would issue an RMA to replace the large ones with the small ones The large ones cost  699 return shipping on the large ones would cost the same So it would cost me about  14 to get the right ones that I needed In the mean time I found the missing small arm and now have a set of the large ones that I can either pay to RMA or just keep them and save the return shipping Whats the point of the RMA NONE What was the point of buying the large ones NONE You have idiots working in sales

We had two orders totalling about 1000 cancelled because as part of their checks we are required to call them which we did They asked for copies of our national identity cards no one anywhere does that even on all the major websites and right away an alarm bell goes off When we pay  we are required to go through a 2 step credit card authentication process and we dont see why we should disclose highly confidential details of our identity cards to anyone especially so on the Internet So after 2 failed purchase and a waste of time we are out for good Good luck tp you
I was placing order and I was given a coupon of 5 but when my browser got some issue I lost that coupon and then I couldnt get it back I tried to chat with chat support but no response

So had about 10 shirts I was going to order and had a question about theyre ribbed fitted tank top I selected the live specialist in watched as I was transferred to 3 different people without any of them acknowledging me or answering my question 10 minutes I waited it was utterly ridiculous
Ripped and tried to complain
Goldcar only responded after weeks
And peope who responded had no clue about the issue and were not empowered to make any decision
Company has made a business model out of ripping its customers

I bought and build the a3 2500mw laserengraver  I cannot get it to work on any of the software from the links they supplied  On benbox the laser stay on at full power  On eleks cam i can vontrole the laser manualy but when i try to engrave the laser comes on but it would not move on the axis  This is by far the worst thing i ever bought and i will not buy anything from banggood again  Thei is no after sevice and to retun the product is not worth it because of the cost i have sent them email on email but no reply  So their is no after service  My opinion is that they are out to make money by selling st stuff to people that trust them
The customer service Person I was on the phone with he was not knowledgeable of products and and he could care less about my needs as a customer I cannot believe I am reordering for the second time on DIORcom I told myself I was not going to but I do love some of DIORs COSMETICS thats the reason I ordered

Ordered 2 dresses hoping my daughter would like at least one of them Both dresses were a little big and looked way better in the picture than on my daughter She hated them both My fault  I didnt read the return policy prior to my order Much to my surprise and disgust when I started the return process I found out there is a 20 per item restocking fee in addition to the 8 cost for the return It ended up costing me 48 for my daughter to try on 2 dresses Never again
I ordered some flowers from Avas 10 minutes later a sales rep called me saying that a new shipment of flowers were being shipped and that if I could wait one day i would have a better quality of flowers I said that would be fine But then they told me that I would need to pay an additional amount for the better quality of flowers I instantly felt uncomfortable It was as though they called to try to upsale me So I asked them to cancel the order They supposedly cancelled the order But then I received a text saying that my flowers were shipped I was charged 109 bucks and was not supposed to be charged I spent two days talking to different reps and noone would help me I also noticed on my card that I was double charged So I spent another week trying to get my card credited back as well They finally resolved the issue but I wasted hours on the phone and weeks of trying to get my money back This was truly a nightmare issue and I would never recommend Avas flowers
Booked a trip a couple of months ago from Seoul to New Zealand with a stop over in Tokyo through bravo fly with the airline Air New Zealand that I have flown many times before to get to a wedding in New Zealand
Received an email saying the schedule had changed and my flights had to be changed after many emails back and forward got no real information
Then my connecting flight from Seoul to Tokyo was cancelled All I needed was the connecting flight to be changed so I could make the flight from Tokyo back to New Zealand
Bravo fly then emailed back stating I must contact Air New Zealand which I did and received the reply that it is Bravo Flys responsibility to make sure that the issue is resolved
Very nervous as I have to make it back to New Zealand at the time I had originally booked to make a wedding
As my flights are for late April I am hoping Bravo fly is able to resolve this issue and help better their own name with some quality customer service
I ordered and paid for a Elephone s7 over 2 months sgo and it still has not been delivered I have wriiten to the customer service section on three occassions and keep getting responses that its on the way I have since purchased a new phone in Australia
Will provide a review on the phone if it ever arrives
This is the first time that I write negative about somebody business but these people are not profeccional and are taking advantage of gullable people After buying and paying for tickets on line and receiving confirmation we received a call saying that this price is not available and that if we want still to fly we need to pay extra 200 otherwise they are ready to provide a refund They were very blase about this and tried to blame us as we argued saying we are not happy and are ready to start court process After looking into company we discovered that this is a small outfit running from Reading with no proper customer service or complaint department and I regret that we did not read negative reviews prior of booking
Ordered a car and added extra driver and Sat Nav Paid deposit and remaining balance was to be paid on car pick up Got email to say car ordered wasnt available and I was quite happy to accept car that was offered even though it cost more When I picked car up not only was it not the car that was confirmed but alsoVIP CARS had failed to to inform the rental company that included in the price was an additional driver and a sat Nav I had to pay the agreed price to rental company but they didnt have the sat Nav and extra driver was more too
When I informed VIP CARS of this they told me that the extras were not included in the balance when clearly they were as I sent them the proof from their own website and my confirmation Although I got a car I paid for extra that I didnt receive and VIP CARS refused to admit fault on lack of communication with rental company and refused to return my money for the extras paid for
They are a dishonest and disloyal company I will never use them again or recommend them Also was told by rental company that its not the first time they have done this to someone

Projector arrived Brocken and no reply from Tomtop
Still waiting 5 month for a reply and on Facebook page they said they can not do anything
Very bad experience with Tomtop
Product was delivered damaged multiple times I believe 4 times and then the product had a manufacturer defect and we had to go pick out new furniture They delivered the new stuff at a random time and they then used a marker to hide another defect At this point we let it slide because we had literally lost almost two full days of work in order to get the proper furniture we had ordered Overall not a good experience
At a glance it looked like 1999 and 48hrs when I received a mail to progress and asking for another 30 I was annoyed as they rightly pointed out they did tell me on 5 occasions about this charge but in much smaller print than the 1999 that stood out
Timescale was longer than expected also problems with o2 they said overall for me not a great experience
Please call813 520 9329
I order a pair of gray bathroom rug and your shipping sent me a single purple and white rug and then I had to turn around and buy a nother pair of gray rug and that really upset me so why should I pay for shipping mistake
I dont normally write reviews but I have been so appalled by how terrible this company is that I had no other choice
I ordered a bunch of roses to be delivered on the 15th in SG my girlfriend stayed home the whole day and they were not delivered
Their customer service is a new low in terms of terrible business experience for me Not only do they rarely if ever reply their english is absolutely terrible After talking with one for an hour I was left more confused as before
I have sent multiple emails but no reply
This is an absolute scam Ill wait for the flowers to be delivered this weekend otherwise Ill flag them as a scam with my credit card company

Really sought proper handling of my situation after they sent the wrong item Was very disappointed by the ten percent discount considering that it was possible to send the proper item
Bought a 27 iMac a year ago at 1995 yes I was that stupid to pay such amount in hopes for a well functioning Product without headaches Guess what The mac started behaving weird after about three weeks It started freezing and it only got worse and as I write this review its completely dead now I have been in tears on phone explaining the problem to apple I have spent timedays and weeks worth more than the price of the iMac  trying to troubleShoot the issue After about 12 months in agony I told them this must end now so I need to annul the purchase and buy another computer as my family couldnt live like this anymore It was at this point that they reffered me to a local repair shop I carried the heavy machine to the store who retained it for about a week and yet the problem wasnt fixed properly Apple has trained their workers to act like robots Therere no human understanding or feelings of any kind at all All you get is a very sweet hookerlike lovely voice who starts the conversation in a way as if they understand your problem but all you get is I can see youve been having the problem for a long time now Ill do my best to help you now Ill be the one to deal with this from now onwards Ill call you back On the other hand I even got a response like weve never got any complaints from anyone before Even if you know of any complaint then its a drop in the ocean compared to how much we sell without any complaints My screen completely failed and turned black three days ago I called in crying for help I received the usual robotlike response saying the problem is a bit too complicated so they would have to hear the opinion of the engineers who made the software and whole design of the iMac then theyd give me a call back latest the following day which was yesterday but one but no one has called me back yet and were at the end of third day Theres no cooperation with Apple Once theyve got your money for their overly priced products youre on your own Apple really sucks when it comes to aftersales services including customer care As said the sweet telephone voice only works when the issue is easily fixable Otherwise those who give more than one star in review of apple would regret it badly Now all I have to do is to file a complain to the consumer board authority and this may take all from six months to one year So where does it leave me I am forced to go and invest in a new computer while waiting for the case to be handled Apple is not even moved by this message from me Shocking indeed how a company of this size can treat people like crap while strapping us of millions NEVER BUY APPLE products unless youre sure itll work throughout the duration you expect to own it or unless you have too much money that you dont care about losing Because you will never see that money again if the product fails I mean NEVER You lose in all ways In my case I have already lost more than what I paid for the product  so even if I win the case with the consumer board Ill never recover the time spent chasing for it the headache along the way the documents lost during troubleshooting and reinstalling the computer the daily growing frustrations etc I have lost big time
Thought I was ordering a new product but it obviously is a refurbished or has defects will be returning it I can order the same thing brand new from amazon for 10 more
I placed an order on 030217 for flower arrangement to be delivered next day 030317 The arrangement I picked stated same day delivery available  After few phone calls and long email to customer service flowers finally were delivered on 030617  This is my worst ever experience with flower delivering service It is my first and last order with Avas Flowers Do not recommend it

I ordered a Gift Box set of two bottles of wine and two glasses as a Birthday Present for a family Member wine lover The wine promptly arrived but when I checked the contents
I discovered the wine inside was not as advertised it was a different year A quick check online on an independent review site informed me it was also a cheaper wine
I contancted wines online with my complaint and was told they would look into it
A week later I made a follow up call and was told yet again they would get back to me
It is now a further week on and still no answer Very disappointing Service from
Winesonline they have not inspired me to be a return customer
I was very disappointed that it was only at or possibly after I booked a hire car that I saw there was a limited daily mileage allowance and steep additional costs for exceeding it It will be restrictive but probably manageable Take care in selecting options assuming you can that you look for and avoid if necessary such a condition
inefficient awkward and time consuming
Its called Last minute yet it takes 24 hours to wait for a non confirmation Stay away
The accounting practice of falsely charging VAT and then claiming that no credit note can be issued because the selling artist has already been credited for the sale is pure nonsense It either shows a lack of willingnes to suppport a true customer concern or a lack proficiency
Will never do business with them again as the supervisors are rude customer service is god awful and they never resolved my issue
Not only we had to wait longer than expected to receive the items but we also had to pay bank fees for international transactions Worst part is the quality of the product Padding is extremely thin
Having on going issues with broadband for past 3 months this is very frustrating as I have e vision so no tv either I keep ringing customer service and each one of them tells me to do the same thing reset the box change modem etc they just want to get me off the phone as soon as I do it goes againits gone beyond a joke at this stage and I will not pay for a service that does not deliver I am switching to sky

I was concerned about baggage allowance on Airdolomiti a smaller branch airline I tried repeatedly to call FlightHub The automated phone line just ran in circles and I never got to speak to a live person I would not recommend this company and doubt that I will ever book through them again
After booking and paying 4 a trip the next day they said that we payed too late Whatdo u have to pay b4 the booking 
But they have been sooo kind that they have booked another ticketand we only have 2 pay 235 extrabecause that was the last seat on the flight
I cancelled and booked on another siteand strangely even that all seats where taken according 2 them it was no problem 2 get a ticket
What a scam
Why 2 starsWe got the money back
Edit Answering Travegenio
My problem is not only your 235 scam fee
After getting your mail about the extra fee I looked at momondose and booked on Air France site within 10 minutes since ur letter
Price 10 940 skr there where also other agencys that were cheaper
Your price b4 scam was11 229 skr scam  13 468skr
from the start of the first booking on your site  U where cheapest of allthen u had some extra hidden fees making u more expansive then Air FranceShould have stopped then  but was in a hurry
So not let u book saved me 2 528 skr do you think thats OK
I will never buy another part from this company The part I ordered was marked and stated it was for my application However when it arrived it clearly did not fit Somehow they shipped the wrong part When I contacted them to return the part all went well until it came to shipping They refused to pay for the shipping If it had been my fault I would not have questioned it When it is the vendors fault they should do the right thing They finally just stopped communicating with me I have told all my friends to use another vendor There are many with much better demonstrated customer service out there
They take ages to greet and complete the formalities Usually give older cars The rates are very high compared to any other rental car They make money on extras like full insurance road side assistance their fees etc especially if you have foreign licence Please check your final rate per day It will be very high compared to others The excuses they gave was shocking The agent Chris Elliot who is the duty manager at the Melbourne airport  said the rates are based on the cars available with them at that time and the demand He added the demand was due to Air show  that got over a day ago and the Grand prix  grand prix was after 2 weeks The agent made several mistakes on the invoice including the return dates and amount On top of it he send an email the nest day asking the car rego I spend too much with them Stay away if possible

I tried these Oliver Peoples frames on at a local store Then I ordered the exact size I needed on Otticanet Unfortunately the frames that arrived were a size too small even though they were supposedly a 51 I guess the sizes dont match up Not sure if these are counterfeit It didnt appear so But I cant imagine why else the size is wrong

Promoting and taking payment for items not available or any similar items available at that price
Website easy to use but it is only when you are at the end of the process that you realise a the car booking is not confirmed b the price is not confirmed and c the price will vary with exchange rate  so Ive given you all my private information and my credit card details yet have no confidence in return
And annoyingly there is no option to print or save as PDF once I have completed the process
Very rude over several conversations being cut off I was misinformed on stock availability and the staff where not helpful So i happily purchased the bulk of my goods from a competitor I only ended purchasing one item fron gym direct as i couldnt get it elsewhere I hope others have a better experience than i had One positive The item i ordered was delivered promptly
Bought a phone Ulefone Armor since the start this phone was faulty Very unstable battery turns itself off 1015 times a day not even exaggerating AUX port doesnt work properly
I was offered a refund by Banggood but I have to send the phone back I could agree with that however to send lithiumion batteries out of NZ you HAVE to send courrier 80
Banggood responded the post office had to drop the price as they only refunded up to 40 shipping costs
I responded to that email saying that usually companies arrange pickups of faulty goods and as they dont accept the price I was given by the postal services I was expecting them to arrange a pickup instead in this situation
Since then I did not get any replies
The phone was ordered on Preorder according to preorder the phone would be delivered before Christmas ended up arriving end of January I sent a email weekly asking for updates As Banggood was deadsilent and i was told on a few occasions to Just have some patience
Overal quality of their goods is low certain things are definitely worth the price but more often than not items are unusable as the quality is just too low
Worst experience I have had in my life you should not be in business close shop never got are car had to go elsewhere to rent a car
Dont process ur refund

It was late from order to shipping
It was supposed to be the price of the customs duty but the customs duty was taken at the arrival of the item refunded
Tired of phone calls from various solar panel companies trying to sell
I started with interest to consider getting solar installed and interest in government subsidies I did not expect the constant harassment and annoying sales calls
Dont leave your phone number I regret
On top of that they delivered a wrong product
This company is a SCAM  Wrong plant flower arrangement was delivered  AvasFlowers representative verbally admitted multiple times that what was delivered was a mistake but nothing was done to fix the issue FYI  Plant Flower arrangement was a JOKE Could have put the arrangement together for less than 15 and was charged 86 This was their PremiumLarge item too
Company admitted delivering the wrong item but did NOTHING to correct the issue and has kept the money
Please share so no one else is scammed
FYI  I guess one must never talk on the phone anymore GET EVERYTHING IN WRITING
I have made multiple calls to reach the sales person to speak on the order they did not include the sales person never answered any time though left my number with front desk
Also called for the broken leg for the fix they have come and said fixed but it still it is NOT They have damaged my ceiling while bringing stuff I need that be fixed Expected a call on this but I have not heard in this too yet

I ordered the roses for a special occasion They were delivered as promised on the due date However as one would expect they arrived really as large buds but all failed to open over a 7 day period after which they were visably deteriorating and dissappointed my partner immensly my contact with the company resulted in an offer of a 5 voucher for my next order however it would be pointless of me to order again as i would actually like the roses i send to open before they perish
People dont use this website It was created by people who are pure evils They sent my email to provider I reviewed  and told them that I left a negative review about them Just like a traitor would always like to put a knife in your back so is this website
I requested information about what i needed for an airbag helper rear suspension for a 6in lifted F250 The parts number given for the airbag assist would have worked since they mounted on the bump stop brackets attached to the leaf springs The spacers on the other hand were for an axel mounted system if i had of purchased this combo i would have an airbag set up that is lacking in structural rigidity due to the lack of reinforcement of the bump stop bracket and a waist of 100 due to have useless spacers Overall the only thing that kept me from making this mistake is my own research and more through review of the installation instructions you provide on your website So thank you for those I think the guidance was given based on a computer programmed response and not so much the person Yes this approach of standardized problem responses may improve response times and cut costs for training personnel However they do lead to these mistakes not to mention you run the risk of a detachment of the company from the customer which inevitably causes a loss of customer loyalty Thanks for the help though your website has a great selection of products
I paid nearly 600 for a rocker recliner from GardnerWhite Warren store Less than a year later the cushion I sit on is breaking down badly and a spring is squeaking loud enough that either its broken or preparing to break When I contacted the company by email they offered to fix it for me but I would have to pay their standard service fee as well as any parts needed I understand its not under warranty but a chair thats less than a year old shouldnt be breaking down the way it is I have another rocker recliner older from Art Van that was given to me several years ago and is still holding up mechanically When I compare the 2 chairs theres no competition Art Van wins by a mile
There are no pictures of the actual item your buying The item in received was in poor condition considering the price I paid for it
Im not happy the condition of the item
Took me two days of missing work to get my matress delivered to my house and this is after the fact that the mattress I purchased less than 6 months ago ripped at the seams Dont think I will be shopping here again
Do not shop here Sent me a damaged item and then charged me to return it Charged me for the replacement but never sent it Trust me its not worth the stress Use another seller or preferably a US department store bc these ppl do not value their customers
The garage were great but I was misled and when it came to paying was offered 25 off next service but not told I would have to pay for that Just poor paid for a diagnostic and not given information about it afterwards just still had problem

Unprofessionell
Didnt like it too sweet fake sweetness and within a half hour it left me non voluntarily All in all I did not consider this very good or refreshing
Online return processing took so long Ive contacted customer service they kept on telling me it takes 1015 days to process but I dont get any email confirmation nor a refund for almost 3 weeks now
The company didnt follow their own policy and procedure Customer service gave empty promises and lacking of problem solving
This is definitely will be my second order and last
Such a disappointment

While searching on Travago for 2 rooms in Washington DC Amomacom came upthe room was cheaper than any other siteso I went to book itEvery time I pushed continue to get to the next page the price jumped up I had my friend on the phone as I made arrangementsso I was distractedbut we needed the roomso we agreed to go ahead and bookby the time we actually booked it was about the same as the others When I got the email confirmation they had charged me an extra 53 for using my credit cardRight on the first page of the booking process it stated no fees for using credit card I called and they did refund 53after quite a lot of discussionI had to email a screen shot to the agent to prove what it said on their site There is morethe statement given at the hotel was for almost 500 less than we paid I emailed Amoma when we got homebut they never replied This site is not reputableavoidthey seem cheaper but in the end they are more Two points to be clear 1 The first page of Amomacom CLEARLY stated NO fee for use of credit cards2 Amomacom charged me 1773 for 2 rms3niteswhen we checked out the statement from the hotel was for1298I dont mind them making a profitbut 30 markup 
I have two cars insured with 25 plusone of which has been insured with them for about 7 yearsup until last yearI was delighted with 25 plusThat was until they started jacking up the price of insuranceThey refused to give me an explanation as to why my cover increased above the average rise stated by Insurance Ireland 33 in one year to be exactThey waffled on about the rising cost of insurance but for the last two years have refused to actually put any explanation in writingAs soon as you push them via the messaging service they Request you a callbackThis year they wouldnt deal with my issues via the messaging serviceand at the same time wouldnt contact my husband on the number i suppliedeven though they have dealt with him on my behalf for years and have the required consent
Its impossible to make contact direct by phone which is infuriatinglike so many people i am trapped by the ages of my vehiclesBut should the Irish Government grow a pair of balls and put manners on the Insurance companysi would move policys to a company that actually appreciated customers who have showed them loyalty
Had to make several attempts at registering as there was a problem having both my house phone and mobile numbers accepted I kept getting the message that I did not have enough digits but persistence payed off and I finally got my registration
It really saddens me to give a bad review but I do not want anyone else to experience this frustration either If you are a bigger girl like me you love finding new plus size shops I found the perfect dress for my wedding reception through Pinterest for the Sammy Dress site The payment went through and I got an email stating they would let me know when my dress had shipped It is now 12 days later and I have not received any shipping confirmation Even Walmart will tell you when they have delayed shipping Come to find out there is NO 1800 number to call and you have to write a ticket in order to communicate back and forth It is a huge headache and waste of time I did receive a response stating basically they sold the dresses before they actually had enough of them to ship So my dress will be shipping in 715 more days Oh boy

We have had an account with initial for years without any issues It is only this year that we have experienced such terrible customer service having ordered mats in January from a sales rep and received the wrong order twice we are still waiting on the correct order We also received the invoice prior to any delivery and a follow up phone call looking for payment
ordered 3 13 now 3 23 and still have not received 5 pairs of earring
Took forever to get my order because they shipped to my old address even though the order confirmation showed proper address
The Salesman Kyle Nash at the Brighton store was really good The delivery service was poor During the setup on Friday 3317 they realized that they were missing the center support piece and one of the feet for the drawers They told my wife that the warehouse didnt put the items on the truck They then told my wife that they wouldnt be able to deliver the missing pieces until Tuesday 3717 even though she overheard one of them on the phone saying that we arent going to do it Saturday we will do it Tuesday They proceeded to tell my wife that we could us the bed without the missing support piece but to take it easy since for prolonged usage would bend and crack the slats platform style bed without the support piece Then they left They also left small pieces of styrofoam all over the floor and left whatever is used to wrap the drawer handles on the handles Extremely unprofessional and fortunately for you the missing pieces were delivered Friday night after I called customer service Even then the men who delivered the pieces Friday night were not told what they were supposed to do They didnt have any tools with them and I had to supply them with what they needed Not sure what kind of outfit you are running but this makes me not want to shop at your stores again If it wasnt for the Brighton stores salesman Kyle Nash I would have given a 1 star zero if I could rating You can believe I will inform all people that I know of the miserable experience that I have received from you
All other sites that give you Quote s give you the TOTAL price you will pay at pickup Rentalcarscom gives you the hire price Youll find that all the excise taxes and other fees will be added on AFTER you go to pickup your car I prefer to know what the TOTAL will be before I pickup and this is the only way to truly compare prices offered by other sites and avoid costly surprises My first and last Rentalcarscom booking
The product I reserved and the price were not the ones I was charged at AVIS The people there were also very slow and disorganized not able to explain why the price was 3 more than double
Thought I was ordering from a local florist near my relatives home Nothing but problems with ordering process Was on the phone over 1 12 hours through the day trying to get the delivery corrected One call lasted 53 min God bless one custservice repShe barely understood english yet she tried to help In the end it took three different supervisors to fix the problem Flowers were great though
Was not sent a complete redemption code
Ordered flowers for a very special event Never delivered Excuse was blamed on local designer Disputed charges with credit card to get a refund Very disappointing Ruined a very special moment
your staff didnt tell me one of my production has been sold out then sent me the parcel directly
The worst service experience I got email and text confirming that my transaction was successful on Dec 2 2016 More than a month later no money in my Indian account One rep told me that Remitlys partner bank reversed the transaction for unknown reasons and they have sent an email 3 days ago to inquire about it 2 hours later another rep sends me an email saying my bank has rejected the transaction for invalid account 2 previous transaction via Remitly to same bank and same account were successful and this account is active for more than 15 years They do not have answers to my questions and everytime I just get an email to be patient while they are looking in to it ITs BEEN MORE THAN ONE MONTH THEY HAVE MY MONEY WHILE I CONTINUE TO PAY INTEREST ON THIS AMOUNT The transaction on their web has now changed from Successful to on hold waiting for information from me They are still waiting for a response from their partner bank RIDICULOUS
I ordered four LED light bulbs with clear understanding from website about free shipping when typed in SHIPFREE coupon code I did just that However final order page reflected shipping charge and there is no way to cancel order or exit out It was too late to contact customer service at night so I was forced to pay the unexpected shipping charge I hope there is a good explanation for this deceitful advertisement
It would be better if certain settings could be locked down as preferences I dont see how to do that The back to top button is always in the way I keep getting sent back to top when I try to click scroll down on the right of the browser
If you give a review to warn travelers about bed bugs in a hostel they will delete it saying that its against companys policy as it might close hostels business down
What about customers that trusted your reviews That one main review any traveler looks for no one wants to get bitten and have these creatures get inside his stuff
They lost their integrity and never trusting them again with any bookings
Paid for a suite but ended up with the smallest room in the hotel Have used bookingcom for years with no issues at all Use at your peril 
I really like all the items I have received from Fabletics but the website is awful I first thought maybe it was my browser since I was initially using my phone I tried on my PC at work  it only got worse Then I tried at home on my mac and it was awful  but slightly easier to navigate
It seems like the idea is having people scroll to the rightleft to view all clothingaccessory items is different although it doesnt work
I would prefer the webpage to display clothing in a topbottom format like it used too
Also if you are trying to use the drop down menu all the text is overlapping and its nearly impossible to see which category you are selecting
Just in general disappointing because the items are cute and durable  but sometimes I cant even get to them on the website
Got to the game and we could not use the tickets by electronic bar code Thankfully the venue had a printer but we had to walk everywhere to find it We were worried for a minute that we wouldnt be able to get into the game
Payment failed through your web but successful through paypal Showing the error is security code but I entered twice and was right
They gave our reservation to someone else Told us they called but never did

There are 3 carts at the Oakland location and hundreds of storage units This creates a hunger games type atmosphere upon arrival This is a huge deal since the location has crackheads buzzing around and you cant leave anything unattended for even a moment
The maintenance guy smokes Im the building so it stinks
This weekend I bumped into two ladies who I assume live in the storage unit during since they were wrapped up in blankets charging their phones and looked at me as if I was invading their space while I searched for a cart
Get more carts Get more carts Get more carts
Thanks for the response but I can confirm that there are not 6 carts at this location
I have had these before in the stores many times before they closed down and they were always excellent But these were dry and besides being frozen upon arriving they just didnt taste good

Very confusing changes  I used to be able to book directly withy the hotel and this time I could not the end result is that I dont know for sure if I have one or two reservations and I now have to pay an EXTRA 1299 to make the reservation online My account was also charged immediately and I dont think that should happen
I sent Brand new book in and you never paid me for it
Selling defects very bad experience
Ive purchased and payed for an article and after all done and Information email received got an email stating that what I bough was out of stock and that Id have to wait Should have been offered the chance of refund
I sent a text message asking about how to return and that I didnt know what size to reorder because their measurements were
Completely wrong I still have not had a reply
Phoned four times about a flight that was cancelled still unresolved after 2months Airline do not have my flight details or have the flight last minute has offered in place of the cancelled flight Still without flight or information and prices of flights have gone up with other airlines Have been on hold over an hour with reluctant mananager contact Appalling service and shortly I shall be taking this to social media and ressolver as Ive had to constantly phone companies to find out about my flight Passed on from one person to another being falsely promised for call backs which Ive never once received Was told airline havent responded after being called and emailedat what point will they realise the company wont get back to them The day before my travel day Havent been able to plan or book hotel due to this and prices are constantly increasingnot happy and will never book flights through them again Customer service so infuriating keep getting told my issue is being escalated how far does it need to be escalated before someone realises that this flight isnt available Constantly told to wait 24hrs 48hrs and recently 72hrs and it will be sortedSTILL WAITING Beyond frustrated
I completed my order with the new VIP items and the 2 for 24 items and I was charged full price plus charged for another set of two leggings 6 items in total and all full price for 16600 had to call and cancel order my debit card was charged and then I had to wait for the credit to take place on my card poor operating website
service was very slow as well as delivery was over two weeks
The image output is lower quality but usually decent enough so I can use it for quick output The customer support however has left me high and dry There has been a twoday system wide login outage meaning you cant login and use your account You also cannot call support because you cant login and only actively logged in paying members can call I had to hunt and peck to find out what was going on to find a relatively obscure listing for the known issue in their support forum When I submitted a support ticket to request status updates and be notified when the service was up and running again I received an inadequatelazy response from support rep who then closed my ticket as resolved He advised me that I would have to keep checking back to the support forum to get any info or updates done end of story No email to customers about the issue no updates no indication as to when the service may be available so I can plan accordingly wasted my time and affected my client workflow Would NOT recommend PAID  UPGRADED PREMIUM PLANS for any real application it would be fine if youre just using for fun Bottom line do not pay for this the company is not functioning at a paid service level

I just booked two seperate flights on FlightHub for myself and my boyfriend The price Quote d on the website at the time of booking was 106051 I had taken a screenshot of the purchases to show by boyfriend the deal I had found However when the transaction was processed the price we were both charged was actually 117851 This is a price difference of 118 each There was no popup to prompt me of the price increase before accepting the charges I found that very misleading as I was not notified of any price increases prior to confirming the purchase After contacting customer care I was told there was nothing they could do to rectify the situation as the prices come from the airline I had even sent them the screenshot of the lower price and they said they could not use that as evidence because anyone can fabricate the price in paint or photoshop I was furious I will not be booking through a Flight Hub again

Hidden costs of 1360quid for seat reservation Utterly disappointed will not use again Booked through Expedia and because KLMs prices are not like those low cost airlines I was not aware of hidden charges for seat reservation
This is shameless  why dont you just include the fees in your tickets if you charge everyone Yes you can get it for free 30 hours before the trip but you are adding extra pressure for travellers without warning them in advance Such a highly priced airline I paid 1000 pounds for a return journey to Asia but acting like a low cost one
Will go back to Emirates  much more honest at least no hidden charge for seat reservation Will spread the words too
Unfortunately for me I left my travel arrangements with our admin and she made the dreadful mistake of booking with Goldcar through one of the prise comparison websites I realized very quickly that there is something wrong when at the collection desk I was offered the options of 1900 deposit 200 or 250 is the usual rate with Avis or Europcar who I normally use or special insurance of 70 and still an excess of 200 At this stage I was about to go to another rental company but apparently had to pay a penalty of 70 for not collecting the car which almost made me laugh At the inspection of the car the guy was trying to rush it as much as possible assuring me that there wont be an issue if something gets missed and even at couple of scratches they havent penalized people for Unfortunately for me I missed a small scratch on the external mirror which wasnt visible due to the sun and white plastic I only noticed it when we arrived at the hotel but didnt really think much of it Only when I returned the car I was pleasantly surprised with a bill for 440 including administration charge of 150 loss of use40 etc Despite all the arguing and two additional witnesses I was given the option to pay the 400 or not get the 1900 deposit refunded or continue arguing and miss my flight  On top of it there was no one at the company desk to complain to
Clearly a company I will never use and highly recommend the same to everyone
PS  I just spoke with my bank and apparently they are already under investigation by MasterCard
In just a nanosecond after submitting a comment requested about apparently not from or by a particular vacation rental experience I just had completed I received a confirmation email welcoming me to the trustpilot family and asking me to promote them Well its difficult to know if one should now trust trustpilot

The sales person was good the car was nice it has simple problems was minor told the warranty would fix it  alignment issues  push button key problem is fixed make shure if you by anything there make shure its fix before you buy it cuz you are one mile over you are stuck with it the warranty company is a joke only pay for repairs 100 dollar deductible at cheap places when I voiced my problem with silver rock the drive time manger MANAGER said  then why did I buy the car then now Im stuck with a car with a crappy warranty for 5 years at high interest  no other choice  dive time and silver rock prey on people with bad or little credit but its the only way most people like me can get a car in all Lindsay was great the guy that signs the papers with you was nice was a pleasurable experience untill the warranty company got involved
Nice paste and post comment there nobodys fooled you care nothing expt that I make my pmts on time nobodys fool with that generic response
I signed up for the trial still never got any results Called to cancel through voice automated system as it suggested but then the 99 still came out of my account which deemed my cable bill payment unable to be withdrawn causing a late fee for me and bank fees Upon calling and waiting for live customer service I had to wait on hold with loud music in my ear for 23 minutes before someone answered As I started explaining the reason for my call the Rep immediately got defensive and displayed major attitude throughout the remainder of the call I will never use them or refer anyone to them
i pick up the sign myself just in case delivery will damage it  after i open it there is 7 dents on the top of the sign
Since the website was updated Bundle Stars is a mess with LOTS of friction compared to the previous version Before buying something took a few seconds without having to log in now it takes so much time I often dont even buy bundles I would buy without hesitation with the previous website
Ideally Id only have to get to their page click buy give my email address and get to Paypal nothing more then just get keys by email Now I need to add to cart remember what email addresspassword I used on that site go through annoying captchas deal with the redirection issues I get on every single log in open my cart again click buy and finally get to paypal but even after I still need to go back to my account and find where the keys are
I placed an order two weeks ago and I am still waiting I had to call to see what was going No email no notice I have been Ordering for about 7 or 8 years now I AM VERY VERY DISSATISFIED It is in backorder and now I have to wait another 2 weeks A MONTH AND A WEEK TO RECEIVE MY ORDER
Opti contacts apologizes for this mishap however you are not selling shoes or purses you are selling a contacts and glasses and this as far as Im concerned is a necessity I dont resolve anything with your apologies If you wanted to help after a two week back order disaster such as this upon receipt you should send it to your customers overnight THATS how you apologize for the inconvenience Again I have been a very long time client and it is the least that you can do The truth of the matter is that your customers dont mean anything to you
Not satisfied We have a bad experinece Delayed delivery My order is different from what they delivered Never to order again in your site Theres no response from my inquiry
Everything my size was pit of stock Literally every legging Capri pant was sold out in my size I had to order up a size Then it took 86 min to checkout It kept saying my zip code was wrong I know my zip code One of the most frustrating online experiences ever If my wrist wasnt broken and I could drive to get pants I wouldnt order from here
No issue on placing orders The issue is substandard food items which were uneatable
I booked a flight today and when I started it was 335 and 2 minutes later when I was done booking it was 476 I think I when you click on a flight it should be reserved at that price while you complete the booking process Not impressed but was travelling with others who had booked the same morning and wanted to be on the same flight so really had no choice
Not a lot of friction but an inadequate experience
Having used Easy Signs previously I did not hesitate in using them again
By not following a simple instruction they were responsible for our signs not being at an important club event where it was important for sponsors to have high visibility
Additionally I was promised some information dimensions of package so I could organise alternate shipping which were never received
I will use Easy Signs in the future because their product is very good However I am very disappointed in our latest interaction

I rent cars in Palma Mallorca around 12 times a year  I have a large property rental business there so thought I knew every trick in the book the car hire companies have so Im just to let everyone know of Goldcars latest that even I did not spot
We all know there is a refuelling service fee to pay that is the norm now it seems Their fee is 26 Euros and Record Go is 24 Euros for example However when I hired last month they stated at the desk it was now 59 Euros In my hand I had the Goldcar terms and conditions printed off from doyouspaincom on which site I booked the car The terms clearly stated the refuel fee would be between 1929 Euros for this car At the desk they said they were not valid TCs as I was now dealing with Goldcar As usual at 9pm at night you just have to accept and challenge later which I have tried to do in endless emails The desk clerk even said what do you expect when the car hire is so cheap we have to make money somehow
In recently email exchanges they have advised that indeed the fee is 26 Euros but the extra 33 Euros I was charged was because I took a diesel car and I should have declined a diesel at the desk I did not choose a dieselI couldnt care less what type I have I was not made aware of a new diesel car using penalty at the desk and because I signed the contract all in Spanish it was as it was
So be very careful about this if you use this company from Feb 2017 Always book a petrol decline a diesel if offered 59 Euros is a rip off for a service fee Its a shame as I traditionally recommend my dozens of annual rental clients to them That has now been taken out of our 2017 suggestions feed to guests
Im sure Goldcar will reply to this with a you signed the contract which indeed I did I guess I was just stupid to believe the Goldcar terms provided on the site I booked on believing they would be honoured at the desk

Ive purchased a few things from Sportbike Track Gear over the years including Pirelli Tires and Alpinestars boots without issue So when it came time to get a new pair of gloves I figured go where you know the service and prices are good So I purchased a pair of Danise Druid D1 Long Gloves figuring they were in stock since the website didnt show anything different and they offered free shipping After placing my order I was sent an email stating my order was shipping out of Italy and it would take OVER A MONTH to get them Since its still winter here in the North East I let it go figuring I wasnt doing a ton of riding this time of year anyway However I feel there should be some sort of alert on their website Like Revzilla does letting customers know that the item will take a long time to ship If this had been in the middle of the ridingtrack day season and I needed the gloves right away I would have been extremely upset
it took so longer than I thought due to the payment error I wanted to get the rings about Valentines day for in one week from the day
I sent a checking mail at the day of payment error than after some days I received answer which was friendly by the way asking me to send banking record for the payment It already took about 2 weeks I am glad I receive your products in the end and was satisfied with them yet it could have been better if the payment error wouldnt have taken so long
I suggest for your website to make a sort of guideline for payment error Like the record of my banking account should be added in the mail so that you could reduce steps and also time
When did you decide that because I bought some books from you I am now willing to do your quality control for you

We bought a Neilpryde Zephyr from Wiggle and it arrived damaged due to insufficient packaging To be fair the courier mightve been rough with the parcel so not blaming Wiggle too much on that What happened afterwards with customer service was a nightmare
We first contacted Barnaby who transferred us to Louise and then over to King L sorry if Im missing anybody We wanted to exchange the damaged bike with another and at that time they still had 5 available in stock We made it real clear to have them reserve one for us In the end it took close to 1 month of chasing them down with emails to finally get a return slip their replies were VERY SLOW and usually took around 3 days to hear back from them andthey told us that the order had been cancelled and that we would be given a refund WHAT We asked for an exchange not refund Their reply was that the bike was now out of stock Errdidnt we say to reserve one for us a month ago
They sent us another email about our refund and they had the nerve to refund us the amount for the bike only and not the shipping costs I had to hunt them down once again and after speaking with Harry and then Ardita we finally retrieved everything that was rightfully ours in 3 separate payments minus my time and effort Truly an awful experience and first time ordering from Wiggle too Never again

I did two orders 40099379 and 40100179 and used same credit card and all other information I not used any Verified by visa password for both orders They processed second order and asked pay for first order Western Union that I had no any buyer protection and they so easy could scam me I refused and told I want pay via credit card for have buyer protection Then they told ok use for first order Verified by visa password like you used for second order They are crazy I not used for second order Verified by visa password because I have no any Verified by visa password at all I have written to them about it and then they stole my second order too I try 5 days solve situation but I have feeling that support it is or bot or spit on clients They write same info many times and not read client messages at all If they will solve case I will change me review but for now they are seems like big scammers
The car was very expensive The price was around 50 euro per day for a small car Citroen C3  The price on internet was 73 euro for 7 days without insurance Super cover Normally price for Super cover is about 1520 euro per day approximately 200 euro in total for 7 days
around 30 euro per day when I rent a car on the Canaries islands
I have tried to explain my complaints for the personnel at the Gold car rentaloffice at the airport Tenerife South But they did not listening to me After some discussions I really understood that the certainly not care
So I left the Rentaloffice very disappointed determined that not rent a car from Gold Car again
My order arrived two days later than the estimated time of arrival not very good
My package went missing for over a week without explanation There is also no delivery date estimate on the website it just says it will be sent within 12 days I assumed that the package would arrive interstate within four days or so Not the case More than 2 weeks later it arrived after many phone calls trying to locate my package The customer service person was as helpful as she could be but couldnt tell me where my package was or when it would arrive I wont be using this service again
Flew to Tenerife South airport on 26217 and picked up the prebooked car from them The car was not the model wed requested and had quite a bit of outside damage but also was not full of fuel as it should have been which we didnt realise until wed driven it away The car was fine for the week and we returned it in the same condition we picked it up Only difference was it was brimming over with fuel you couldnt have got another drop in it It was checked by their advisor and she said she was perfectly happy with it and the deposit would be returned She specifically checked the fuel gauge and said nothing apart from it was all good NO mention of it being short We have just checked the credit card and found that Goldcar have taken 48 euros 8 euros for fuel shortage and 40 euro fine Absolutely disgraceful If it was supposedly short how come she said nothing at the time They now want us to make an online claim and provide evidence of the fuel purchase How many others have they been ripping off with this scam My advice DO NOT hire a car from Goldcar if you do take photos of the fuel gauge and mileage before and after hiring it Do not be a victim of this blatant lie Will never use this company again Have hired from Sixt on previous holidays will be going back to them in future Hang your heads in shame Goldcar your staff are a disgrace
I used this site for about 4 trips 2 went off well But the last one was pretty awful The customer service here is indifferent I needed to reschedule a flight bc of a family issue No help given the cost of the new flight was equal to the other flight and so I paid twice Understand that this may be airline policy but the service was so unwelcoming and abrupt it was as though I was inconveniencing them Booked and confirmed return home seat Once at gate my seats were not only different but all the way at the back of the flight twenty rows further back than oriiginally Directly across from bathrooms instead of a window seat Customer service gain dismissive gave me a 14 credit Again not so much the details as the service itself thoughtless and indifferent Wont ever use this again Stick with booking directly with an airline or hotel This company sucks
I requested on 6 occasions over the last two days to confirm if flowers were delivered and I still have not got answer 
I find that the vouchers dont come in the values to suit me
Very bad support they deactivated my account and refuse to reactivate them with incoherent excuses I have email captures and tests of mail they have to believe me the support is bad they do not help me to recover my account nor my balance
This is the phase of excuses that have put me
They ask me why I have so many transactions and it is obvious why I have made many cashbacks
I had created multiple accounts just because I had forgotten the mail now the support refuses to help me recover my account WITH POSITIVE BALANCE
Bad support I have nothing more to say they do not help they do not cooperate they do not reactivate my account I wish everything was different
Be careful when making many purchases the bracket is sly bad and thief
Now a few moments ago the support is asking me for my ID or passport to confirm my identity something that is totally illogical inconsistent without help
I hope this does not happen to anyone else
Asked sales rep to confirm details of booking these were incorrect Asked him to cancel booking stated that it had been processed although we hadnt authorised it
He hung up and transferred us to the switch board We got through to a customer service rep provided him with the details that we booked with and he states that there is no record of any booking
I called my bank and WE HAVE BEEN CHARGED
I am outraged

Although the companys representatives are very responsive when you need to email and call them ordering issues far outweigh this benefit I would not need to email and call them so often had my order which I placed in November arrived when it should have We were told it would arrive the first week of February No such luck Then we were told it was because of the Chinese New Year that the order was delayed and it would be several more weeks The Chinese new year is not a surprise It is on the calendar every year and should be accounted for After several more weeks passed I called again to check on the order and was told it has still not even shipped out of China yet Now we are looking at possibly the second week in April I wouldve ordered from somewhere else long ago if they had kept me updated on what was happening and I didnt have to keep investigating on my own
They didt unlock instead they charged more than what I have to pay Firstly they will ask you to pay 28 dollars later they ask to go premium service as your phone IMEI is locked with ATT THE MOST PART OF THIS FRAUD IS REVIEWS ALL THE REVIEWS ARE FAKE THEY ARE NOT CUSTOMER RELATED
Took forever to arive and for tracking info to appear
Still waiting after 3 months

Booked with Norwegian Airlines three months ago and was very excited about my trip to New York
Over the past two months Ive received two flight schedule changes which were 5 minutes forwards or backwards Fine no issue there five minutes were not going to kill us
Now three days prior to departure the company has amended our flight operator to a subclass airline
I call them up and having been on hold for 30 minutes the call was cut by the operator Again I call another 30 minute wait and again during the call the call was cut off
The only options they gave me were a full refund or move the flight dates if I wanted to fly with the airline I originally booked with Both unacceptable as flight prices are now ridiculously high due to only a few days left
Very bad customer service and service in general I will never fly or recommend you to anyone
Discount of 1920 was agreed Received letter with lower discounts afterwards Made a couple of calls emails to have this corrected Then a discount of only 6 was applied on the invoice Now finally everything is billed correctly and no further complaints
I have been a customer of BG Homecare for coming up 15 years just cancelled my direct debit as appalled at recent service I phoned to arrange my annual boiler service in November and was told they couldnt do it until 4th February as they had been very busy due to the extremely cold weather Wasnt that cold here in Bristol Ive know much colder winters and always only had to wait a couple of weeks for a service so I complained My complaint hadnt been dealt with by the beginning of February so I complained again and was told they wouldnt be able to service my boiler until 27th March today so because BG hadnt dealt with my original complaint I actually had to wait even longer for the service than if I hadnt complained in the first place
Waited in all morning as service had been booked for today between 800 and 1300 at 1200 I called Customer Service and was told that my call had been issued to an engineer and someone would be with me soon When no Engineer arrived I called the chap who had dealt with my complaint in February and who was the person who arranged the service for today He told me that the call had been cancelled 4 days after he arranged it but noone let me know or him either for that matter He said he couldnt understand why Customer Service had told me that it had been issued to an Engineer today he thought the Customer Service Agent must have been lying in case I gave him a hard time
I have cancelled my direct debit and as I havent had to call BG out during this years contract and they clearly cant uphold their end of the contract to provide an annual service I have requested a full refund of all installments paid for this annual contract period They have refused to refund my installments which total over 300 and suggested a compensation amount of 12000 I have refused this as I feel they have not provided the service they say they can and have therefore broken the contract meaning I should be entitled to a refund of all monies paid not to even mention compensation They didnt seem to bothered about losing me as a customer but they agreed their service had been disgraceful and suggested I take the matter to the Ombudsman which I shall do forthwith

Purchased a product id Gh89t1486481445 in the 7th of February and received a shipping confirmation in the day after No tracking number or further information all the company says is that any delay is not their responsibility imagine if a serious company like Amazon would say something like this to their customers Well havent yet received the product after one week and have no idea where the product is because I dont have the tracking number and GameSeek doesnt reply my emails
Will never purchase anything with them again and wouldnt recommend them to anyone
dont create an account if youre gonna forget to skip the month because they charge you 50 and then you have to spend it on an outfit
This experience took over 6 months to complete The homeowner my 9596 year old uncle and I have had a disappointing experience with AAG Amanda Derse was disrespectful I still have one of her downright nasty emails and seemed to drag her feet about completing this loan We were told by Jennifer Feliciano that we could have the repair work done after the loan money came through Jennifer seemed delightful and my uncle was impressed with her Amanda said that the repair work needed to be done up front and my uncle was only given the name of one contractor who charged over 60000 for interior painting a new roof and a small amount of attic insulation I sent a mildly complaining email to Jennifers boss I think his name is Michael OConnor about Amanda He should have responded to me that he would take care of the problem Instead he forwarded the email to Amanda and the issues with her then began The loan was miscalculated and had to be resigned by my uncle a few days after the original signing in Feb i realize that dealing with my uncles caregiver can be difficult but I can handle him and could be brought into any problems right away I will never recommend AAG to anyone and when I see Tom Seleck on television I immediately mute and look away
What I ordered is not whtat I received and the offer made on site for the free transportation was not applied
The shampoo which was supposed to resolve dry hair is not effective
I have no faith that companies cannot enter multiple fake reviews and star ratings in order to boost their own rating
We decided to take a last minute holiday to Rome so called Lastminutecom
We agreed a deal and price with them AND THEY TOOK THE MONEY IN PAYMENT
The day before we were due to fly they sent an EMail saying that the holiday was not confirmed and that we would need to pay another 170 to go
This was not acceptable and no amount of arguing changed the situation
I have seen a lot of evidence of this behaviour from this company from other reviewers
DO NOT TRUST THE OFFER THEY GIVE YOU AS THEY WILL CHANGE IT
went threw all of the BS doing my taxes and got to the checkout screen i put in my card info and it said invalid expiration date but after looking at my bank account i was still charged pretty pis sed because i cant log back in and cant file my taxes literally just had over 50 stollen from me Find a diferrent site to file with this one sucks

We rented 2 cars in Nassau for our group of 7 they only had small cars available When I made the reservation I gave them my flight information We arrived at 930 pm to find the counter closed We took a cab to our resort 75 and went back the next morning 75 to find that they did not have our cars They claimed that I reserved the car for noon and at 100 per their terms and conditions they did not have to honor our agreement They offered a refund of 180 on a 900 bill Im having to go thru my credit card company to get my money back Definitely not how you want to start a vacation
Avoid Travelgenio at all cost
They pop up high in search for flight and lie to you about price over 4 pages or confirmation
And second you select payment all of a sudden its additional 3050 euros as you are not paying with MAESTRO card
Who the hell has maestro cards nowadays
I had been talking to a person a eFaucets on and off for about a month about some bathroom fixtures Several times he mentioned how fast everything ships out because it is always in stock
So if finally placed an order with eFaucets on line late at night And then order a couple more items the next morning I call customer service at 9 30 am to see when the order would ship and was told that my order would not ship for 3 to 5 days and would take 4 to 5 days to arrive I told them that was too long and that I was going to find the fixtures locally
I called back at 1115 am and talked to customer service and told them that I needed to cancel both orders I was told OK it was no problem and they would cancel the orders There was no mention that I could not cancel the order nor was I told that the orders had already been sent to shipping and could not be stopped I went and purchased the fixtures locally The customer service person made NO attempt to find out exactly when or where the items were shipping from Something two other customer service people told me he could do
Two days later I get a call from a trucking company tryining to deliver a bath tub and toilet from efaucets I tell them that I had cancelled the order and was not accepting it
I called efaucets explained what had happened and they apologized for the mistake but said they dont accept cancellations of orders Even though what I was told was wrong
They never mentioned that they charge for refused orders or returned orders
A couple of days later I received some more of the fixtures and call customer service again explaining the whole situation and ask if I could cancel whatever hadnt shipped and wanted to return the product that came in The customer service person said they would take care of it and again did not mention anything about a restocking fee She told me that the first person should have told me that everything ships right away and should have told me that it would be three to five days before it shipped She said she was going to get with the supervisor and make sure this is all straightened out because what I was told was wrong
A few days later I receive a piece and I again call customer service They confirmed that it was all set up to return everything In the approximate 5 minutes talked to person about returning the product she never not even hinted that there would be a restocking fee
Tonight if find out that they are charging me a 15 restocking fee and I am paying for the shipping back
Another Important point is that you really I mean really need to make sure you know what you need as they are useless in helping you figure out all the little pieces needed to order
Mid to late Feb had a fabulous experience with iFlyBusiness booking tickets to LHR agent calledfollowed up ended up getting several hundred dollars off of what airline was showing Went back last week for tickets on a different trip Agent found a stunning deal 1600 off what airline was showing I emailed back to hold and obtain the link to confirm and pay Got busy with work and realized next day I had not heard back from agent Forwarded yesterdays email and agent said he never received and deal was gone Best deal he could obtain then day was a paltry 99 less than what airline was offering A month ago as a first time customer I received telephone calls as followup to ensure I had all the info and knew timelines were running out this time totally ignored and it cost me a 3200 additional for two tickets Too bad the same agent Arthur didnt do the same followup as when I was a new customer
Paid more than 130 dollars for a 40 dollar ticket
Seriously
I could not find a way to pay the actual value of the ticket
You should be ashamed of yourselves
You will get charged a restock fee pay for your shipping return and other hidden fees

Ive used foodler quite extensively for a while The points add up and the refunds are nice Unfortunately thats as far as it goes Ive had restaurants take more than 3 hours to get my food to me and foodler just says Were sorry have 5 we cant do anything Most recently I had an order where it was wrong I called the restaurant and they were all bubbly and happy to make things work for me Ten minutes later I get a call asking me to give them my food when they arrive I actually just threw it away When I said I couldnt do this because it was thrown away they slammed down the phone Im now actually concerned about eating this food and foodler just says we cant refund so sorry have 5 in foodler bucks Not in refund foodler bucks Which means that if I want any part of this order I wasted money on to come back to me itll be in foodler bucks and I have to use their platform again Ive had 3 email exchanges with them in 40 minutes Ive also been on hold in the hopes that I can work this out with someone instead of just emailing back and forth Ive now been on hold for 40 minutes and theyre refusing to work with me via email and probably wont actually pick up their phone To add to this since Foodler replied their support team didnt contact me other than to say to bad so sad restaurant wont refund your order I now have to deal with a chargeback where I dispute this charge at the bank level and Foodler is refusing to literally do anything I do not recommend doing this I know there are other alternatives out there and honestly the issue for me is in accessibility as foodler for the most part is accessible for those who are blind and using screen reading software but I hope now more than ever that other companies made their platforms accessible I dont even plan on spending this 5 in foodler bucks Ive never been more irritated and I think its just a bit absurd that Foodler appologises and tells me their support team has been in contact with me to get a good public image No they have not Dont lie on a review site
Holy crap This literally took me FOREVER because the place order button just randomly disappeared and then it kept saying my address wasnt in the United States The zip code section would disappear for the billing address so it wouldnt let me type it in FINALLY I somehow got it to work I dont ever want to shop here again So please fix all this buggy stuff
I received confirmation that I had purchased a coin on Feb 25th On March 1st I received the below email message I am sure it probably says they can renege in the fine print somewhere but I just didnt expect it
Please be aware that the following items have been placed on permanent back order in our vault and are not available You card will not be charged and the order has been cancelled due to the out of stock of the item
My Quote doubled in price this year to over 1200 Im 34 and never claimed in my life Got a cheaper Quote elsewhere Will be unlikely to return
I was registering more than 20 trademarks for 2 companies across 10 countries Most of them turned out fine but for the New Zealand TM they registered it under the wrong name and address They told me it would get fixed shortlyIts been almost a year and now when i ask when its going to get fixed I dont hear back from them No reply no follow upnothingConsidering Ive spent more than 20K in registration costs this is pretty unacceptable And to ignore their own customer when it was 100 their fault Take your money elsewhere as there are plenty of other options out there for a cheaper price and will at the least follow up with you when it was their mistake
Harvey Norman mixed up two orders and I received wrong item which I returned upon receipt of return label I expected immediate delivery of my order but was inconvenienced by Harvey Norman waiting for items to be returned before completing my order The customer service person said it was their policy  even if it was their fault BAD POLICY
DONT USE THIS SHIPPING SERVICE FOR ANYTHING
We had a horrendous experience with CitizenShippercom  AlphaOmega getting our 11yrold precious pet transported from CA to OK They lead us to believe it would be a 12 night trip but her ordeal took her through Utah Colorado  Kansas taking 7 days while we were strung along by Erica with promised ETAs within 24 hours We went from okay to panicked to terrified for our pet and then felt like paymentscheme victims as they got our credit card info asked for cashiers checks Moneygram payments to 3rd parties and finally made us set up and pay with a Venmo account with no recourse Then Ericas time frames for our dogs delivery got vaguer and vaguer We agonized through the whole ordeal worried sick about our pet She finally arrived pee soaked and out of food We will never use this service again and are reporting CitizenShippercom and AlphaOmega to the Better Business Bureau and the Department of Transportation
search for a ticket via momondo which redirected to flightnetworkcom
Same price as on momondo was reconfirmed on the flightnetwork website and bought the ticket on flightnetwork 20minutes later after charging my card for the ticket price of 1700 I got an email saying the flight is not confirmed
I had to call flightnetwork and waste more than an hour to figure out what happened The representative said that this was a mistake by momondo However this is not true as the flight was booked through the flightnetwork website He reassured me that I would need to pay another 400 to book that flight as this was the best available THis is very unprofessional and left me 1700 short for a week which is the snail pace that it took them to refund my money
Never again
Tried to rent a storage unit Went to location and followed directions Directions indicated check out at kiosk 2 Went into rental station and only Kiosk 1 was physically there No 2 anywhere Called help number and it is managed by a company in Colorado who have never visited the properties Absolutely no help resolving my problem
Never closed the rental agreement and actually rented a unit down the street from a company that actually had people of site
This company is not cheap enough nor are the locations that convenient to put up with service like this
Go elsewhere if possible
I booked in with soneone from homestay and tried to message them twice No reply and now I wont know how to get to their place when I do go to San Diego
Returns not recommended especially for international customers
The business cards Ive received went straight into a rubbish bin The colours were distorted they were bent at he edges the print quality was poor and there was a black line at the edge of each card which definitely was not in the design The customer service was fine they offered a reprint but only on the same quality paper so I wasnt able to change or upgrade it I refused the reprint as I didnt want more rubbish in my bin
Took longer than expected to receive delivery
I was caught off guard after booking my unit online I was given a price which jumped an additional 10 or maybe a bit more than that for insurance which was deemed a requirement when I visited the storage facility in person I wish they had shared this information upfront with me Secondly was disappointed in the narrow entryways and hallways for my second floor unit It was not easy to navigate down the hallway and I wish these had been expanded for larger items being placed in storage
This company NEVER sent my orders I made the mistake of ordering from them 2 times NEVER got either order Now they are telling me that I cant get a refund because I didnt pay for insurance They said it is the shipping companys fault BOTH TIMES REALLY Bad company 1
Booked a flight with them and had to change flight dates They never answer calls They always put me on hold and cut the call
USELESS CUSTOMER SERVICE I will advise you to not waste your time on this website Go directly to the airline company
I have already changed my flight from airline paying extra cost Thanks for noticing There is no need to do any changes for me anymore travelgenio
Thanks
We booked this on the 19th of February it got collected on the 21st of February then just hung around in Victoria a week then went to WA and stayed there 10 days in Perth before being delivered Crap service poor tracking and really poor communication
When Boronia were contacted things started to happen but the processes that are in place are weak from order to delivery 25 days Quote d 9 to 11
I have ordered goods and services from many sites but oldies has been a one and done for me After paying up front it took 13 days to receive ONE cd A dog sled would have been quicker I left two different replies with Oldies but never received an answer
the picture makes some of your glasses look sturdy and they are not
I have been waiting for my order for over a week No way to track it or to contact customer service I need this by end of week for work If i would have known there was no customer service or way to track the order i wouldnt have used this site
I gave this company a try after I heard their commercial many times  I made it perfectly clear with the consultant she what I was looking for to refinance with the company and she assured me she could make it happen As the process progressed I had to keep repeating myself or reminding her what we discussed as I was then often given different information I feel that the she was agreeable just to get my business She changed the info she gave me multiple times sometimes stating that the reason was because it was a federal law In the end I agreed to the terms but WILL NEVER DEAL WITH THEM AGAIN
I made a purchase of 3 items due to quality and price It saddens me to rate this low When trying to voice my concern about the delivery I had to make 5 calls on my own with no response from a manager after several requests I even asked corporate for a call and have received nothing
It just takes one empathic call taking ownership of the poor experience The experience trickles down from leadership Thebasics
Im pretty sure I clicked the no insurance button but still ended up with an insurance policy that I didnt want AAARRRGHH And how does one go about reversing these things Its not like its easy to call these folks from overseas The insurance inclusion should be the automatic choice not the default
UPS used to be reliable as Swiss clockwork You would book a pickup a friendly helpful driver would arrive and your package would arrive at its destination when UPS said it would
However recently they have gone down the pan Here are two examples of their socalled premium express option I have experienced recently
1 Australian saga
I ship a package to Australia The package gets from Europe to Australia in 2 days  so far so good
Then it gets stuck in Botany for 3 DAYS UPS said mechanical breakdown
Now for you who dont know Australia Botany a suburb next to Sydney Airport and my package was destined for Sydney 18 minutes drive away
HOW ON EARTH CAN IT TAKE 3 DAYS FOR A PACKAGE TO TRAVEL 18 MINUTES 
2 TransEurope saga
Ok now I send a premium UPS Envelope by their premium UPS Express pre 1030 to another European country
I receive a notification that there has been a transportation accident Fine ok accidents happen But that was at 1am and at the time of posting this post it is now 6pm and the UPS tracking is still saying transportation accident  Seriously 
I will change my review once payment is received 
Your sales staff and employees are wonderful  very nice people and I dont want to complain but this was one of the most problematic large purchases I have ever made I could write a book but I will attempt to sum it up
Came in with a tape measure because the space we needed furniture was tough to get to We were told size didnt matter because you had a service where the furniture could be disassembled  the sales associate raved about the service and said it would be done at delivery We picked a living room set  knowing it was too big and needed disassembly 5300 worth of furniture Delivery came  couldnt get the coach in the basement said they didnt disassemble it was a different department and there was a charge
Made arrangements for the disassemble  got a call several days later saying they couldnt do it Over 2 weeks went back and forth about what to do with the set Finally made a decision  the order had to be changed so many times we were locked out of financing Had to go over to the store and handle that All I got off was 50 for all of the trouble  hours on the phone  and finally the furniture being delivered over 2 weeks later
I thought I would at least get the furniture insurance on the house for all of the trouble I did deal with an assistant manager once the problems came up Very frustrating  always went to Art Van First purchase through GardnerWhite
Only suggestion I can make is training the sale people better  they need to tell the customer from the beginning there is a cost to disassembly and know which furniture can or cant be disassembled
Reduce shipping prices
I booked a flight on an airline with paid baggage Spirit and you folks did not inform me of that while booking Five minutes after booking I called you and was told that carry on bags were 45 booked through you at that time and not the 35 had I booked on Spirit

I ordered the Harley Softail Deluxe Viking Odin Large Motorcycle Saddlebags After installation I discovered the universal mounting bracket was interfering with the belt guard I proceed to use the largest spacer and it still did not provide sufficient clearance This is a obvious design flaw I emailed Viking and they told me they will send me a new and improved bracket and it should solved the problem The new and improved bracket did not solved the problem It made it even worst I email them again with photos and video explaining the problem and wanted to return the bags for a refund The following is the reply from them
Hello As mentioned in the previous email we do recommend you redrill the bags into a position where the bags do not come into contact with any part of youre motorcycle Once you have redrilled the bags we can provide plugs for the extra set of holes needing to be drilled A careful dry mount is instructed in all of our instructions which is shown in the attached image That being said we do not accept return on drilled bags per our return policy Should you have any further questions feel free to reply to this emailHave a great day Viking Bags Management

Inadequate support from facebook no remedy re coned account Changing password for this issue is no good as the clone page also receives this information

After 4 months of using this product something broke in the wiring and the vibrations stopped working Can still use without but for the price it makes it a very expensive dildo
Disappointed that could not use my business club membership and no one to date has contacted me to update They cancelled my membership with out any notification Once again disappointing
My item was never shipped and the phone numbers were not valid One was to Labor and Delivery at a local hospital and the other was to a woman that claimed to have never heard of Chicago Airbrush I believe this business has or is failing I would not buy from them I have purchased from them in the past and had no problems This time I thought it was odd that I never received a confirmation email after I had placed my order but the money was taken out of my account BEWARE
put stuff in cart then go to checkout and everything or selected color is unavailable If this is so it should be listed as such so one does not select those options for purchase In this day and age there is NO excuse to not have a one click paypal option NONE Inexcusable Get with the program
yesterday i bought mins to call i tried 100 time to call to 3 defferent no but there is only beil is ringing otherside i emailed to help but they did solve my problum i have very bad experience about this company
thanks
I would like a full refund of my product as I was in pleased with my purchase
Having searched for cheap flights and finding a great deal  I continued to place my card details and book the flight selecting the purchase button It was at this point that I realized I had been entirely wrong to assume that the price i had found and agreed to pay would be the actual price taken from my account
One prompt confirmation email later and I realise my great flight prices were coupled with an extortionate and unethical 32 euro charge NOT WHAT I AGREED
Even worse when I called customer service I was connected to lastminute CS who blamed another website entirely  cancelled my flight and were unable to refund my money for a further 2 weeks by which point flight prices have inevitably increased by more than 30 euros An appalling experience  DO NOT USE
It should be up to the customer how they will use the credit that has already been charged to their account Why are there terms and conditions for using our credits If I wanted to purchase items on the clearance section why cant I It is completely possible that more money will be spent on purchasing extra items than just purchasing solely to complete the credit I planned to use my credit as well as purchase more items on the site because I found MANY pieces that I would love to own I am really disappointed that I have terms and conditions to follow Honestly I am more than likely to cancel my membership now and tell others to not ever consider this brandsite
Place an order back on December 8th for 2 items It is now March 12 and still havent received anything Tried reaching someone for answers but got nowhere Until tonight the support team said that their may be some holidays and bad weather that delayed the process Um you charged by card the same day i made the purchases And i dont believe it would take 90 days to get my items The excuses dont make any sense Will never order there again I hope other customers will steer clear of this horrible company
The support team just finally got back to me and told me that they are not responsible fort he shipping aspects of the company if it was never shipped They are no responsible for lost packages made by the parcel companies And since i didnt purchase their insurance their is not much they can do No refund or reshipping of the items
Nothing to say it will be a waste of time
Does not generate a certificate All common sense so its a waste of time
I bought a ticket to Lagos on Arik Air the staff would not help me process my refund The female staff I spoke witb initially was and even denied responsibility of refund She would not even give me the airline contact details to call them
I am very disappointed as a customer who buys my ticket from you all the time I travel I still want my refund please I dont even know why I paid for another ticket via your agency
Please refund my initial ticket with Arikair
I ordered a dress for the wife after 3 weeks I sent them a email asking how long for shipping It took 9 days for dresslily to answer the email The answer was 5 to 25 days From the day I ordered to the day I received it took 58 days SL W
Im very impressed with your prices and your range however I didnt recieve a confirmation email or any kind of tracking info I emailed to find out what happened and recieved no resonse since it was a 1000 purchase that made me very nervous I was worried that Id typed my email wrong but since Ive just received this email asking me about my experience Im guessing thats not the case
When buying almost 500 worth of goods they shipped some by courier and the rest by mail so most of the product got to me in two months When it arrivedmanuals were either in Chinese or broken English with no info When I contacted the company for tech support no reply no answer to tech issues So out of 500 I managed to have 200 worth of product working the rest is useless You decide
Customer service takes too long to reply no communication between CS staff
Absolute terrible  Horrible customer service to add to it Worst company Ive ever dealt with and Id tell everyone to stay away Taking money and ordered flowers for Mothers Day paid for them and all 2 hours later received a email stating wont be delivered and will get refunded in 25 work days Ive since sent a further email to check updates and only to be told over 10 days Ill have to wait now Horrible way to do business and treat customers
fast 100 good
mistake 1 is ok but 3 too much
The reason for so many good reviews on here is because the trust pilot form pops up right after the tickets have first been purchased Everything is fine at this point
However 10 days later they called to say the tickets are being refunded due to some flight cancellation seems unlikely to me and they cant give me alternatives because the price has shot up 10 days nearer the time so not surprising really
Lots of bad reviews on other websites with them doing similar things They have said they will refund but its now leaving me having to reschedule the holiday for a much higher price
My flights were Taipei to Tokyo then to Shanghai for 1 night then to Taipei
Update they did give me a full refund so remarked as a 2 however they werent interested in trying to honour the existing holiday I booked with them nor helping me fine a replacement
Did get my shirt but it was the wrong size I send it back and never got the money back
Im unsure if I read the item incorrectly or what exactly caused the issue but I was expecting an insufflator bulb for an otoscope and received a bulb to pump up blood pressure cuffs Im fairly certain the wording implied I was purchasing the right item and the image appeared to be what I was expecting however what came in the mail was something else
As other reviewers have noted sadly the Alamo office at the Catania airport lends its otherwise reputable name to the awful local car rental company Locauto I made a prepaid reservation with Alamo at this location in February 2017 and arrived to learn that my reservation would be handled by Locauto which online reviews confirm to be one of the worst rental companies I did not receive the make or size of the car that I had booked they gave me a much larger car that was unwieldy in the medieval villages that we were visiting Worse upon my return Locauto demanded 496 Euro for two small preexisting scratches on the car Incredible Of course I refused to pay these made up charges Do not rent from Locauto or the Catania airport Alamo We have had great experiences with Auto Europe in Sicily and the rest of Italy which I will stick to from now on
Well when I called rental 8 the price on computer was 1846 a day not even 10 min later I went to book car and it went up to 2046 a day was not very happy it is like the price was increased after I contacted the service
First I order a phone that I want and paid After take my money they told me that they dont have it and they can give me another one with a gold color For dont lose money of the transference I accept that After 3 months the phone didnt arrive They just told me that they will send me back the money and of course without commission of my bank I LOSED TIME AND MONEY WITH BANGGOOD I cant recommend at all
I bought a pair of beautiful expensive Celine sunglasses When I received themIN A BOX THAT HAD BEEN RIPPED OPEN they were defective so I emailed costumer service and explained the situation They said they could send me new lenses that I could replace So I said ok please send me new lenses After a few days I get a response saying they dont have new lenses at that moment but if I could wait 3 months they would have them This sounded strange and not really nice but I said fine as long as they would ship them to me as soon as possible Time goes by and I get a reply saying that they will never get new lenses What But then they go on saying I can return the glasses IF I HAVE THE ORIGINAL BUBBLE WRAP AND BOX THEY WERE SENDT TO ME IN WHICH BY THE WAY WAS DESTROYED BY SOMEONE DURING SHIPPING SO OF COURSE I THREW IT OUT This is unacceptable and do not recommend this store Like if you buy sunglasses for several hundred dollars pluss import tax YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS KIND OF UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR AND THEY SHOULD EXAMINE THE PRODUCT FOR DEFECTS BEFORE SHIPPING IN THE FIRST PLACE
Drone world is the absolute worse
No communication tried several times to contact by phone with no luck
Finally I had to call my credit card company to ask for a refund
After 3 months they could not send my items and no contact whatsoever
Do no recommend drone world
Will never order anything from these people
I bought a ticket through Bravofly for my partner to travel from Manchester to Melbourne I bought the ticket on the basis of a price that was clearly specified on the screen when I pressed payment  in Australian dollars This was also the price on the confirmation email that i received
A few days later when I checked my credit card details the amount they debited was almost one hundred dollars more I have written and called them and they do not even seem to comprehend my complaint because their responses are totally off topic
I buy flight tickets online all the time and this is the first company that has advertised one price and debited a higher amount It seems they are not able to calculate exchange rates
Do not ever buy tickets through them as they have completely dishonest business practices and I will be definitely contacting the relevant authorities to inform them of this They should not be allowed to run a business
One guy tried to sell me rims he liked Didnt provide tracking numbr when order was complete I called to get one and they gave me a run around They sent the wrong lug nuts and wouldnt send correct ones unless I bought new ones then sent incorrect ones back and waited for a refund Difficult to deal with and would not recommend to others The only positive my rims came in in 4 days
Was supposed to arrive 35 days after purchase Two weeks later and after multiple phone calls finally ready to dispatch
Next day got an email saying I was to be refunded and that they were out of stock But they were packed the previous day BS
Terrible communication long packing time items never shipped or received
Will NEVER use again
i want ask you

I ordered a short pixie cut and received a shaggy bob Dont order from this company Very disappointed
I selected a flight from flygresorse that I was fine with After transfered to Supersaverse I am presented with a lot of options that makes it very hard to once again select the one I already had chosen When I finally find it it is more expensive than what I had been presented earlier Trying to finish the booking anyway I dont want to search again I am given a lot of options I have to deselect and it is even hard to deselect them When I believe I have chosen just the travel the price is higher once again and I have to go back and deselect something I thought I had selected This can only have one reason and that is to make me buy something I dont want It is misleading and confusing I will try hard to find other ways of buying my trips in the future and even pay more to do so I still give you a 2 and that is because I expect to get the trip I have purchased which I havent seen yet

Stupidly I ordered my little boy some football tickets without checking the reviews
My payment has gone though they have taken my money but our now asking for a picture of my credit card And passport
No documents given Partly refund only after 25 days  customers are financing the co Car not cleaned
I have had the misfortune of booking with travelginotravel2be I was promised a refund in December for a flight where the airline refused the passenger Both the airline and Travelgino confirmed I would receive the refund however since then theyve said this is not possible and that the airline is refusing it Ive called the airline several times and theyve told me this is simply not true and that travelgino is the one not processing the refund When Ive asked for proof of refusal from the airline theyve been unable to provide it
I will never book with this agency again nor will I recommend it to others I have been incredibly disappointed with what I believe is deceitful behavior of the business and a disregard for customer service and honesty
I contacted them Now I have to send pictures of the original key Should have done this locally
Looking for specific flight time and date put ut in the calendarwhen searching the system flipped to the next day for the return
Ididnt notice
When called to cancel you would cancel but have to wait up until 10 days for refund Disappointing as u dont wait 10 days to charge me
Trying to return my item and not sure clear how to go about it
Recharge unsuccessful but they charged my bank account
I have been a loyal customer of DTV for over 20 years back when they were Primestar as always all other cable companies try to match or upgrade to move to their service I did not go anywhere I was so pleased and when my health took a turn for the worse and I had financial issues that prevented me from keeping the service they charged me over 20000 cancellation fee where is the compassion and ability to work with someone had to cancel in order to put food on the table I am so upset and again cancellation was due to health not just because I didnt want it please be careful and dont upgrade any boxes if you dont have to now they say no one can do anything and I have to write a letter to the main office by the time someone reads my concern I could be dead

Bad tissue and the stones on bodice are plastic many were detached and I had to sew 200 down the drain not worth the price
Some cheap products with the only option of urgent courier raises the price above the local stores
And customer service has lost effectiveness
consistently Quote d me incorrectly Terrible customer service
I read so many reviews before deciding to go with doctorSIM to unlock my phone as I wasnt sure who to and not to trust and it was my first time unlocking a phone I was gladly surprised by the price and online reviews that I went along with it thinking this would be a great experience I was highly mistaken At first everything went smoothly and I received an email stating my iPhone 6 Plus was unlocked from the current carrier I was using and only a few days after the purchase I couldnt have been more pleased I took my phone into the new carrier I wanted to go with and set up my phone and all was great up until I tried using the SIM card I was given it contiusoulsy said that the SIM card isnt valid with the carrier I email them after trying everything I could possible over two days and all they could say is they will try again because it didnt work the first time  and so they did I waited two weeks without a word of how my phone was doing and then emailed them wanting an update on my phone and again they said they were trying I was extremely frustrated so I emailed them back asking for a refund multiple times as they say on their website they will if they cannot unlock the phone  which they hadnt They emailed me back saying again that they are trying to fix it even though I didnt ask them to because I just wanted my money back for the three weeks wasted I emailed them again today and no response from them even though they have a 247 online service and have responded to my first few emails within 15 mins of sending them  was the best thing about them but not anymore I am completely disappointed in service  left frustrated and confused with no answers I feel they are taking my money and ignoring me so they dont have to refund me This was a waste of 42 Worst experience Ive ever had dont use doctorSIM
Hired a car for the week cheap and was happy enough As it was for business needed a VAT receipt Asked via their website and returned a day later to see they had closed it without sending said invoice or even acknowledging my request
SO I am now out of pocket as my company wont refund without an invoice Would I use this lot again Nope sorry Any company who does this isnt worth the time
I had heard great things about intrepid but ended up being very disappointed in my tour From the moment I arrived in Cuba things were disappointing I waited a long time at the airport before someone eventually picked me up and then was dropped off at an room a long way from the old town I was charged an extra 100 a night for my very basic room which was nearly a one hour walk from the old town so ended up having to pay more money for taxis There were similar guest houses right in the city centre for only 30 so I know intrepid was hugely overcharging me Once the tour started our tour guide was quite aloof and seemed to resent any questions which were asked if him He was grumpy and at times downright rude and did not seem to enjoy his job The bus wheels squeaked for the whole 9 days which was both annoying and dangerous For the money the tour cost the whole experience was overpriced and disappointing I will not use intrepid again
I was purchasing facial steamer and the picture of the product wasnt the same as the product they send me When i spoke with someone from AMR they just said that this is new model and that was it Even though i told them i am after the old model she said they dont have it No sorry no apology for the wrong photo no refund offered no other solution offered It was disapointing
My girlfriend bought a ticket to fly to the UK using Bravofly through skyscanner Not only did they not send a confirmation email immediately after the flight was booked when she checked the flight a week before there was no record of a scheduled flight at all She tried to call them to find out what was going on and of course there was no reply She then had to buy another ticket last minute This company is a JOKE  they will take your hardearned money and not respond to anything once you chase them Should be shut down
I ordered Order  1511921 a cake from Flora2000 in Feb and it was delivered a day later in the evening So much for their tag line Nothings worse than a gift arriving late On Time Assured  First I reported when it did not get delivered on the date Next I reported when I found out that the cake was hard and stale The recipient was embarrassed to even let me know in case they would hurt my feelings It was a let down for me
They responded back asking me for pictures of the cake to prove that it was hard and stale Like the recipient would preserve a stale cake for a week and the pictures will scream out to indicate that the cake is stale I have used flora for a long time and never had an issue I would have let this pass had they not responded silly and also kept my money
NeverAgainFlora
Do not get involved with opt in bonuses they wont honour them and customer service is a joke so dont trust these shisters Rubbish site
Ordered flowers to be delivered 4 days ago Still waiting Contacted customer services to be told sometimes delays happen These were for a birthday which was 4 days ago so not much use now So much for 100 satisfaction guarantee Would not recommend anyone to use this company
I was given the wrong Quote twice then the service lady had the guys to turn around and say it was my fault anyway Very rude Will not be using this company again
I went into the store on 15 and Rochester and purchased a very nice bed for a great price Order  062123428 it was a 4 to 5 star experience The 1 star comes from the previous purchase I made for a couch set The electric recliner caught a shortage he used partscords from my sofa to fix the love seat which he described as a temporary fix Its been 3 years neither couch is functional and im still waiting for customer service to contact me back This has gone on far too long and im tired of getting the run around
Had an issue with 2 orders that were in fact ordered at the same time however they were ordered separately for some strange reason one minute apart from one another in addition to having to pay shipping for both items when they were in one order exceeding the amount of 3499
I reached out to customer service immediately and told them about the issue in which they proceeded to say that it was a glitch furthermore the shipping fees were not refunded given the acknowledgment of the glitch
Advertised 2 day shipping did not mention it would take over a month to be ready to ship It took more than 2 days to ship on top of that
The reply to this is everything they have via a computer where people can input incorrect times and dates to cover it up For me to even write a review and reply to one should let you know Im not inaccurate I dont usually care but for it to take over a month to recieve something you order online with 2 day priority shipping it isnt worth the ridiculous price
Dates are incorrect still but thats fine Whatever helps you sleep at night 
I wanted to have a clearout so decided to use Ziffit to get rid of some old CDs
Conscious of their strict reject and non return policy I ensured to fully check each and every one of the 86 CDs I sent It was a very long and laborious job but I wanted to ensure each one worked so as not to get anything rejected
Much to my surprise a few days later I received notification that 9 of the CDs 10 were rejected due to damage
I queried this with the customer services team as know 100 that they were all in full working order a number of them were brand new or hardly played I also packaged up very carefully so there was no possibility of damage during transit
After contacting the customer service team a number of times I have gotten nowhere They cant even be bothered to write a proper response instead using a generic copy and paste replies stating their Tc and Cs
I asked for the CDs to be rechecked but they have been disposed of apparently very convenient
I feel completely cheated and ripped off and having read reviews on other sites it appears this happens to a lot of people
I would not recommend ziffit
I recently purchased a pair of the come des garons Nike dunks in a size 10 However when they arrived to my surprise they were a size 8 When I called customer care they said they could do nothing about it except grant me free shipping to return the item I have been a sense customer for a few years now and this by far as been the worse customer experience Ive had
I booked a flight through their pet scam  bravofly AirAsia canceled the route A MONTH AGO and returned the money to bravoflys account A MONTH AGO according to air asia Here I am stuck in Mauritius without enough money to get back to the US and go back to work Everytime I call Im promised theyll work on it but theres no indication they received the refund contrary to Air Asias statement This is by far the worst company Ive dealt with and theyve made my life a living hell As a contractor for the department of commerce I feel its time to get the FTC and Better Business Bureau involved

I ordered a truck rear axle shaft which was poorly packaged When it arrived on my doorstep the package was torn open on one end and part of the bare axle was laying on the concrete There was minimal damage in multiple spots around the lug plate of the axle It doesnt appear that it will affect the products operation but I wont know until its installed And there was either no packing slip shipped with it or it fell out somewhere during transport I would think with something that heavy that it would be packaged with more protection than just a smallthin piece of cardboard Very unhappy Everyone knows that shipping companies such as the one used here UPS are hard on packages so its important that theyre packaged accordingly
We booked a car from Ace Car Rental Sydney through Rentalcarscom We got downgraded car booked Mitsubishi Outlander got Mitsu ASX They had 4 Outlanders inside but told me all were due maintenance The real reason probably was they wanted us to return their QLS plated ASX to Brisbane where we were driving We were still charged extra oneway fee of 300 AUD for returning their car and no compensation for downgrade
I was confident Rentalcarscom would surely compensate something but they just told us that Ace Car is saying ASX is same class car as Outlander OK so it must be if they say so even though Outlander is bigger and 4WD which the ASX is not Rentalcarscom compensated nothing and took no responsibility even though my contract was actually with them So why not book directly from car rental companies as these guys will not help you with anything of you have problems Appalling
Dishonest changed product listing and availability date lied about shipping very bad customer support will never do business again
Whilst there wasnt a problem with the rentalcarscom website the problem arose when picking up the vehicle from 1stFirst car hire Who wanted a far greater deposit than was documented on our confirmation They also tried very hard to sell additional insurance when we had already purchased full cover from Rentalcarscom Their fee for renting a satnav was the same as purchasing one we decided to use a map Not that they gave us one The whole process too almost an hour after waiting the the que for our turn Eventually we got things sorted and were shown to the car
I rented my Goldcar hire car for two weeks The car was ok my only criticism was the seats were a bit dirty but no problem
When I retuned the car they said I had made the seats dirty and the cleaning bill was 15035 euros which is taken from my credit card no proper VAT invoice provided either I have additional excess insurance but that doesnt cove cleaning
It is a scam
They take photos of the dirty seat and send it to you with a copy of the invoice but when I complained and asked for the photo of the seats before I hired the car they say thats not possible
Just as a note I was travelling alone but Goldcar say I managed to get both front seats dirty
Amazing scam I bet the next person who hires this car has the same scam done to them then the next and the next
This was my first business trip to Tenerife but Ill need to hire a car four times a year every year up to 2022 Guess who I wont be using
Avoid this company at all costs
In response to the reply below if you can send me a photo of the dirty seats after I hired the car then you also have photos of the seats from after the previous customer Take a look at them and send me a copy They will prove the seats were dirty before I collected it Ive already asked you to do this but it isnt your policy No your policy is to rip people off
I ll never ever recommend anyone to hire a car from redspot hobart airport Just hired a car for 3 days and they told us they gonna hold 200  and send us back if all toll and fines are fine So we were happy with out trip and was flyin back to sydneylater when we took the car back to them they checked the car and showed us the small tiny dent which can be hardly seen and told us to pay 4400 we were totally shocked and never expect that we will be forced to pay so much and when we asked how we can claim it back they had no idea they just know how to get the money dats itwe were forced to pay 4400 and thats huge some of money  I tried to call and they always say that their claim department id looking after it but for how long are they gonna look at it just for a tiny dent Regarding this case gotta watch few days otherwise need to talk with solicitar regarding that matteri was using E47VC no plate car just for 2 and half day and they charged me such a big amount would never recommend anyone ripp off total
There is no customer service at all Ive been trying to get a hold of them for two days no response they dont pick up the phone no response to live chat or emails avoid this company

Based on all the glorified stories of so called Experts I decided to do a test purchase on Alibaba with hope of selling via Amazon FBA I followed all the advice  narrowed down on a supplier who was Gold supplier with Trade assurance  Onsite checked The supplier was in 7th year of business as per Alibaba Till the time of purchase the supplier agent replied to every query
As soon as I made the purchase the supplier vanished with no response to messages After a lot of effort the agent did finally respond but demanded additional fee for shipping not disclosed at time of purchase which was way more than the original fee and would leave no room for profit When I asked the reason for this additional fee the supplier conveniently gave an excuse that it was a mistake and original fee was misQuote d
Now im trying to get my money back but am not too hopeful Fortunately I invested only 50 to test the waters I was skeptical from the start but still wanted to give it a shot just to get a first hand experience
Warning to others Dont get fooled by the hyped reviews  success stories by internet marketers They are either promoting an ebook video plugin related to Alibaba which they want you to purchase Thats how they have become successful by conning people
Even if you do manage to get the shipment somehow the profit you will make will be in single digits or you may even go in loss if you invest in advertising
Its either 5 or 6 times in a row that myself or ex or daughter have bought something and there is always something wrong It is almost as if they expect it because the drivers are so quick to suggest delivering another one or return and get your money back I know thats what they are supposed to do but after awhile it just loses its appeal I can basically have it delivered one day a week because of my work schedule so if its not right then it becomes a major inconvenience With the just purchased 2k washer  dryer I caught the problems after they hooked things up so was wo for a week until they delivered new ones Just bought a bedroom dresser and did not slide every drawer in and out and you guessed itone drawer doesnt stay on the slideI guess that wouldnt have been important to check before it was put on the truckyes Ill just fix it myself
I entered a contract for services in January and since initial installation four appts were scheduled to install additional cameras After setting my day aside for 9am to 1pm appt blocks no technician showed up showed up later than the appt block or showed up and left saying he couldnt do the job Its mid March and the equipment still hasnt been installed I have asked several times to be released from my contract so that I could separate myself from this company and use a new company who could actually install the desired equipment and serve my familys needs but Alliance refuses to do so demanding a 700 payment of contact balance to do so They do not care about their customers lock you in a contract and wont let you out even though they give you horrible service AND rude customer service This is a nightmare Alliance operates like scammer loan sharks
Every time I try to check out after deleting probiotics from my order Im still getting a 2499 charge for shipping When I go start to ship again and when I check out without probiotics Im still being charged 2499 shipping charge Someone needs to fix this This is the worse experience I have had in years

Ive noticed that Apricot power only sends discounts or coupons after purchase

Not socks use NZ Post  NZ Post said that they attempted to deliver on 26 Jan but it was a business address that was closed No attempt was made to phone leave a card or email
Then when it wasnt delivered by the due date 27 Jan I phoned JS and advised that the place was a residential and there was someone at home the entire time a delivery still did not occur until 8 Feband then it was put in the mail boxwithout any effort made to knock on the dooragain someone was home In the interim JS had said oh dear we tried to follow up and if you were in Chch we would hand deliverbut didnt feel as if they were really interested So perhaps they could do the job in Chch but I wouldnt rely on them for Auckland deliveries When they missed the deadline I wanted to cancel the delivery but they ignored and never followed up to see if it was delivered at all
I ordered the glasses specifically for the cable temples The website stated they were for men The temples didnt even reach my ears They are a full inch shorter than my present pair Customer service was not any help Very disappointed
September 2016 I contacted Hangzhou Hisir Network  Technology Co Ltd where I met Rita She was very friendly responded quickly and was sure to answer any questions Long and short I am a retailer and was sourcing some stock for my startup and they had some rather hip designs advertised on their site I order several pieces to sample the garments which arrived timely The first alarm that went off was for the number of pieces I ordered they did not come in a box but in a large plastic envelope The designs looked nothing like the photos and worse the fabric that was meant to be a 60 cotton 40 polyester blend was the cheapest fabric I had ever seen I could see right through the garments and they were so light it was frightening If heat went anywhere near the fabric it singedshrunk like foam I ordered several samples of hoodies and joggers and for them to fit in the envelope in which they arrived was indicative of the synthetic fabric the company was passing off as a Polycotton blend When I contacted Ritar to let her know that I received the items and of my disappointment she told I should have ordered 100 cotton Now I do know that some big box establishment sell joggers with less that 60 cotton and their quality was superior to what I got so I am very sure they lied about the blend She then had the gall to ask me if I wanted to go ahead with the big order vs how would you like your refund I was never refunded Please buyers beware of this company with their Low MOQ and SHODDY GARMENTS HORRIBLE and WASTE OF MONEY

Ordered flowers for Mothers Day for delivery to France
1 web site stated delivered when I checked not delivered
2 then asked to ask my mother to either drive 1 hour to pick them up or rearrange a delivery
3 no refund as they can not be delivered now 5 days old and dead
I supplied them with address which they say cant be found on Google I tried this myself and it found the address they were also were supplied a phone number of my mother to call if they had a problem
I am totally disgusted by there response and there complete lack of customer service
Pay the extra for intaflora far better service all round
All would be fine except how u have to use the other receiver to record if u want to watch a different channel thats the whole point for me each receiver should record and allow us to watch another channelit doesnt BIG SCREW UP Because of that u get one star
Dissatisfaction with Yowza
1 One of the reasons I purchased a Yowza was the 5 yr warranty Unfortunately a warranty is only good as the company offering it Yowza has been terrible in my warranty claim handling thus far
2 The plastic housing was very difficult to align when assembling the machine Even the preassembled housing is not aligned correctly out of the box
3 The machine made unusual noises from the onset
4 The motor apparently has failed
5 Customer service is awful Having to send numerous emails that have NEVER been replied to a single time Calls are not returned When you finally get somebody on the phone Ashley Hall he tries to rush you off the call You have to go out of your way to keep trying to call them to get somebody in person I guess they hope the customer will eventually get frustrated and give up
6 Warranty parts are not shipped expedited Took nearly a week to get a stocked replacement console despite already experiencing a 3week delay IMO it was merely a delay tactic by Ashley Hall This did not fix the problem
7 Heart rate monitor is a joke One of the major reasons I purchased the machine was the claim that it has heart rate control While it does technically have it the heart rate is highly inaccurate which makes this feature useless
8 The ergonomic motion of the machine is poor It is not a smooth consistent motion Rather the machine when it was working has more resistance at certain points in the motion than others So it feels like a buildup and release buildup release etc This is not just due to the failed motor as the machine still has this awkward motion now with no resistance
9 Yowza apparently doesnt stock common replacement parts such as new motors Despite a new motor allegedly being ordered a month ago Ive received no indication when the motor will arrive No tracking number Only excuses from Ashley on the one phone call I managed to have with him One of his excuses was John Simone the original service person was on leave and thats why nobody returned my call Inexcusable If a service person is out a reputable company would engage a substitute service person
This elliptical was the most expensive purchase I made in 2016 as a gift for my wife She used the machine hardly 2 months before the motor failed Now the machine sits there useless At this point with all the issues Ive experienced Im requesting Yowza refund my money I am very disappointed with the Yowza machine and the Yowza company Hoping posting this review will help Yowza to respond Since they dont respond to emails or return phone calls
Your web site is very counter intuitive and slow working found it much more difficult to move around in it and login data than other sites
They advertise free shipping on orders over 50 Then when you spend over 50 and expect to get free shipping you dont if youve used another coupon code If you research their site it says you can only use one coupon code per order A discount on clothes and shipping costs are 2 different things Why would you even advertise free shipping on orders over 50 if you know people cannot redeem it Its very misleading and caused them to lose a customer Every site offers free shipping on orders over a certain amount Seems pretty basic and if they cant offer that then dont advertise it
Try to get my sons airport tax back but as I went with edream travel agency they refuse to give the refund Ive tried to liaise between them but no use Both accuse of each other Lufthansa say they called me to settle this matter but I had never received that call I am so angry Dont use this company
I placed an order order 100107067 on 25th January for 2 cutting blades for a printer an 80 order I contacted Digiprint via webchat a month later 24th February to find out where the order was as Id had no further contact other than order confirmation at the time of placing I was only then informed that the parts were not in stock and they would not be in receipt of them until 1st March By then we needed the parts urgently so I requested to cancel the order immediately as I would source the parts elsewhere I expressed my disappointment that they had not informed me that they did not have the stock and had not notified me poor customer service from the outset I was told via webchat that I could not cancel the order that way but had to send an email directly to digiprint to cancel the order So I wrote up an explanatory email stating the situation and requested to cancel the order The email did not go through that day or the next so I then resent it through the contact us box where eventually I received a reply
 Hi
Thanks for the email
You did not receive an automatized massage
We have launched a new site and had a few problems Im sorry for the in convince caused
We expect the part on the 1st of March Are you certain
I replied that I had already explained myself and yes I was absolutely certain I wanted to cancel the order
Reply
HI
Thanks for the email
Im sorry for the difficultly you have had with our chat service
The email I sent yesterday was a follow up to the automated email you should have gotten
We apologize for any inconvenience vince this may have caused you
Kind Regards
My further reply was a request that could you please confirm that the order had been cancelled
I received no reply
Yesterday the goods turned up and Ive checked my paypal account and the money has been taken
Ive already replaced the goods do not want this package and request a refund immediately I called yesterday hoping for a resolution followed up with an email and still have not heard back
This needs to be resolved ASAP
Please arrange for the goods to be collected and a refund arranged I cant believe the amount of time Ive lost dealing with this order Ive held back on the one star as noone has been rude but frankly the service Ive received so far has been appalling

Nice people and fast work But the quality of their so called Silver metal trophies were thin and cheaply made tin If they gave better detailed descriptions of them then I certainly wouldnt have bought them Once engraved then there is no return Some of our members joked about using them for target practice
The meals were actually almost inedible With the vast number of companies now offering this kind of service I would not recommend Muscle Meals to anyone sadly
I have shopped with blue tomatoe for years and have experienced prompt delivery from the company that has numerous physical shops and product stock spread out over a number of shop and stores around austria and germany
reasonable delays have to be expected to allow the co collect and arrange orders before dispatching
the reason for 1 star review is with every order I have placed over the last 4 years with bt on there website I have been over charged as the price on the website and the price confirmed on the order dosnt match the amount debited or charged to the customer
often items marked in the sale displaying discounted prices are charged at full price
I have continued to purchase products from the co but expect to check recheck and photo the website first before ordering as delays and issues with this service will endure if uk customer shop and purchase in euros as s seem to often confuse bt accounting and prices charged
I recently spent over 820  900 purchasing over 70 items in there end of season sale many items marked with 80 off some fantastic deals show on there website
often you can purchase some brilliant products in there 3 for 2 deals at 80 off
which means some great savings
but I purchased 30 pairs of jeans paying for only 20 due to there 3 for 2 offer at 80 off which means paying 220 for 30 pairs yet I have been charged full price without the offer applied and had 180000 debitted from my account
im currently attempting to resolve this issue but the banks stopped my card due to suspected fraud activities as the company has dispatched numerous parcels and only charging on despatch which looks like mass fraudulent attempts on my account
I have purchased over 300 products from bt in the past and have never had to return a single item genuinely I have loved and used every item how you may ask I have worked in snowsports retail as a clothing manager for many years and know the brands intimately and as such have tried and previously sold many of the products I have purchased at great discount from bt everything is as described and fitted perfectly but I have the knowledge and the brand experience knowing the quality of the product and the fit of each item well in advance puts me at an advantage when purchasing items I have managed to mass a phenomenal wardrobe and kit collection at ridiculously cheap prices a fraction of the retail price often cheaper than the wholesale price
but but but expect pricing issue and problems with billing check recheck and check again you have been warned you will have some twoing and froing with customer services to ensure you are billed as described on there website
ensure you copy the order to the company via email in euros and ensure that matches the charged billing request your order to be dispatched in one box as this makes billing simple and easier use a credit card as you have purchase protection
but bt are a good company and for a retail company with many shops and stores physical stocking can be purchased in shop so not be available in reality online even though stock is available to be purchased this is to be expected dont be upsett or disappointed if you have some items in orders to be unavailable this is just a fact of retail and stock availability trust me I know
but heed my warnings when you shop with them follow the simple rules above and you will obtain some great kit at ridiculously cheap prices
so to recap
order in euros photo the website prices of the items orderd use a credit card to ensure protection copy the prices of ordered item to them with an email requesting confirmation the items will be charged as advertised keep in contact with company and request all items in one box expect stock delays as they are collected from each shop and check re check and check again both items received have been charged at the prices displayed
How come I didnt get to use my 5 of my fist time I am a first time customer This is my purchase for my daughter who is iron deficient Im not too satisfied
this was the first time i ordered here and got good battries in second time they sent me a very cheapbad battery i dont know why did they do that just waste of time
I tried to purchase a CV boot for one of their axles Was too small to fit around hub end Waste of time and grease
Reply I have the axle apart It is a Sixity Axle The Boot sent to replace the original sixty boot was too small Do you offer a proper size replacement
I ordered weeks ago while it showed it was sent out for some reason fedex lost the package I gave it weeks then contacted them Their customer service is absolutely horrendous unhelpful and apparently have no answer is other than to just wipe their hands and not be helpful The fact that after my package was lost I was then told that it was my responsibility as the consumer after my money was taken that I had to deal with it is beyond me period a company after taking somebodys money should 100 take responsibility and step up If you dont have a problem taking money from people then work on your business consumer relationships or train your staff better You chose to hire inexperienced people and not trained them correctly and that is why you are getting such bad reviews Ive asked for a refund repeatedly Ive asked for the order to be resend out and I have outright been told its my problem and I have to fix it Ive even had to go so far as to contact FedEx and be told not only over the phone or via email that the company has to put the claim in not the buyer I do not understand what is so hard about the situation At this point I am so frustrated all I want is a refund and if I have to go so far as contacting my credit card and putting in a claim I absolutely will you have one chance to remedy this do it or face the consequences is very simple
Terrible experience When booking online for a 900pm rental we were asked when our flight was coming in  830 pm we arrived as expected and waited for a shuttle Finally when no shuttle from Economy came we looked through our communications and found a phone number to call When I asked for a shuttle  the man who answered asked what airport are you at I said the San Diego airport and he said That office closes at 500pm I said that I had a confirmation letter that included the time of the rental and he said I dont care what you have its closed We had no car Thankfully we had not made any payment so we didnt lose any money Avis was open and we were in a car within 10 minutes
I was given tickets sitting with the away team I am sitting among Southampton fans not able to cheer I was even asked to take Tottenham Horspurs my scarf off I am super angry
Took about 2 months and a half just to tell me they will not refund me my money or resend me my order that was not received back in December
arrogant bemtande
Only took 1 week for a response
I ordered contacts 2 weeks ago and have yet to receive either the contacts themselves or an emailed acknowledgement of the order
1 The telephone waiting time is over 30 mins that is not acceptable
2 The process which I was told previously is not what has to be done
3 And I was told that there were no flights from Atlanta to Zurich that week but on Deltacom there are
Subway just delivered 1 hour anbd 15 min early and told me it was the only time they could deliver we have food catered every week We will never use them again
El envio dura muchisimo

Awful customer service 3 weeks after being told I would receive a refund and ignored by their customer service dept for a week after emailing then on numerous occasions i received an email abd waa told ww suggest you call them only to be cut off on each occasion Shocking lack of customer focus and service l
Your customer service is great my reception is not was told that even with a little rain would have no problem NOT slight rain nothing works
I sent my sample in early January Finally nine weeks later I find out that the sample is unacceptable and that they have to send me a new test Now I will have to start the process again and have another long wait to find out I have other people who sent it when I did and they have had the same outcome They should not have so many samples come in if they cannot handle the volume It is unacceptable Customer service is awful It is difficult to find a number or email When I did get someone on phone he was totally unhelpful and ignorant
So slow delivery to Scandinavia
We have booked the car in advance and our bank account has been charged at the same day We contacted the Budjet today and they didnt get our money It looks like this is the fraud We will contact the back later on  Stay away The company will be reported to FBI as well
I was supposed to receive 40 for a textbook and only received a check for 11
Ink cartridges did not work even though they were advertised for our printer Not only that but they messed up our printer so now it doesnt work at all Even when we bought the usual ones they wont work so we may have to get a new printer Am extremely discussed with this product and will not be doing business with this company ever again
Paid forvmy flight at a price of 309 then when the payment went throughBAM 70 manulife flight insurance I delined was charged to my phone Have been sitting on hold for nearly 40 minutes now waiting So not impressed
As I was leaving for a walking tour on 332017 I ordered insoles on 22217 I left for my tour on 3317 without them I followed the tracking number and the items were sent to Hermes for delivery on 22217 so presume Hermes was responsible Finally got a message from the delivery company telling me how pleased they were that they had managed to deliver my item on 5317 I suggest physio room change the delivery company nothing should take that long for delivery in the UK The two stars are for the speed I received my refund with no questions asked
I am registered with Energia for both Gas and Electricity I ordered a boiler service with Energia I would say that the service was the bare minimum passable as in the service engineer ticked all the boxes but whether or not any verificaiton of the items were done is unknown The date of the service and the sign off date were different and neither were the correct date
Finally I ordered the service with free Netatmo thermostat and I didnt receive moreover the service engineer didnt have one but advised that Energia would be contacted to send one out Needless to say I wasnt sent one When I phoned Energia to express my displeasure I found the service to be equally poor and when I asked to be contacted by a manager lo and behold I havent received a call either
Enough said I will be changing my utilities provider promptly
They sent me a brazeon derailleur when I wanted a clampon Thats what I thought I ordered  I went back and looked at the web page for the product and it clearly showed the image of a clampon derailleur The dropdown menu for the product didnt indicate it was brazeon if you check on other websites they typically do Im in the US and it would probably cost me 10 or so to return it  not worth it A disappointing experience so I would just warn people to be very careful as their labeling is sloppy NOTE I originally had a twostar review but changed it to onestar after reaching out to their customer service which basically ignored me They didnt respond to my comments at all and just sent me to a web page showing me the product had been delivered So if you have a dispute with them dont expect much
Website is ridiculous and for each time you change home need to create new account so i have change 3 times house i have at least 3 accounts multiplied by 2 because i have gas and electricity and on the same statement dont show everything Service because i order the new smart system and after 1 month later i insisted and energia says that is not possible to intall the smart system on my system after paying 200 euros in upfront on each i have seach professional advise and theres no problem
I ordered a jersey in size 1112 the item came in size 1314 instead This is the 2nd time wrong sizes have been sent and had to be returned Also i had to reorder the item seperately as unfortunately customer service are unable to arrange this In addition I had a 10 discount code and was not offered another discount code so ended up paying the full price Very disappointing and alot of hassle to sort it all out
Dont recommend this place to anyone We have bought flowers on Friday before 6pm with guaranteed delivery for Saturday for friends birthday and she has received them Monday afternoon and condition of flowers was very poor Customer service says they cant guarantee next day delivery so why on earth they put it on their website for And of course no refund what so ever
Waste of time money definitely will never use them again Stay away
I was charged 71 for insurance that I specifically chose not to purchase I got a purchase confirmation for a travel policy on my flight booking I had to call Manulife who transferred me to flight hub They told be the would refund the payment I checked my credit card statement after a number of days There was no refund I called flight hub again and they told me the cancellation was declined They never contacted me to tell me it was declined I had to call back to ask for a cancellation again They told me they would cancel again within 2 to 10 business days I spend 15 hours on the phone to try to get a charge cancelled that was never requested asked to be cancelled and Im still not certain Ill get my money back I cant recommend booking with this company Paul the supervisor employee  2016 was very polite but he was adamant the company could not process the refund within 1 hour as described in the formal company response to this known issue with the firm
did not receive product
I never do reviews but I am ticked by these people so I am doing this one I signed up for a short time just to get some wines sent around the holiday season and then a few more maybe to pick up United miles Tried to delay before my card was charged when I saw the next shipment was going to be a 125 Decided it wasnt worth that price so called to cancel at various times for a week straight and never got through I emailed to try to cancel after that was told I could only do that on the phone Then they charged my card and sent the wine anyway Now they tell me I can send it back but I have to pay the 100 shipping fee Dont waste your time go to the store
I ordered on the 15th I paid extra for expedited shipping they immediately printed the shipping label but the package was not shipped until the 20th Just because you get notice the shipping label has been printed means nothing
As of the 27th I still have not received They market Superfast shipping and then I pay for even faster laughable When customer service was notified just flower talk and no results they had lots of excuses but nothing was done WORST EXPERIENCE IVE EVER HAD ON LINE If you are disabled and need supplements AVOID THIS store which is Full Circle dba as PURE FORMULAS Absolutely Terrible Experience
Very frustrating booking process Tried about 10 times to book and the price kept increasing dramatically after I had spent time inputting all my details even within a very short amount of time The cheap prices seemed very enticing but were rarely available to book
I have rented off you many times and had the misfortune of meeting a blonde older lady at the Brisbane domestic terminal that proceeded to say she did not have the authority to not charge me for tolls I have only rented from red spot over 20 times and have never had to pay this I am still happy with everything else and will be joining the new business category as the old one has changed I have an email from Nigel with regards to this
The lady was not helpful and just passed the buck without even trying
cant edit the spelling on the forest invitation
So this is meaningless to me
I dont want to open emails like this to then find out something fairly useless to me Id rather know how many have read review  how many found it useful within 1st line too
This was Unhelpful  You have wasted this communication
Stop sending vague emails that dont immediately grab me
Enough said
I still have not heard or received my goods the day I placed an order was for 2 different orders so 2 orders the same day Confirmation of one of the orders came by email to me the next day and showed my address as my old address When placing the order I was prompted to pay by credit card of which I also posted my new address and clicked the button providing ship to same as billed to so naturally I assumed the address would have been corrected and after the confirmation I contacted customer service with the details of my concerns of not living at the address shown on the confirmation I still dont have my goods or any positive ability for Groupon to fix this and send me my orders
Ordered 2 phones Paid by CC Got email saying  we need ID CC and utility Bill Realyy

I am having an incredibly hard time accessing your add a driver page
Cannot add info to this page successfully  very frustrating and I still have to add a driver besides myself
What to do
See above The promised 10 credit was lost due to a payment procedure error
I placed an order on 122816 and my credit card was charged To date I have not received my order and the status says Dispatched I have emailed the company a couple of times but have not received a response
I recently booked a package with lastminute only then to receive an email to tell me that due to technical difficulties it had been cancelled I was told my refund had already been processed but am worried I have been scammed and wont get my money back Do I have anything to worry about
Upon purchasing the rental no other costs were disclosed to us the cost of refuelling petrol That we had to refill the tank to what it previously was only told to us upon returning the vehicle and the full sum of my bond was not refunded very disappointing
I purchased a Christmas gift on 6th December and wrote to cancel the order when it hadnt arrived by the 23rd December and I was told it hadnt yet been dispatched
No refund was provided and when I followed up on the 6th January they said they had dispatched on the 4th January so I couldnt be refunded I objected and requested the escalate After some backwards and forwards emails they finally provided a manager email I contacted him on 6th February and received no reply It is now 25th February and I have still not received the Christmas present for my son Disgraceful service
Ghost ads are appearing everywhere I thought this software blocked where is the blocking
I was sent this link to report on how well my question to eTrailer was handled I had simple questions and after two tries I gave up getting a full response I wanted to know the correct part number for the Roadmaster plugs for my CMax That took 2 responses to get but the question of how these items were kept in place was not answered in either response I dont want to keep buying them if they fall off and I had seen a review note that the person was buying replacements I received no response to that
I suggest these folks take a little more time to read and fully comprehend what is being asked So I havent purchased
I was charged x 3 times on my card for this service  which did not fix my pc anyway I was charged 6700 then another 2400 then another 2000 and I was only expecting the 6700 and the tip of 1500 which I gave thinking the problem was fixed when it was not I would not use this service again and just hope no more funds are taken out of my account
open the package Went to install the new one and it leaked all over my hands It stained my hands and took 2 weeks to it finally come off
This is day 4 and the device is malfunctioning My vehicle wont start due to a warning run wire Been on hold for 30 minutes and still no help
I had never ordered clothing from this store until this week I bought several pairs of shoes which were amazing However the two articles of clothing I received looked like someone copied a picture and made it as close as possible to what they saw which wasnt good They looked nothing like the pictures I expected more from a US factory store but I was wrong Moral of this post is shoes are a great buy but avoid buying the clothing at all cost What a disappointment
Awful 6 weeks dealing with this company Initial purchase was for a pair of trainers from their UK domain with a UK customer service number which I now know diverts to Germany Paid 395 to have the goods shipped Had to return them and was Quote d 1795 as the most cost effective way to return the trainers in their original packaging using RoyalMail I asked to be refunded this cost to which they flatly refused I was faced with no choice but to return them It took them 10 days whilst I chased for them as to whether they had received them until they acknowledged receipt and processed my refund I have since made a formal complaint and have had no response from their customer service email team despite chasing 3 times
I feel it is grossly unfair for them to proclaim to be a couk company with a UK Customer Telephone number and charge only 395 for shipping Then make it prohibitively expensive to return any goods that are incorrect
Very poor operation in this day and age
staff does not speak english and they said they will send the invoice to my email adres i m still waiting after that they charge me additional day without my confirmation
The flowers I ordered were not delivered Told the delivery driver didnt tell them if they delivered them Local florist wouldnt answer their phone
Avas Flowers wouldnt answer emails Wont let you cancel order Still charged full price minus express delivery for nothing
I think that was the plan all along
Customer service sounds like they are from a different country You cant understand their accent
This company cannot be contacted by phone You cannot reply to their emails as they come from a donotreply address They cancelled my policy because they claimed that I hadnt sent them all the information they requested without calling me or discussing anything with me I got an email on my way home from work stating that I was uninsured I dread to think how I would deal with them if I had a claim I would certainly not use them again
I pas 65 for a 24 hours delivery bought on friday expecting to have It on saturday and got It on tuesday 
I booked an Air Transat flight to Europe and found out later that the same flight actually costs less if booked directly from Air Transat I should have checked Air Transats prices first before finalizing the booking and saved myself about 75 per ticket or 225 for 3 So FlightHub does NOT have the best prices
There suppose to be free shipping with orders over 4900 im paying 1390 its a lie on there website
What a useless company They cant do my MOT on the day I requested but do they tell me NO Didnt even reply to my email So unless I had phoned them I would have been waiting all day on Monday for no one to pick up my car To top that after ther y send me an email confirming my cancellation they then phone to say they cant do the MOT and would I like to rebook Not a chance
Our agent did not follow though on using AMEX points for our trip
We were not seated together for the first leg of the trip
We were placed in the first row of seats
All unsatisfactory
Ive been overcharged by mistake
The customer service is practically nonexistent and they communicate only in English for Portuguese customers
They make digital copies of personal documents without customer permission
If you buy something from this guys over the internet stick with that and dont ask for anything at the office 
Not quite illegal but as close to the edge as you want to get I have been buying tickets for years but sadly duped by sharp practice and this is the intention of the company As mentioned before a price is displayed on top of the page including all taxes etc I know that paying by credit card there are additional costs so paid by visa debtNot a problem for this company you are going to have an additional charge whatever card you produce
After the transact the price was changed at the top of the page but you are not advised of any price change only the screen at top of the page which by chance you cant see and just to put the boot in we are now in Euros as opposed to British pound
Ok I was duped this is the first time in probably 80 typical transactionsso I supposed I was too relaxed in trusting the honesty of this company
If I get a really bored will write to my European MP about this sharp oblique practice
Please note that this is not the first time somebody has written about this problem and have they do any thing about it
We were supposed to receive our order between the 9th13th of March It is now the 15th and they have not been delivered
AVOID ProBikeKit
My order has never turned up and they keep saying they will investigate but nothing happens
I buy regularly from Wiggle Ive also bought things from Merlyn and chainreaction once or twice Ive never had any trouble at all
Tracking for my 167AUD order says that it cleared customs more than 1 month ago i have written 3 messages to ProBikeKit  they keep saying they will get back to me but they never do
Now I have to dispute the credit card payment etc etc Im sure I will get my money back from VISA but who has time for this
Use a reputable company like Wiggle or others
DO NOT USE ProBikeKit
Poor customer service hides fine print details about shipping times would not recommend them 
Ive only used Teleflora twice My first experience was fine The flowers arrived and they were pretty The second was awful I ordered a sympathy arrangement to be delivered at a church by 100 on a Saturday I got a call from someone shortly after my order asking for the name of the deceased I thought it odd but I didnt argue When I arrived at the service my flowers had NOT arrived This was after I was promised by the associate the previous day that my arrangement would be there before 100 I had to call and sit on hold after the service while I was trying to be with family to figure out what happened I was told the delivery man called the church that morning but no one answeredSo you just decided NOT to deliver them No one called ME I should of been called I get placed on hold numerous times and I tell the associate oh no Im not busy and she tells me Im welcome to hang up Um what I paid for an over priced bouquet of flowers to be delivered and they werent and youre telling me Im welcome to hang up Then she proceeds to argue with me as to who the flowers were for I ordered the flowers I think I know who theyre for After over half an hour I finally got the flowers rerouted to the home of the recipient I will NOT be using teleflora ever again Such a shame
Be careful of this company because you are going to waste your money ordering from them Shipping takes forever to Canada and after 1 and a half month of waiting finally received the product but it was broken Return was not allowed Money and time wasted Scam
If you try your watch on they consider it used and cannot be returned You are left to deal with your problem if you have one
The sales staff was friendly and helpful but the double recliner I bought is so uncomfortable that I cant stand to sit in it for very long at all
I called back to change installation date and the other Rep said my order never existed The originally Rep even told me he needed my social security number I dont know what to think now The second rep said to call another number ya right Why would I do that at this point Im really nervous as to what that was all about and would like an explanation

Please make sure you do not make use of Bravofly I booked a flight November 2016 through Bravofly On 19012017 I received an email saying there was a change in schedule The flight was cancelled and I was then booked on a later flight Unfortunately that will result in missing my connection flight I told them on the 19th of January that I cant take the later flight and asked for a refund I have written numerous emails also asking to put me on an earlier flight Today I received an email saying that they cant give me a refund If I want an earlier flight I will have to pay an airline penalty fee agency handling fees AND airline fare difference I have just realized that I have lost a lot of money I gambled when I had used Bravofly To save you a lot of trouble DO NOT MAKE USE OF BRAVOFLY
Never got a response from owner and was trying to coordinate RV spot on trip Price per day that banner displayed did not match the total was Quote d which was ok Pictures of unit were nice and unit was perfect size for our trip
I did chat with site managers they tried to help to no avail No problem I cancelled request and went with a company rental out of Houston
I booked the premium booking It was booked to be picked up by their partner DHL on a specific date between specific times I made sure I was home all day for it Nobody turned up I got an email and it said to call the Townsville office if I had any questions They knew nothing about it and made me feel very uncomfortable about the entire situation I then had to actually drop the box in myself and was not even given any tracking details This was possibly the worst parcel sending experience I have had outside Aust Post
Quick  nice and cheap and a very good car
its been a week since i ordered a pair of fans for my mimaki machine order number 100112562 its a quite simple order but to my surprise they didnt had the spare part in stock at the moment even when it showed as available in their website they sent me an email by that time saying that they had only the generic part and even so it took like 2 3 days more to answer i didnt really wanted a generic part not to mention it was cheaper and the difference between the two parts would be available as credit for my next purchase which id probably never make they should have canceled the order from that point whats that slogan for anyway Purchase before 6pm CET well ship your order the same day so yes i made a paypal claim because its been a week and i simply couldnt get the shipment information it was very delayed and i was left without any information about the order status i guess theyre just too lazy at digiprint im definitely not buying from them again word of advice
I THINK YOU MUST COMMUNICATE TO COSTUMER THAT HE HAVE TO PAY A FEE WHEN YOU RECIEVE THE GLASSES IN MY CASE I PAID ALMOST 20 DLLS 
I originally chose transferwise because they put weight in the fact that theyre fast I was told the whole process would take 14 business days My transfer took a whole 8 working days This is really frustrating especially since my recipient needed that money but now unfortunately she couldnt pay what she was supposed to thanks to transferwise Frustrating because we had the money but were unable to use it because it took 8 business days when we were told the whole process would take 14 I wouldve been more overbearing had it been with one day off but whole 4 extra days
Had I known it wouldve taken so long I wouldnt have gone with them
If you have a lot of time to spare concerning waiting time then transferwise is all ok But fast wasnt the case with me Im thoroughly disappointed in this
I recently purchased 3 books part of a big a series my son is collecting and they were marked as almost brand new and like new all 3 were marked WITH their dust covers 2 of which did not but when I recieved the books they had puppy dog ears Bend up bindings etc Def NOT even close to like new Long story short I wrote the company They offered a refund which I never got Poor Poor customer service i wont be ordering from them again Sad too because I had gotten a few good books from them in the past but they have just gone down hill lately
If you make a mistake you have to start all over instead of just correcting the mistake
Not sure if it was my mistake but I ordered 4 hoodies and ten tee shirts wanted two hoodies with one name and two with another name asnd and five  five tee shirts the same all fourteen items turned up the same and the tee shirts were a different colour printing
I would not use this service again over priced and poor quality printing
Put my car in for a service and mot didnt expect the car to pass and it didnt it Got a phone call from the guys telling me what was wrong told that I had an advisory on both brakes total cost if I wanted everything repairing 1400 if I didnt want the brakes done 700 ok I thought cars not worth that got the car back the next day looked at the mot had nothing on the advisory for brakes but for a tyre sent it in to another garage to look at what needed doing came back with a bill for 350 with mot guess where I went will not use these guys again they lie And are expensive
I have had very good items and have been very happy with most This past 2 orders have not been so good I ordered 3 sets of sheets I grey set full 1 blue set Queen 1 Lavender set King I even called after placing order and spoke with one of your Reps who changed the quantity of 1set I received 2blue Queen 1set King but no Grey full The recent chair cover came in bag marked chocolate but was a grey cover inside that was readily visible As I am 75yrs old and handicapped its hard for me to get returns off so I just give them to family members I shop on line a lot It beats kgging intend and struggling with them from stores Like I said I have been very happy with your items n print delivery andI am sorry to have to send this
On March 12th I placed an order for four items of which I received three in about a week The fourth item shows that a label has been made for it but no other activity is showing after ten days on Fedex tracking Where is my order I have purchased from Groupon before although I cant say the service is stellar it doesnt deserve a one star As for this experience there is no excuse Fedex is eating away your reliability
I can only confirm all the bad experiences many people had with getting the deposit back Dickmanns seems to do that systematically and when you call or email them they will tell you for months that your request has been passed on to accounting but nothing happens There is something you can do however Get in touch with your credit card company and start the chargeback procedure as soon as possible You will need a copy of your contract and will have to explain what happened and the credit card company will refund your deposit and charge Dickmanns Plus get in touch with the company you booked your car with and ask them to stop doing business with Dickmanns They try to rip customers off systematically and they should be out of business as soon as possible
Messaged them asking if I could switch my item to a different never heard back from them and then my stuff came and now its too small
Made an order that was shipped in 3 parcels 2 arrived but the third disappeared and still has not arrived 45days after order payment Worst helpdesk has not responded to information requests after a week
Prices are definitely good but the service is very very bad I would not use them for any order of high financial value as they do not show interest in customer service

I am Thai I book the flight with Bravofly but the flight which I book its connection time there was just 1hr at Guangzhoubut Guangzhou airport luggage have to be custom again so the connecting time will not be enough Then I called Bravofly and told them about this problem so they said they will check and a few day later there was one email sent to me that the flight was canceled from airline so I call them to cancel this booking and get me my money back
And I ready told Bravofly what I want and they said please wait a few day and I will answer you by email But a few day passed there was no any answer back Then I ask them by email they said becaus you answer late so you cannot get the refund amount which you want I ready answer by call And they said now airlineflight is alive so it will be as beforeOmg after the email informed me that flight was canceled by airlineand after I answer that I want refundI ready bought another ticket ready
But it cannot do anything and I am tried to talk with Bravofly so I said just return the refund to me  they said it will take 10days So I said its okay But after 10days but no any refund back then I sent email and asked about progress And the reply email is the take some days Then I think it will be okay and it will be the lesson and next time I will not book any booking with Bravofly But it is not the endtoday one email sent to me that the the refund will be 477eurosbefore was 1652 and have answer today
Too ba agentplease do not book any booking with them
Had an issue with my order Customer service had kind of a too bad you should have been more careful attitude Ordering process is somewhat confusing
So I was on formspringspring me a very long time ago the ask questions by you friends part and apparently you find it acceptable to take my details and put me onto you dating site and put me Down as single and looking in London I dont even live there without my knowledge I just happened to look in my spam folder and found you kept sending me emails I thought it was spam but then decided to check it out because of the Number of emails I was receiving do you think it unethical to take thousands of QA site users sign them up to a dating site  send their details to each other I feel its disgusting and that people should receive a email asking if they would like to be moved i have now deleted my account
Ive called four times now trying to resolve a problem with my iTunes and two of those four times I got hung up on The very first time I was hung up on the person had an attitude when picking up the phone asking how he could assist me after explaining the problem calmly there was complete silence for about 10 seconds and then they just hung up The second time I was on hold for about 20 minutes before I was eventually hung up on Apples customer service team is by far the worst and rudest customer service I have ever encountered
First iTunes gift card of 100 was already redeemed by someone else After contacting support I received a replacement code To my dismay the 100 replacement card had also been redeemed by someone else
Support said they were sorry I was having trouble with my codes which is not the case They simply sent me used gift cards Whether its due to incompetence or if they got their gift cards stolen by hackers I dont know
I have screenshots of both instances as proof since I see people with similar experiences here being discredited
Ive had to contact PayPal to dispute the payment well see how it goes from there
Update Got a refund from PC Game Supply but this also means theyre not able to supply the gift cards I need and arent able to service a paying customer
They offered a free phone power pack for orders over a certain limit When ordering I GOT CONFIRMATION THAT MY ORDER QUALIFIED It didnt arrive and when I queried it I was told I had ordered the day before the offer came live They didnt want to know after that Why have it live on their site if it does not apply Normally good but very poor this time
Although the process of booking was fine We do not travel to Queenstown until mid Maywhen we will take the rental I find it rather frustrating that payment has been taken as soon as I booked When the travel is still 3 months away I have not found this before
I will not be using this facility again

They also wanted me pay extra 200 for something I never got

BUYER BEWARE I WOULD NEVER EVER PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN
Purchased 7 items on 121116 Items were to be Christmas gifts for people I see  Jan 10th Told 1525 day delivery so I thought timing would be ok
HA  what a joke
4 arrived Feb 1st 2017 in plastic mailer directly from China
1 arrived Feb 10th 2017  Display box EXTREMELY DAMAGEDIt was
delivered in a plastic mailer mailed directly from China
The bag appeared fine but obviously was run over or stepped on
or something to have caused the packaging box to have that type
of trauma I am certainly not able to give it as a gift
2 arrived Feb 28th 2017 Display boxes both partly damaged would
not give as a gift Again in a plastic mailer directly from China
I wrote to the company AND sent photos They were extremely slow to reply Have not responded to my request for a replacement or refund
I ordered a set of bags as well as a tail light relocation kit for my 16 Harley Dyna Street Bob I was very excited to get my bags after ordering as i have wanted to put bags on my bike for a while now but simply didnt pull the trigger on it But upon receiving my bags and tail light kit i found that the tail light relocation kit i soon discovered that i needed to do multiple alterations on the bracket to make it work for my bike Then i discovered that after relocating the lights the bags still would not fit on my bike between the shock and the lights I called viking bags and spoke to someone who told me that everyone had gone home for the day and that they would call me back the next morning between 9am and 10am the next day 1030am passed and i still received no phone call So i called back i was asked for my order number so i gave that then i was put on hold for THIRTY minutes So i hung up and called back immediately asking to speak to a manager The first guy who answered the phone said that he was a manager i explained the problem and he told me that he has never heard of this happening before I told him that i wanted different bags with a cut out for the shock and i wanted them over night shipped to me for the inconvenience he said that he could do that and that i would be getting them the next day He also told me that i would get shipping confirmation at around 4 or 5pm that day i never got shipping confirmation so i decided id call back while they were still open At that time i was informed that my bags in fact were not shipped out and that they would be shipped out on Monday friday being the day i called and they told me they would be over night delivered on saturday So not only did the guy not do what he told me he was doing for me to rectify the situation but i was not even informed that now i would not have my bags until tuesday When i called back they offered me 40 off of the order because of the inconvenience and i had no real choice in the matter because i needed bags on my bike so i accepted When i finally got the bags on that following Tuesday i tried to install them on my bike and low and behold they did not fit either They would have overlapped my tail lights by a good two inches So being fed up with the company as it was i decided that i would just go replace my tail lights with LED low profile lights only because i needed to replace them which i was not trying to do To top it all off i put the new bags on my bike and THEY RATTLE as im driving down the road the lids move on them pretty badly and it is causing material to be rubbed away on my brand new bags because of this fact So now i have to modify this product even more and put some sort of black weather strip tape or something on the bags so the lids dont move as much and they dont rattle on the bike im very unhappy with the end result on this order i will never order from this company again VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER RIGHT HERE Which is unfortunate because the first bags i was shipped i really liked and felt they were great quality
I booked a flight for my daughter I dont know how they messed up when she showed up at the airport the airline company told her that she was not bookedshe missed her flight I called Flighthub to enquire what went wrong They told me to contact the airline I called the airline and they said they have no record of her flight and that I should go back to Flighthub I called them again finally they admitted that they made a mistake and that they were going to refund the money But that was one way of getting rid of me Since Oct 2016 up to now I have called 14 times asking for the refund Every time I call it falls to deaf ears Their agents are useless and unable to help Now I see that they are just crooks that I will never get my money back My advice hope that everything goes OK but dont expect to get any help once they mess up with your flight and you get stranded at the airport I dont trust them any more
Totally unsatisfactory
I booked a flight through an online website from Melbourne to Buenos Aires with Qantas many months ago Yesterday I realised that my name was the wrong way around so my first name Maria was listed as my last name and vice versa I just found out that Qantas wont simply change the name around but they have a rule that the ticket must be purchased again
Any person with common sense would see this as a common mistake that could be made so easily by anyone and evidently it is very clear that Maria is my first name But no Qantas wants me to purchase another ticket for roughly 3500 which is totally outrageous
To save yourself such shocking customer care if some tiny error is made please do not book with this airline They show absolutely no good will to customers but instead require exorbitant amounts for tiny mistakes that could be rectified without much effort on their part  just using common sense
I will now look to any other airline that values their customers compared to the service and care I have received from Qantas
I had a customer bought something electrical they had removed all warranty stickers leaving VOID all over the item yet PayPal decided to refund them They could have just swapped the internal parts for a faulty one and got them selves a free working replacement for their faulty item and put me 70 down the drain
What is the point in me protecting myself with warranty stickers if PayPal are just going to ignore people that remove them
SHOCKING
I guess if you just complain about anything you get your money back so if you cant beat them join them
Steer clear System rigged to scam
Got a giftcard for christmas First you type in your giftcard code and press cash in choose your giftcard and get a confirmation message about the giftcard being delivered in 35 working days Then a month after contacting their super dodgy customer service they ask for the giftcode that i obviously didnt have laying around after cashing it in and getting a confirmation message that my ciftcard was on its way Then they say that without it the case is closed from their side
Either they have a system developed by a todler or judging by the customer service they have a system intentionally rigged to scam
From my experience as a customer service manager the measure of any companys customer service can be seen in the way they react to customer problems Therefore it is no good Amoma putting We are always thinking about your satisfaction on its website when it obviously doesnt mean a thing Finally to end your reply with regards just adds insult to injury Where are the regards

Rented a car in the Dominican Republic from them but when I got there the rental car company Thrifty told me I needed to pay an additional 75 for insurance I didnt need almost doubling the cost of the rental I called Rentalcarscom and got an email from them saying theyd reverse the charges Its 2 months later and nothing has been done despite my following up many times Other sites give them terrible reviews its fishy that Trustpilot has so many glowing reviews of them Never use them
I had to cancel my policy as I sold my car Its an impossible task to try and 1 Contact a member of staff 2 receive clear instruction once they finally do call you back and 3 they make the process as impossible as they can After all that I was not entitled to a partial refund again this was never communicated during the endless over and back sessions during this process This level of poor communication is unacceptable and there will be no repeat business within my family
First the hot tub was so nastywe couldn t even get in it Call the office and maint they said it was clean but after we check out they would have to acid wash it  it would take 2 daysThe fireplace glass in the bedroom was so dirty you couldn t see the fire The wallpaper in the bedroom was falling off the walls and someone had tape it back up This was the first time we had use Colonial properties and it will be my LASTI had look at all the reviews on this cabin and many more before we book this oneAlso i look in the book in the cabin that people had wrote about and i seen were pages Had been removed from itnow i no why So thanks Colonial Properties for a great weekend NOT
My pretty much new car went in for a service It came back with over 600 pound worth of things needing doing I said no and took it to a different garage They confirmed that half some of the things did not need doing and completed the work that did for 100 pound nearly 400 cheaper than what they tried to charge They were even more expensive than the dealer Avoid avoid avoid
I didnt not get help as expected when called flighthub had to wait long periods of time on phone line and the information that fligthub should have provided was given by the airline was given run around to get anywhere
also the refund I was to receive was not clear will be calling centre again
My car was collected without a problem at the agreed time About half an hour later I was phoned by a man from Servicing Stop although it would have taken that long to get ton the garage to be told my car needed a long list of advisories including brake fluid change pollen filter engine flush Lots of standard things He then tried to do me a deal and charge only 400 for this work 
After requesting that none of this be completed and just the standard service be done he tried to help me out by asking if there was a Mr R because fellas are quite good at these things He then tried to backtrack on these comments when he realised how sexist he sounded and continued to dig sounding much worse
After I declined again he lost interest in being polite and quickly confirmed the price then hung up
Later he called back and tried to sell me the exact same services again with the same script When I pointed out wed already had this conversation he then tried to sell me on MOT advisories in a really patronising tone He said altogether the work was 1200 plus the previous 400 that I needed
Different garage Quote d 200 for all advisories Nice
Much of the items found here purport to give comfort to people with varying levels of disability in particular the items unfortunately are aimed towards the elderly the very members of society who can least afford not receiving value for money spent and who are more than likely to be desparate for helpany kind of helpeven from companies that basically sell items which are little more than a novelty item at best I ordered compression socks advertised as low compression and XL size The socks that arrived were way too tight and certainly were not XLback they went at a cost for me almost equal to what i was charged for the itemthus out of 10 right off the bat Diabetic socks received were so flimsy that holes appeared after the first wearing After these experience needless to say i threw all the catalogs form this company in the trashwhere they will go from now on
i have receive my parcelADIDAS X WHITE MOUNTAINEERING NMD TRAIL PK Collegiate Navy  White in a bad condition the boost got a mark that i cant clean it have to return it
Received the tickets 1 working day before the event left me uneasy an stressed as I paid a lot of money for tickets which I thought werent coming
The tickets were extremely over priced but as there was no other tickets being sold anywhere I was left with no option but to order from them
I paid 400 for the tickets and the face value of the tickets is 2350 each Im not even watching a top team Im watching Chelsea v Crystal Palace
Bought the tickets in January and after I had already bought the tickets they then only decided to tell me the seats I had were restricted view AFTER I had paid the full amount Got in contact with them as I wasnt happy  if I wanted to change the tickets I could but I had to pay an extra 50
Why they dont display it as pounds either I dont know Makes it annoying as I wasnt 100 on the amount coming out of my account
The seller never ever put on my account that the tickets were dispatched as I was given a link to track my order was told theyd be here by the 27th I panicked an contacted the company as I didnt think theyd come in time The match was Saturday and I still hadnt reveiced them on the Tuesday Their response was well contact the seller and asked me for the address of the hotel I was staying at so they could send my tickets to this hotel
Dont understand how a company can think it is acceptable to deliver such a high valued purchase to a hotel how is that even secure
So yes massively over priced werent delivered on the day they said they would be and they have very little communication with the sellers
Also forgot to mention as soon as I said I was interested in buying the tickets they rang me within 5 minutes as soon as I asked where my tickets were all I had was a lousy email Shows thats all theyre concerned about is the money they make

Customer service sent a enquiry on behalf of a guest via email and phone call
Was unable to answer the phone call but responded to the email within 2 hours  general requirement is within 24 hours As I was unable to respond to the call the Customer service rep threatened to suspend my account
Its bad enough when you call Holiday Lettings it takes so long to speak to someone aswell as needing to negotiate through a variety of automated messages they then have the nerve to be so disrespectful over not sitting by a phone allday being able to answer a phone call It doesnt matter if the email was answer almost instantly nor the fact have a 100 response rate
The employees should take a look at trip advisors stock price you can see its a sinking ship and its no wonder why with the attitude of the customer service

You need to work on your website It takes forever to find things Its very frustrating to find something you like click on it and find out that its out of your size or style If there is a way to filter by size or style and a little easier to use it would make a big difference I had a hard time picking something that I wanted to buy
Over priced and was promised one car and ended up with another I hated it Also wasnt clean and the person who was handling the paperwork was rude and wanted to charge me for their mistake Unfortunately because of my emergency situation I haf no choice but to just take it I will never ever due buisness again
I have been a UPS customer for years and there have been nonstop issues like damage in transit and delivery problems but this time it has gone too far  a large box was scanned as delivered exactly at the time when I was at the delivery address with witnesses I have contacted the UPS and waiting for their response but previously their responses were less then helping so I am just waiting for them to respond with whatever so I can take this up with the police had enough
To remove the fee is not possible online it needs email correspondence
Bought a ticket to Book of Mormon in Melbourne two hours before the show The purchase went through smoothly 5 stars with email delivery within minutes promised But an hour later the tickets had still not been emailed 1 star The website was no help at all 0 stars and the feedback form only produced an automated response 1 star Hidden deep within the website thankfully found by Googles bots was their call centre number 1300 651 607 Spoke to a human being and they sent my tickets 10 minutes before the show Thankfully the PDF barcode could be scanned from my mobile phone screen The anxiety of waiting for an email response was more exciting than the show itself
Summary CALL THEM AT 1300 651 607
I ordered 2 pair of glasses on 18th dec 2016 One was vogue and the other was Kate spade I used my MasterCard for payment I gave them the address I received my vogue glasses in 3 weeks after ordering  I havent received my Kate spade glasses until now Seems they dont have the frame and they are fooling me around that they sent the glasses and it has been returned If I can receive a pair of glasses from vision direct on the address I gave how can the other pair of glasses be returned if sent the same address
I have bought tickets few times on this website and each time it was awful experience Customer service is disgusting and did not even let you finish what you want to say or explain  5 stars are definitely fake reviews 
Please please avoid
I received my shipment and the items were cracked and one item was broken in half I requested a label so I could ship it back and all I kept getting is that I have to pay for the shipment to be returned I think that I shouldnt have to pay for it since my shipment was damaged They still wont give me a label to send it back Its costing me more money to ship it back and I dont have the money 128 is a lot I only have 30 days to get it back or I have to pay for the whole item Customer service wasnt very helpful all I kept getting is that I have to pay to send it back but I supposed to hear from UPS But I dont even know if there coming to pick it up The lady in customer service wouldnt give me a straight answer when I asked questions about the UPS Im not going to do business with them ever again
Anulem a encomenda
The problem was fixed right away but i was given an offer that i didnt sign Then later on in the morning as i considering my finance i was thanked for signing my paperwork and was to be funded immediately i called to get the situation rectified and it was but the circumstances were unsettling
I bought a glass protector for my Moto G4 PLUS as I read on the product description Some days later I received the product but it was for Moto G4 Obviously did not fited on my cellphone but I just noticed after already opened the pack so I could not request the change
In the end I paid for the product and delivery tax for nothing and I put the glass protector out
The phone case that I bought is good but I can not recommend this website after my experience
Sent installer defective equipment causing me to miss 2 days of work Costin me over 400
I bought some flowers with this company for my wife for Valentines day 14th as date of delivery was requested I ensured that they were ordered in good time for such a busy day
It was extremely disappointing to arrive home after work on the 13th to find that the flowers had been delivered around 930am on that day Not only that the flowers began to wither and die within two days My son bought some flowers for his mum on the 14th a lot cheaper and they are still going strong
I contacted the Prestige Flowers regarding this and whilst they were apologetic around the delivery and offer of 10 voucher to be used with their company I felt it to be totally inadequate and unacceptable as I would not be using them again
I have booked a short break to Paris in June for my mother in laws birthday We had to book to stay seperately from them as we are on a lower income We used last minute who Quote d us a decent price but the train times were not as needed We selected to chose different train times as my daughter has to be at school the next day and had to pay an extra 28 Then when we went through and paid we receive the old train times on our booking and not selected ones We have been on and off the phone with last minute and they are blaming us They dont know how their website works and have been totally incompetent We have just received an email from them stating we need to pay another 45 to change the times of our train and say the extra was booking fees that werent clearly stated Im astonished that such a well known company can treat people like this and offers terrible customer service I wont be using them again as they have put us in a hard position now for what was meant to be an enjoyable time
Was using this service to book flights with a group of friends and it was extremely difficult to find the same flights for all of us Sometimes the flights werent even displayed on one computer while they were on all the others Also a huge disappointment when during checkout the price jumps a huge amount
For a small change initiated by the airline I was asked to call them early February At that first call I was put on hold for 30 minutes I agreed to the changes and requested that a new itinerary be sent to me They never did Two days ago they sent me another email to call them about a waiver I thought it was a different issue So I called them last night and was put on hold 45 minutes After waiting all that time the FlightHub rep told me that she could not update my itinerary for that very same change as the first time and told me to call back to confirm At that time I lost my temper and reprimanded them for their incompetence and that I would never book with them This morning I contacted the airline directly The whole call took less than 5 minutes and a revised itinerary was emailed to me right away FlightHub has a lot of room for improvement in their customer service
My experience did not start out well Different message every time I called However when I posted my frustration the manager ensured that my sunglasses were on the way the next day That is paying attention to ensure excellent customer service Thoroughly enjoying my prescription sunglasses My first pair
Thank you

Yesterday I sent in another order and wanted to find out if there were more copies in very good condition I was unable to contact customer service because they would only accept the question they had in their p reformatted boxes Overall extremely poor customer service
Hello  my latest order is my 4th project with Discmakers and unfortunately Ive had a problem with each purchase
1st order in 2013 came with defective discs  they were shrink wrapped so I couldnt necessarily do a physical inspection of every disc but customers would complain that their CDs were either scratched or broken
2nd order in summer 2015 there was an issue where the CD labels themselves were really really low quality not due to the file given Apparently I didnt order the HQ label even though nothing in the proof showed me how pixelated and noisy it would actually show It took 3 different revisions to get it right
The 3rd order in Dec 2015 was forgotten about I had to send a message to a rep who then placed the order again
This last order included a booklet The pdf supplied were up to specs 300dpi etc but it came out fuzzy And though it was in full color the last page which was intentionally greyscale looked the worst out of all of them  the text is pretty ineligible
Doubt Ill ever order from Discmakers again Ive spent nearly 2000 and have been disappointed each time
Dont use themproduct doest arrive
Rot slecht
The Service is shabby all over the chain more than a month to ship the phone with the argument is not yet available in the store knowing that when i ordered it it was available on the site
The delivery took 1 month
The phone comes with an earphone problem that does not work
After contacting the customer service and spending more than two months in chating with them or they have made me lose much time to finally suggest to me to send the phone with unrealistic conditions Please see below

The price information given to me from Sparefoot was not accurate I was under the impression the person I was talking to knew what they were talking about Fast forward to my appointment on move in day as Sparefoot calls it
For one she didnt know we were coming Didnt even have the space available I had an appointment to see When I asked the site owner about the discrepancy she said shes been asking Sparefoot to remove the incorrect info off their site We took her last space while there She didnt even have any covered spaces available The gate is not 24 hours as I was shown online and on the phone

I was sending a gift basket to my fianc for his birthday  After telling them what hotel he was giving them address and room number also giving them my work number cell number and his cell number plus contacting the hotel Avas attempted delivery to the vegas hotel instead of the Reno hotel After numerous calls from me to them I was assured it would be delivered still that day The next day it was still not delivered Now fighting to get my money back They refunded part of my transaction but took out a delivery fee They also wanted more money to deliver although it was them who attempted delivery at the wrong hotel after I clarified address repeatedly Never once did the driver contact us at any number left with them I will never use them again
I complained about Tour Center two months ago They replied that they dealing with it and I never heard anything ever since I never received an email asking if any action has been taken Knowing how the Tour Center treaded me and reading other websites reviews the ones you published are not right
Arrive at rental desk only to be told no cars left Told unable to contact as no telephone number or email address This was completed when making booking thro car Hire Labs but not passed onto rental company for some reason
No contact from Enterprise or Car Hire Labs which is poor and worse still no contact 15hrs later after asking Car Hire labs for response and return of deposit Never again
Wanted to reschedule the dates but was just not able to get in touch They do not respond also properly through mail or website Horrible will never use this ever
I specifically requested unlimited mileage when I got to pick up my car I specifically asked if I could pay partly cash and partly on my card I was advised that yes I could When I dropped off my car I was told I could not and all was charged on my card when I asked the agent three times to not do that I walked way quite fuming and low and behold I got an overdraft on my account What did Budget offer me A 50 coupon  no thank you I WILL NEVER GO THROUGH RENTAL CARS I was told by Budget it did not matter if my request through RentalCars was unlimited mileage they charge after 1050 Worst experience Now I am stuck paying over the allotted mileage and over draft fees Thanks for nothing

Postage was very expensive and I had to pay for my own return I only bought a cap to be shipped to uk Cost me over 20 in total to ship and then return to get a refund

I have just received a phone call to say that they can no longer pick up my car for its service and MOT tomorrow When I was put through to the garage they said I could drop in off myself 45mins away but they cant guarantee they will fit me in It is 1930 and now I dont have time to book it in anywhere else before my mot runs out Appalling service I will be warning all my friends not to go anywhere near this company
Car was picked up on time but was not delivered back to me the same day like I was told I called them to ask why it hadnt been returned and was told they didnt know and it should have been but after managing to get hold of the actual mechanic who did the work I was told that they were informed by 1pm that day that it wouldnt be ready until the next morning Caused me
unnecessary stress and worry and not happy with the experience so will not be using them again
We were in the market for a mattress We loved my mothers and asked which mattress she purchased When I called Gardner White I was told that they never carried the mattress style Gardner White carried the brand but not the style I asked which was most like the one I was interested in The sales associate just said I would need to come in I then called two other stores and was educated about mattresses and one even said they didnt make the one my mother had but there is one like it We decided to give all three stores a chance and visited each After visiting all three we called Gardner White to purchase our new mattress I was told that our fantastic sales associate Kimmwas with other customers and would call us back After at least an hour I called back and was connected to Kim I asked if she got our message and was told no She heard her name being called and when she asked was told there werent any messages We ordered our mattress including the mattress pad to ensure our warranty would remain intact This was on Sunday I also let Kim know that I wasnt available for delivery until after 2 pm the following Friday She wrote down the information I got a phone call at 10am saying they would deliver my mattress between 11am1pm I asked how that was possible I asked if they had any instructions on delivery as far as time restraints They said yes that I requested after 2pm I asked if I could have a later delivery time I was told it wasnt possible and would either have to be at home or reschedule deliver I had to have my son who is in medical school come home to meet the delivery man When the mattress was delivered there wasnt a mattress pad I have waited now at least a week for the mattress pad to be delivered Your company has given me the run around I received a phone call asking if I had received the pad I asked why they would not know whether it was delivered I was suppose to get a phone call back letting me know if it was sent via mail I then called corporate customer service who told me you are out of mattress pads I explained that I just received a phone call asking if I got the mattress pad and if not did I want to pick one up I said I didnt understand how that could be They told me to call the store They might have some I called the store and was told that one would be mailed out I asked why one wasnt mailed since the delivery man said it would I also asked this past Wednesday if they would call me when the mattress pad was sent It is Friday night and I HAVE NOT HEARD from your company When someone pays close to 4000 dollars for a mattress you would think you would get better service

At the desk they try to sell you all sorts of unessential additions rather aggressively As we did not purchase any additional insurance they charged us the excess The exemption to normal situation was that they actually charged it a 1100 euro sum it wasnt just a reservation Now a month and a half later the money has not returned into our account even though the car was returned in good condition and return was signed off by the company
They refuse to reply emails and by phone they always give the same answer to send them our detail by mail and the financial dep will take care of the rest Nothing happens The HQ in Spain is not helping either in their system our deposit has been released We are not giving up yet and are tryiong to sort the thing out with the Cyprus office
The point is if you travel to Cyprus or anywhere else and happen to find a good car rental under the name of Goldcar please use some consideration you might not get your money back
This is Feb 27 2017 and MY rental with you is JUNE 2017
SO when you ask me in Feb about how my experience is with you IT WOULD BE BETTER TO WAIT until AFTER my rental Then I will have a better idea
even though the host has not accepted yet
my personal expierience
there is no justification for this kind of behaviour
as a company policy to charge a guest fro a potential booking is hardly legal
Tried to enroll in the trial period and was given the runaround by a lame named Brent who couldnt even call back like he said he would When I finally got ahold of the guy he said that I needed 90 days as a seller to qualify Uh hello Ive been selling for 4 years If your gonna supposedly do a review of my account and lie at least know what your talking about Very small company with nothing but excuses Their best one is that theyre a new companylol If you look into it or start asking a lot of questions theyll start ignoring you They have some very shady business practices that should be reported to the authorities The fees are not worth it and theres a lot that this company does not tell you Do your homework on them and weigh other options before you use these guys Website is very vague and doesnt tell you anything Red flag company to me You really dont need them if you run your business right Heck read these other bad reviews they cant even manage your money right Theyll rob you if you dont pay attention Theyre just after your hard earned moneyyouve been warned As you can see Now they reply to me below because I left them an honest review of my experience They did not notify me immediately about anything I had to call myself The response below is a complete lie and that should be all the proof you need about how shady this company is I met all the requirements and I sell consistently everyday Wow what a joke these guys are Keep lying and doing your customers wrong it will only hurt you and your company in the end Ill make sure to let everyone I know about these guys and Ill share this review everywhere possible if you reply with some crap again that isnt true
I wanted to book a return flight to Sofia for 90 euros
When booking trying to pay the site kept loading and came back to the original page with my personal info
But the prices were increased with 20 euro I thought the airline made it more expensive so I bought the tickets
When receiving my confirmation of the airline I saw the original price on the tickets So lastminutecom took my 20 euros
Never booking with them again
I purchased a few months back and had so many troubles two weeks of troubles that gardner white gave me a 100 gift card I decided last week to use theh gift card and give them another chance Upon delivery one guy put on shoe covers and the other two did not When they started taking the plastic off my chair I had noticed that one of the guys did not have shoe covers on and was stepping all over a brand new rug in my lkiving room Before I could say anything he was back out the front door They tried to screw the inserts onto the chair and their was no holes to put the feet on Then their was a tear on the side of the chair They had to take the chair back and I had to reschedule the delivery I understand their are mistakes we are all human but come on now Both times I ordered from gardner white I had less than extrordinary experiances
Pssimo servio interfase confusa No usarei novamente
See above title  that says it all
Gave up after three attempts to order and was sent wrong item Suggested Groupon contact their vendor Obviously never happened
The setting up was very difficult because of the ridiculous crappy wrench that only tightens SOME of the bolts and the direction on setting up the equipment were all over the place
Absolutely DO NOT use this service or JerseyMotorsINC I am a young college student who spent every last penny on what I thought was the car I had worked so hard for and the transmission went exactly a month after purchasing Prior to that I had to replace the alternator Now Im out my 500000 and have no car to get to school or work Thanks trucar
On the 27th of January I placed an order and paid for a remote control for Hrmann HSE 1 BS on there site with a delivery of about 7 working days On the status page for the order it stated that it was shipped on the 6th of February but with no tracking ID Today its the first of March an I havent received the shipment I have sent 2 questions through there contact form but havent received any kind of respons other than an automatic answer saying that they will answer within 24 hours the first I sent more than a week ago I suppose I have to come to term with that I have been cheated for almost 500 SEK about 52
Too many bogus jobs on site  decent site lets you know when a employer looked at your resume But I think it needs some tweaking to root out all the junk
Awful liars Untrustworthy If there was a zero star choice they didnt earn it If you have an option choose the option Please If you have ever used a review to make a decision I strongly advise you to heed my warning
seems like they dont care Once you spent your money If theres a problem they drag the feet on it To get it resolved
There are no assembly instructions  youll open up your parks to separated parts with no idea how to fix them together  and the frame itself is quite flimsy
They add extra things so be sure to double check what you sign and what youre paying for
My husband and his friends booked a trip with Tripsta from Copenhagen to Mnchen for Oktoberfest 2017 The trip is with an SAS flight from CPH and a return flight with Transavia A couple of months ago Transavia oh do not even get me started on their non existing customer care contacted us explaining that they have changed the return flight for the day before If tis was not suitable for them Transavia would refund the tickets Great we asked for a refund because they wanted to stay that extra day
So now when we ask Transavia where the money is they tell us that they refunded the amount ca DKK 2500 to Tripsta weeks ago Of course we cannot get trough to Tripstas customer care because it does not exist so no money no tickets and a bitter taste that we should have been much better at checking the reviews here because then we NEVER would have chosen a booking agent with a reputation like this
Stealing is a crime last time I checked
I was disappointed when I put in the ink cartridge cyan in the printer and had not printed a few sheets and the ink level showed 14 used Also the black cartridge did not print  all other colours were showed on the nozzle check but not the black in spite of putting and changing another new one
Daughter aged 20 applied for loan and i acted as guarantor answered all relevant questions online and also in person over phone person over phone seemed very arrogant to be honest and not very helpful when i asked questions this was bfore exmas didnt hear from them for over a month and then only got back when and after daughter rang them and they recontacted me could offer no explaination as to why taken so long however loan was finally approved and paid out within 2 days and most say the second person was very helpful got there in the end would i use amigo again probadly would 
Customer Service not helpful they cancelled my orders without waiting

Hello folks i have been doing business with your company for the last four years and they have all being exceptional except the last one It has been a comedy of errors and frustration regarding the correct accessories
I ordered the ETAC 2 with the Wall Sleeve the Grill and the Remote control Kit First the Grill that I specifically ordered was the Designer Aluminum grill instead I received the Stainless steel This does not weather well near the ocean so it was totally useless to me I had a spare Aluminum and I was force to use it As far as the remote kit it came in with the wrong module When I reorder the correct one still had the wrong module so I proceeded to order it again this time only to received the Remote Control and not the Module Al Nieto has all the emails that we have been exchanging for the last month I consider myself a loyal customer who will stay doing business with the same company as long as I dont have any issues however Im frustrated and at a point that I no longer trust the knowledge of your staff Consider this comment as someone who no longer thinks that I will get any positive business transaction and will explore my alternative

Thank you for writing back
I apologize for the delay in our response It appears that you have already filed a dispute with PayPal which has inadvertently locked your account lie I would be happy to help you with your refund but since I am unable to access your account lie they just have to press a button you will need to cancel the dispute first so that we can proceed with the refund absolutely atrocious LIE LIE LIE If you decide to cancel the dispute simply write back to us and we would be happy to assist you further so i did this and they did not give me a refund even after saying they did By cancelling the claim i lost my seller protection which meant they do not have to give me a refund after speaking to paypal and did this to mislead me Which was completely unacceptable I will never shop with them again and would insist no one else does if they like to purchase from honest companies unlike this one
Ordered a TV stand 50000 When delivered three guys brought in piece by piece to assemble saying they dont usually assemble and would just need to look over directions to try and assemble There were scratches and poor quality Called salesman and store manager Taylor who was actually rude neither could do anything I had the delivery guys take back piece by piece Took over two weeks to finally deliver one that was actually assembled before brought to my home
It has been six days since Gardner White said they would be in contact with me As of Monday March 20 2017 no one has contacted me Once again poor customer service They cant even followup as they said they would
ink catridges didnt work no help from inksation
So I have used Bravofly before and found them to be okay However on this occasion they have been so unhelpful it is almost laughable I booked through Bravo for flights to and from Indonesia for my honeymoon departing from Adelaide The airline had to cancel my flights meaning I had to book new flights at the airport The airline informed me I was entitled to a full refund which they returned to Bravofly
This is where it gets messy Bravofly recieved my full refund of 1026 AUD in January Since then I have called several times constantly being told that Bravofly is looking into the matter They have never called me back to inform me of any changes to the situation as they promised they would The customer service center will not allow me to speak to any sort of manager or supervisor Today the man I spoke to on the phone raised his voice got angry at ME and told me to wait while they continue to look into the matter He was so rude that I took his name to make a formal complaint Almost 2 months later and I am beginning to think that I may as well say goodbye to that money
It was bad enough that my honeymoon started so poorly with an airline cancellation but hey that happens and its okay The problem is that Bravofly is now compounding the problem by refusing to send money that it doesnt even own back to a customer that until this episdoe was a repeat customer How can Bravofly justify this in good conscience 1000 may not be much to a large company but to the regular family it is significant and they are having a big impact on people lives
Use this company at your own risk if things go wrong do not expect a speedy or even reasonable resolution
The freezer was OK My online experience was OK The delivery unfortunately was terrible The guys were behind with their deliveries that day that they barely had time to get the freezer into the house before they ran back out again They had no time to talk to me about it level it or do anything besides turn it on and put the handle on They left no papers and made me feel that I could not hold him up to ask anything at all It was a very rushed experience which I would not do to someone else I felt that I had been brushed aside It made me feel like someone was delivering newspapers and just threw it on the lawn and left Sorry thats not how I would run RC Willey deliveries
Hi this competition was a very important event and diet is crucial My food arrived very late after 2 days of travel and I was not able to eat anything It was hard as i was depending on this food i requested to order and ship food early but this was rejected The food was supposed to arrive in the afternoon and showed up finally around 7 pm and was frozen i wasnt able to eat anything and had to let the food thaw out I was very disappointed The food was good but the delivery was very late and came frozen
Prebooked a hire car from Goldcar rental through AutoEurope Paid an all inclusive price for the car including additional refundable excess insurance online before leaving the UK and arranged to pick up the car from Palma Mallorca Airport After queueing for over 90 minutes at the Goldcar desk but thats another story I handed over confirmation of booking to the Goldcar representative who then asked to swipe my credit card supposedly to cover any deficiency in fuel upon return of the car which I agreed to They hand you a PDA with a blank screen to sign and then superimpose your signature onto a digitally created agreement which they then put into a folder and hand to you I returned the car at the end of the hire period unmarked and with a full tank of fuel 4 weeks after my trip I received my credit card statement to find that Goldcar had deducted 23581 more than the actual cost of the car hire from my credit card for additional insurance which was neither discussed nor agreed to This is shocking and fraudulent behaviour and according to AutoEurope not an uncommon practice by Goldcar Following protracted correspondence with Goldcar Customer Services they maintain that Ive had the benefit of the insurance so will not reimburse me AutoEurope have purportedly investigated but quite frankly a complete waste of time
If you must use Goldcar for car hire QUESTION AND THOUROUGHLY CHECK WHAT YOU ARE SIGNING FOR BEFORE YOU WALK AWAY FROM THE DESK Goldcar have now had my money for 269 days
NOTE TO GOLDCAR  PLEASE DO NOT KEEP POSTING YOUR INANE COMMENTS I HAVE PREVIOUSLY CONTACTED YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICES DEPARTMENT WHO DID NOT PROVIDE A SATISFACTORY RESPONSE PLEASE JUST ANSWER THE FOLLOWING POINTS AS REQUESTED
1 GIVEN THAT YOU WERE AWARE THAT I HAD PURCHASED REFUNDABLE EXCESS INSURANCE AS PART OF MY DEAL WITH AUTOEUROPE WHY WERE THE TWO INSURANCE OPTIONS NOT MENTIONED AT THE TIME OF COLLECTING THE CAR YOU JUST DEBITED 23581 FROM MY CREDIT CARD WITHOUT EVEN ASKING OR DISCUSSING IT THIS IS EFFECTIVELY THEFT
2 WHY WOULD I LOGICALLY AGREE TO TAKE OUT THE OPTION OF YOUR SUPER RELAXED COVER WHEN I ALREADY HAD THE BENEFIT OF REFUNDABLE DEPOSIT COVER FROM AUTOEUROPE
You have my contact details should you wish to discuss however as I have previously stated I will keep posting this review until you refund my money in full

I paid more than 500 to get Tickets which are not worth 190 Here in Germany this is illegal I just got the Tix when i already arrived in the USA so i cant get some other ones
Only the Contact with Corbin before i got the Tix was really nice i think he is the only good guy there
Fast shipping but terrible service on return or exchange They could t even recognise when they had received a package  very strange
Once I registered I was issued with an offer code I ordered over 500 worth of lights however the code was invalid I sent 2 emails to JD Lighting nobody bothered to reply or issue a partial refund
The lights were shipped without any further correspondence
never again
On everything that I have ordered from MCM the shipping charges are way too high
Why are these people stealing that money disguised as processing fee What does that even mean Build that in the price if you really do have a fee its ridiculous
While they say their products have a lifetime warranty that does not include the cartridge in the shower unit Mine quit working after about 12 months And they cost 100 each They need to either improve their product or extend the warranty to include the cartridge
Official home of the Dior Sauvage 200ml no goods but also shows the sale which is very bad behavior the customer is irresponsible I am very disappointed with Dior

I signed up to this site for a free account seeking a place room to rent They with withheld the messages sent to me by people looking for tenants for 2 weeks Needless to say the rooms were filled before I even received the messages Waste of time Stick with Gumtree I can understand charging people to advertise their rooms but how are they going to find tenants if if your going to pull these kind of stunts with out warning Forget this site
So fast that when I discovered a mistake the customer service person wanted to triple the price to correct it The deal went thru as the dates I wanted with noon pick up and a noon drop off I wanted to increase 3 hours earlier on the pick up time This would increase the 4 days to 5 days which I understand and agree However rather than an increase of the 21 per day which was the Quote d price she told me it was going to cost 350
no tracking info no account set up moved to one of your competitors with same pricing and better service tried to post as 1 star but was not allowed
I received one email to say that 1 company was going to Quote and that they were going to get more Quote s from other companies but there was no information in the email I received a phone call about a week later and she told me she was going to get more Quote s and then I didnt hear anything No point wasting your time they are probably just selling your details to make money
We went and purchased a sectional couch had it for not even 4 months and the supports snapped and broke We tried contacting the company by email and fb them finally phone They told us they wouldnt be able to make a decision fort 30 days after waiting they told us because it was a floor model it doesnt have a warranty This is total gratis We are now stick making payments on a couch we cannot sit on Terrible customer service BUYER BEWARE
We were persuaded by a very convincing salesman at our door that Energia was the cheapest option out there and that we would save x amount on our bills every month Not only was this 100 misleading and untrue but he also convinced my elderly parents who are now seeing a big difference in their bills compared to their previous provider Energia is not cheaper and we will never ever ever use them as our provider again
I placed a review on your site to day re my inability to contact edreams  I received an e mail from trustpilot to say I had a response from edreams  GREAT at last  Unfortunately no such luck as when I try to view my reply on your page I get a big  WHOOPS  the page you are looking for could not be found  Really  Such frustration
The real culture of a company is seen of course when something goes wrong and causes you inconvenience Everybody is pretty fine in normal conditions  to please the market But only when things go wrong you can see if the company cares about its customers or just about their money KLM failed this test miserably when last week my return flight was cancelled due to a strike in Berlin airport
First it went not that bad  they found an alternative flight for me with Austrian Airlines it was a flight 1 day later than planned So far so good Its just that I couldnt afford waiting for the next day I had to come back on the right date So I decided to book a train ticket from Berlin to Amsterdam which resulted in the travel time of 65 hours instead of 15 but it was my only option And it was more expensive than the flight  by approx 70 euro 2 adults because I booked the last minute ticket
First I discovered that KLMs website is terrible when it comes to compensations You cannot even contact them by email you simply dont find how They offer Facebook Twitter but not email WHY The call was busy waiting time of 10 min it said The customer service via Facebook I used my wifes account doesnt do anything for you they just send you some weird URLs to online contact forms that you can fill and then wait for a couple of days for response I had to fill two different forms  for cancellation of the flight that they offered and then for compensation of the train ticket Intuitive and simple No thats only when you buy something from them
But my biggest surprise was to figure out that they dont want to compensate the extra cost of the train ticket approx 70 euro They now claim that it is not their fault because there was a strike and it is written in the conditions and blahblahblah So it is written in the conditions  awesome Does it make it fair I am also not guilty for that strike do I But somehow I am the only one who pays the price both in money and in extra inconvenience Me  the end customer while the company of KLM size loses nothing All the damage is offloaded on the end customer Not to mention that they will also claim compensation from the striking airport which I cannot do of course
And thats not everything The most irritating part is that my claim is much CHEAPER than what they offered me when they rebooked my flight If I would accept that offer I would claim extra hotel night  meals for two adults for the entire day Here I just claim this petty extra cost for train tickets So I am actually SAVING their money and they still do not want to be on my side
This is the most eloquent combination of a stubborn by the book handling and ridiculous inappropriate greediness of this company And for this I paid extra when I chose them instead of a lowcoster Wow never again
READ ALL THE SMALL PRINT Sometimes the price youre given may not be the price youll be paying
RETURN IS A PAIN IN THE  Paying return shipping fee is 1 thing but They charges RESTOCKING FEE
so BEWARE
I wouldnt recommend Amigo to anyone for the following reason
Recently I applied for a loan it was accepted based on the guarantor the full payout wasnt explained to me After the loan paid to the guarantor he decided not to transfer it to my account Until now I havent received the loan and Amigo refused to revoke the loan and recall it I therefore dont recommend anyone to take a loan with them unless you are willing to lose it
Was suppose to get delivery on Sunday and it still has not come
Its great when im told there is no warranty with atturo tyres They make excessive noise at low speed like the pavement is beeing ripped up I emailed their support and all they offered was to sell me new ones Nowhere on the sales page does it say they are similar to a Mud Terrain tire in terms of road noise
The items broke after the second time I wore them Very unhappy with the product Will not buy from you again
1 Manual verification for almost every order which can take up to 2448 hours if not every order ive stopped purchasing there when ive seen 2 orders in a week being marked even if ive been with them for more than 5 years
2 Not so good deals
3 Expensive for non US countries
4 Customer support seems to be dead sent in a ticket  mail related to an issue few months ago never got a reply
5 If they put an item for the wrong price you get the game revoked leaving a mark on your Steam  Origin account
I have installed the system over 4 years ago I think the filters work great but I have a problem with salt free softener portion of the system The biggest disappointment comes with how Pelican advertises the system without telling you the whole truth If you consider buying one you have to understand that this is not a water softener but rather a water conditioner The system is not removing calcium and magnesium from your water but rather changes the minerals into harmless crystals in a process called physical water treatment Pelican claims that the system is certified for 996 prevention of scale buildup Perhaps this is true when it comes to liquid state of water so it will not affect your plumbing inside of your pipes But from my experience you will see negative effects of hard water everywhere where water evaporates dishwasher tips of your faucets and showerheads toilet bowl etc If you have dishwasher you want to be sure that it has water softener built it or you will ruin your dishes and make sure that you have an extended warranty on your Keurig coffee maker  lol On a positive note the system gives you a lot of benefits over water softeners that use salt But I dont understand why Pelican does not tell you everything that you need to know to make a fully informed decision
Well I have tried making a complaint back in December I got completely ignored so I raised it with Financial Ombudsmen and guess what a complaint was logged
Only problem is I now have to wait 8 weeks which is unacceptable given if they had raised a complaint when I asked them I weeks would be up and I would have my money
I have complained to all the management team
Kristin Zuber apparently the customer care manager such a manager she blocks your email absolutely appalling behaviour this is why the PayPal team are as bad as they are only following their managers lead
But then the remaining managers CEO and MD also ignore emails
This company should be made to improve immediately
They may be selling cheap products but you pay almost the same price for the toll Without informing you before purchase
bad and wrong information for the customers
1Order delayed far beyond agreed also displaying wrong delivery time on website on items

I am writing to warn others of misleading website information and the additional fuel charges on arrival at the Golcar collection desk in Alicante
At the time of booking we selected a Vauxhall Corsa costing us less that 8 We were then invited on the Goldcar website to pay in advance for fuel which was a total 7054 and it clearly stated 0 to pay on arrival on my printout however we were made to pay again for fuel a further 5207  1901 administration fee on arrival
I was deeply annoyed by this as I thought I had saved myself some bother on arriving and owing to either a very misleading website or error I have paid twice for fuel
I have contacted customer services 3 times with neither acknowledgement or reply given
I believed Goldcar were one of the more reputable companies in Spain but I have been disgusted by how they have overcharged me and blankly refuse to reply Saw so many horrifying stories about this comany when looking to see if others had encountered similar issues
Avoid this company

The prices on the website are great and the fact that theyll contact your doctors office for you is great However their customer service doesnt know how to read a simple prescription I was told that the prescription I was ordering for myself was not the same as what my prescription said This was untrue and I tried to explain this to the representative but he was just not getting it For that reason I will be going to a more reputable site like 1800Contacts to not have the headache
Having to keep pumping it up Thought I would not have to at this price Perhaps it is just my board Diana
Im disapointed with my order the package never arrived to my home address and your customer serviice needs a lot of improvement like a phone number to reach you I trusted you to comply  but did not get anything from you at this point you have my money and my event was damaged I hope that you can at least return my money

I was under the impression that I had ordered HP ink and received a similar but generic brand which my husband had a mental attack over when he installed them colour and black and threw the extra black out
I have had a good experience in the past so was somewhat disappointed when this happened I did send an email to question why the 61 had an XL after it when the HP brand does not Was told more ink the cartridge

I had the most horrid experience from this company I made a purchase for a cazal legend frames after I made the purchase I receive several email requesting my identification I sent several emails of proof and still kept getting emails  saying my account has been flagged After several nerve wrecking phones to the company the matter was resolved I went online to check the status of my purchase and their was not evidence showing that I had actually made a purchase from this company even though the money was taken from my card I made a call to the company and was told the product was out of stock but to date the product is still available for purchase online How is that even remotely possible When I contacted the company all I got was sorry for the inconvenience How they stay is business is beyond me
Previous supplier had cheaper service and month bill what is easy to paylooks like new not always is goodI had similar experience with airtricity

At first I liked the meals however I cancelled my subscription and they sent me a package anyway Their customer service was completely unhelpful and rude It might be okay if you plan to use it every week but it is TERRIBLE FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS on a limited budget who wish to do it on a week by week basis
So I placed a bet with paddy power Spurs v millwall fa cup quarter final C Eriksen to score first spurs to win 50 10 stake at odds 601 Eriksen scored first and spurs lead 20 at halftime I logged onto my account at halftime interested to see how much the cash out figure was going to be Once I selected my open bets highlighted in green won 610 Therefore the bet was closed and no cash out figure had been Quote d Happy daysor so I thought The game finished 60 to spurs No money was credited to my account  paddy power deny any knowledge of ever updating the bet to won 610 Be careful it seems to me that they knew that they would have to offer a decent cash out figure in the second half so therefore negated my bet at halftime  a bookie being bookie took the chance of the game not finishing 50 At this time paddy power claim that in la liga champions league  premier league games if your team goes 20 at anytime they will pay you as a winning bet This does not include the fa cup I am assuming that my account was updated to won 610 in error The frustrating part is the fact that they took away my ability to cash out for the rest of the game including when spurs went 50 This option I would have consideredbut didnt have to as I had won 610 Racketeerssteer well clear
I recently ordered a lace wig Senegalese braided style The colors are great The packaging appeared okay upon arrival however the wig looks used There are many patches of unbraided roots in the lace wig including 40 of the edges Also the ends of the wig are left unbraided
This was my FIRST online hair purchase I usually go to the beauty store to see and assess the product prior to purchase Due to the ombre color I was looking for which is rarely found in the store I resulted to ordering online
I have recently bought another similar style lace wig from a beauty supply store that was in excellent new condition It was from the same Zuri beauty line
I hope to return this purchase and receive a FULL refund This wig appears as it must have been the tryon wig that got packaged and shipped out
I used to only shop on here for my eliquid because Totally Wicked had the best taste flavor options and nicotine strength options They are also very quick in their delivery time which was huge for me because I tend to order at the last minute due to not making it a priority lol so Ive really appreciated that Also like I said they had the best fullest and truest flavors I could find But the last batch of orange candy tasted way off from the original time I bought it It tasted almost like it was menthol or had something bad in it that reacted in a bad way something I have never experienced with any of the many vape shops Ive purchased from I decided to give them another try and same exact thing Plus my blueberry is doing it too Which is very upsetting because I was looking forward to those flavors and the quality of flavors I received in the past If there is something I did wrong in ordering please let me know

I paid about 750 for my order to take nearly a week to ship across Dublin city If I wanted sameday delivery this might be reasonable I ordered something else the same day from a company in Slovakia and it got here in the same time using the same courier DPD If Id used Amazon it would have been free Why
Order was not shipped timely  one item was cancelled without providing an explanation as to why it was cancelled In previous experience with Campmor no issues Guess this is the one percent of orders not shipped the next day
The employees just want you in and out when they should be doing everything they can to help you find the perfect dress Peaches has the largest dress selection around but theyre so rude and careless Its not worth it especially when youre spending around 600 on a dress If Peaches is the only store that has your dress select styles you want to try on online before you go and try to go on a weekday

I placed an order today midmorning gave them phone number and address for the delivery I asked them several times if they are sure that the person would get the flowers today I was told NO PROBLEM then today at 510 the person that was to get the flowers order knew NOTHING about them When I checked via status all it said is Driver has not updated I then called the 800 number gave my order number told them what did not happen which was no delivery of flowers and now I want my order canceled and money back I was told that they had to talk to the local person but that they were already closed and they too show no update from Driver Meaning also that it confirmed no delivery was made so give me my money back They said no we have to talk to them first it does not matter the person did not get the flowers they broke their end of the agreement By chance I order other set of flowers from another company in another town and I had no problem with them I even ordered those flower MUCH later but they still delivered the product So I will NEVER use this Avas Flowers again
I ordered a bouquet of flowers and a balloon to celebrate an employees anniversary with us I ordered same day service They called the office and asked to speak to the employee the flowers were ordered for then asked how what time the business was open until She told them we were open until 6 but shed only be there until 5 At 515 we called customer service and were told the route of delivery had to be changed to facilitate this order My employee waited for the delivery past the time she was supposed to leave because she knew they were coming They delivered the bouquet only and forgot the balloon The delivery was cold and they abruptly left We again called customer service and advised them they forgot the balloon and just to credit it back to my credit card Instead they delivered the balloon the following day Totally unsatisfied with entire experience and this companys lack of customer service Will not use again
It is not very clear when you pay the 1999 to unlock your device that they will then want you to pay another 2999 to get the unlock processed I also sent two emails asking for a regfund and have had no reply
The product was satisfactory but the delivery and follow up was very poor We had to personally pick up the product from our new home location 500 miles away and was promised a discount as well as shipping reimbursement that has not been paid Its going on 6 months with no reply from the owner
I do not think that is normal to have the same shoes for 3 years with the same price as I have seen in some of the shops Unless you are selling vintage which is not the case So you go and buy some pair of expensive shoes which are 3 years old and are being sold for the same price The normal thing to do is to discount the material you have left from other seasons instead of tricking the customer
product did not allow machine to print
I changed the toneer supplied  but still could not print
The first of my order was not delivered
I will not use a service that does not

B notify me that the order could not be delivered

Also if youre job had a price attached why are people who dont even bother reading your ad allowed to leave a message with a price way over what you can afford One ignorant goose charged 140 for a 60 job I found that infuriating

I ordered 3 boxes of contacts You charged my account and then notified me that they were not is stock Over a week later I still have not received them You would think that when an order is delayed because it is out of stock and you have already charged the buyers account you would try to do something like over nighting the order when they became available But no that would be good customer service

I purchased checks for my small business from Deluxe in 2014 In 2015 I went to electronic means of payment I contacted Deluxe and requested to be taken off their mailing list Since that time I have received endless solicitations from them for my old business and new online businesses I started Since 2014 I have contacted Customer Service no less than 10 times requesting the solicitations to stop Each time I was reassured that they would end and they simply didnt I now have solicitations going to my old addresses opening the door to identity theft When I have called Deluxe the Customer Service Agents continually try to reassure me that there is no way anyone could order checks in my name Having been a police officer I know that is highly untrue Apparently they are ignorant to the fact that it is one of the major reasons why the majority of transactions are now electronic I will never use any of this companys services again

I sent the company several emails asking to cancel my order within 24 hours of placing it I also asked for a phone number where I could reach them and instead they emailed back and told me to use their live chat However they have no live chat service on their website now they are not responding to me I believe they are waiting until after 24 hours to send me another message back at which time they will tell me I am no longer able to cancel my order However I have a record of all my emails sent to them I will pursue this further until I receive a refund and I will also contact other sources to make sure that this company gets known for its bad customer service and the lies they tell with respect to how I can contact them I have now asked them at least three times in email to cancel my order I received one message telling me they are sorry that I want to cancel my order and to let them know if I still want to cancel my order Again they are stalling on refunding me and cancelling my order I replied again and told them that yes I still do want to cancel my order I have also asked for a valid phone number for where I can reach a customer service agent but Im not sure I will ever get one This is one of the worst companies I have ever dealt with
UPDATE  now they tell me they are going to refund my money and cancel my order I will have to wait and see if the charge is reversed on my credit card for 35 business days However they STILL did not provide me with a valid phone number where I can call them to discuss my complaint and let them know why I am canceling my order This is very poor customer service when you dont provide a valid phone number for a customer to call In addition they indicate they have a LIVE chat service but they do not and now they lie about it Other customers have complained about the same thing Why tell a customer that you have a live chat service when you do not At least be honest

I clearly asked for the proper instructions or invoice or link to pay for my items at an agreed cheaper rate They never helped with this I ended up making an order at the regular rate and I hope they will refund me the difference in price I wasted 4 days of time trying to get my seller to take my money and process the order Poor communication long waits for replies and not helpful I have customers here in Canada asking for product that is now arriving late not happy

I placed an order order 100107067 on 25th January for 2 cutting blades for a printer an 80 order I contacted Digiprint via webchat a month later 24th February to find out where the order was as Id had no further contact other than order confirmation at the time of placing I was only then informed that the parts were not in stock and they would not be in receipt of them until 1st March By then we needed the parts urgently so I requested to cancel the order immediately as I would source the parts elsewhere I expressed my disappointment that they had not informed me that they did not have the stock and had not notified me poor customer service from the outset I was told via webchat that I could not cancel the order that way but had to send an email directly to digiprint to cancel the order So I wrote up an explanatory email stating the situation and requested to cancel the order The email did not go through that day or the next so I then resent it through the contact us box where eventually I received a reply

Place is a joke We were told it would be 68 weeks for our couch We called at the 8 week mark to check the order it had not been shipped yet they said they would call the manufacturer Called at the 9 week mark and we were told the manager would call us back with answers on way it was taking so long She never called us back We then called again at the 10 week mark again with no idea where the couch was They never called the manufacturer at the 8 week mark So they told us again they would call A Few days later they called and told us they would have the couch by Friday and it would be delivered on Saturday I called on Friday night because NOBODY called back to let me know my couch had arrived Couch was FINALLY delivered at 11 weeks BUT has multiple Imperfections stitching coming apart worn out spots and a nail head poking through the fabric So moral of the story is almost 3 months for a couch they assured me would be here in 68 weeks and to TOP it all off the couch that is a disaster

I ordered some flowers for a friends funeral and the address was messed up and the flowers were not delivered on the due daytime Someone from the company kept trying to call me over and over but spoke little to no English and I could not understand what they were saying or what they were asking for After three calls I stopped answering They had the number of the family member at the delivery end and could have just as easily called her A day after delivery was due I received an email from Avas asking me to call them I called and was again speaking with someone with very brokenunclear English We finally managed to get address changed to the funeral home itself but it was a struggle with lots of friction At one point I even asked for someone who spoke clearer English and I was told there was no one available  that everyone was busy
Even after giving the representative the correct funeral home address in Paducah KY  the company attempted to deliver the flowers to a different town where there werent even any funeral homes The company finally two days later called the recipient of the flowers and she had them deliver to her home in Nashville TN  a long way away from the funeral home in Paducah KY The flowers that were delivered were not the ones I ordered they were much lower quality and did not include the cross pillow that I ordered as a religious symbol for the family The cross was the most important part of the design I ordered
After writing emails with the company  explaining all of this  they refused to refund the order or credit me with any kind of discount This company has the worst customer service I have ever had to deal with
Website is hard to navigate I ended up buying the wrong part because they had the wrong picture I wanted to buy a muffler  and the picture was of a muffler but the item I ended up purchasing was a resonator Called to return the part and complained saying i made the purchase by what the picture was showing Now I HAVE TO PAY FOR THE RETURN SHIPPING OUT OF MY OWN POCKET even though it their fault
Just got a phone call saying they have no driver available in my area for the foreseeable future I had booked 24th Feb which is when my MOT is due They could only offer for me to drop my car at their garage anytime after the 28th Feb by which time my MOT would be expired
I ordered 2 items from OLDIES When they arrived one was broken I contacted customer service and was told to send a picture of the damaged item It has been almost 2 weeks and Ive heard nothing Dont waste your time Theyre just lip service
I got 90 euro bill i am single person So its still high
Paypal hold on funds after buyer had called and said all good I asked paypal do you cover me as a seller on a car transaction they first told me yes with their deceptive words you are seller eligible and after pressing further I was told there is absolutely no protection we just hold the funds The problem here is that many people lose their property especially senior citizens as a direct result of Paypal policies and lies Paypal is being sued again for misappropriation of charitable donations most of which are never seen by the intended charities I closed all my accounts and will advise the same to all the people I know Hold that paypal

Requested a specific car BMW 535 and received Quote  Upon picking up BMW I did not realize it was a smaller version 3 series BMW When I returned it the next day Business had already closed I was told they will issue the 3 series to customers if the original request was not available However I was not told this upon completing paperwork for the 5 series and the price difference did not reflect such change on my receipt As luck would have it the 5 series became available when I returned to cancel the 3 series rental However the clerk had to redo the paperwork a second time as my receipt still displayed the higher rate 5 series and not the 3 series they gave me I guess my biggest complaint came when I asked if the car could be washed to remove the leaves twigs bird droppings and such from the car The sales rep hosed the car down and said I was all set At which time I asked another clerk in the cleaning bay area where there was a vacuum and cleaning supplies if he had a towel so I could wipe the excessive water off the car so it would not streak He stood up from his sitting position put his cell phone down and reached over and handed me a towel I wiped the car down and drove on my merry way I simply assumed he would wipe the car down for me the customer and not just hand me a towel to do it myself especially after he watched the sales rep hose the car down Aside from that minor setback the car great Oh did I mention there was less than a quarter tank of gas in the car and the low gas light was on when I received it so first stop was at the gas station

I placed an order with prestige flowers being one who likes to give new companies a try I ordered Valentines flowers for my wife who works in a school and thought it woul be a nice suprise for her to receive at her workplace I later realised that she will be on half term holiday and called customer services to change the address within 24 hours of placing the order and spoke to an advisor after 45 mins of holding Simple enough you would have thought Much to my dismay not only can they not change the address but they cannot cancel and refund Will not be using such a incompetant company again Also the website doesnt display any details of the order very poor customer service
Worst Support and delivery ive ever had Ill never buy anything there
Received broken item Contacted customer service but got no response from them Contacted support nothing also Never buy from this company again

This was my first Oder experience for replacement filters The filters arrived quickly however when I opened the box I noticed the filters were not individually wrapped like I had expected 4 filters in a plastic bag
When I looked at the bag I noticed dead bugs inside I called the company they sent out replacements and emailed me a RGA FedEx shipment sheet to return the ones with the bugs
Each and every time I talked to Avas Flowers to arrange for the delivery of birthday flowers for my friend on March 6 eg Calls with Avas Flowers 2x on March 6 1 call March 7 and now 1 call on March 8 I find out they did not keep their promises from the day before
The customer service representative was so sweet though swearing on her childrens lives that my order now will be delivered Friday it was supposed to be delivered on Monday March 6th that instead of insisting on a refund I am giving them one last chance
Still waiting for my delivery how can i rate very poor prices seem very steep more like ebay not rrp
Will go elsewhere

One item was damaged they said it would send the missing part instead of a new item Im still waiting for that They could not provide a tracking code for the shipment of the missing part
I read other reviews and noted the extra charge after the initial outlay was for if your phone was still in contract period Mine was not but I still had to pay the extra 30
I ponied up as I didnt want to wait the O2 predicted wait of 1530 days Turns out that O2 unlocked my phone after only 3 days The unlock provided by this company came through a full 5 days after that
My advice  do it through your phone provider if you can be patient and save yourself the 50 that this option WILL cost you if you choose to use it
We bought tickets that were represented as row 1 on the court side and found ourselves up in the club section in the end zone as far away from the play as you can get I feel ripped off and will be taking it up with their representative
Good service much appreciated
Thanks
Did not do as advertised I purchased the software because they led me to believe it would fix a DDE error message I was getting
First when I signed up I said I only wanted one box I didnt want the subscription I went online to try to cancel the subscription Of course you couldnt cancel it online You have to fing call I called and they werent open yet It was like 8am And because Im an adult with a busy life I forgot to call back Then I have this 35 charge in my account for crap I dont want I call and tell them I want a refund bc I didnt want it and that Id send this crap back And they said they cant That is crap If you get the product back it shouldnt be an issue The candy isnt good enough to be worth 35 Dont waste your time or money
This sight seems as if it would be a good one It takes months to get your money When you log your books in and the condition you get one price and then once they get the books in hand they conveniently decide they will not buy one of the books that is in mint condition They say we will recycle the book or you can pay to have it shipped back I will definitely not use this sight again
Packaged bad

Went to install the cartridge and ended up getting ink all over my hand and printer Threw the cartridge away Buy cheap and you get cheap
currencyFair should have identified the transaction I was planning was not possible before I occured a cost
These resources are very convenient and I was very excited to try it so I used it for one free box and then cancelled right away The website took me through the steps to give feedback etc however I did not receive an email confirming this I did not know that was necessary to prove I had cancelled my subscription
Long story short all emails received hence I believed were junk mail and did not read them or look at them but apparently it was their way of confirming I was receiving another box and would be charged for it I was charged 60 without my consent and now have a box of food that will spoil as I have no fridge space I am both sincerely upset about the wasted food and the money that I no longer have to go towards paying my rent
I tried once more to cancel on the website and I never did receive a cancellation email for that So I called in to customer service believing that they would be helpful as the food industry which I spent over five years in is customer oriented I was told they could do nothing for me I had the other person whose name is on the credit card charged call in to see what she could find out She talked to three different people and apparently experienced incredibly rude behavior This is unfortunate
Confused and disheartened I looked them up on the Better Business Bureaus website they have an F rating and are unaccredited as well as have 23 unresolved claims I am disappointed in myself for not doing the research necessary before consuming a product Therefore I thought I would post to warn others Do not sign up for this because there is a large chance you will be sorely disappointed by the policies this company holds and the people who enforce them
been waiting for backorder stuff placed order 21417 and still not here
My girlfriend bought 2 return tickets from Denmark to Malaysia she was already down in Malaysia because of a trip around the world i needed to get down there and home she obviously also needed the ticket home thats why she bought 2 return tickets since they were cheaper than a 1 way trip home Because she didnt take the trip down there with them they called her a no show and cancelled her whole ticket We were told if we wanted to change the ticket to a home trip for around 5000 DKK The ticket was 3700 DKK so thats a total price of 8700DKK Over 1000USD for a home ticket Never have i had this bad of a service Unless we get compensated we will NEVER travel with them again
I have waited for 6 months for a livingroom set from gardner white It would take one hell of a space for me to comment on the entire event of crap But after the 4th PROMISED day of getting my couch I told them to pick up there crap and Im going somewhere else Gardner White waterford has the worst customer service EVER I have never had this sort of horrible experience So hey gardner white Steve Tronstein and Rachel Tronstein if you dont care about your company or how a business should be run or keeping customers then by all means do nothing about this and truly you will succeed at being the worst company in history I will for sure be telling EVERYONE what lousy service I recieved and ill be spending my money somewhere else
Ugh where do I start Me and my fianc ordered furniture at the San Angelo location back in December We bought a bedroom set and our sales guy was super awesome We live in Dallas just visiting in San Angelo so we had our furniture sent to the Lewisville location We scheduled a delivery date for 020117 About a week before we decided to go up to the store to look at a dining room table Home Zone had no record of our delivery date nor our furniture Luckily we had our receipts so they honored that However they did not have that date available for delivery so told us we had to pick it up at the Euless location Which was about an hour from us I WAS SO OUTRAGED The customer service sucked and the entire business is so unorganized On they day of pickup we called in the morning and they told us the truck would be there that afternoon but they could not confirm if our furniture would be on the truck or not Are you kidding me The sales rep said she would call us around 2 Five oclock comes around still no call So my fianc calls and they said our furniture was there but forgot to call us So we had to haul across town in the middle of traffic It was a nightmare Once we got it home it was difficult to set up The furniture is nice but I can tel the quality sucks
Dont buy from Homezone Go somewhere else
I have ordered 2 pair of glasses through this webshop and both times they have been delayed in customs Today I called DHL and asked why and they told me that this webshop states way too low values on their packages something that at least Norwegian customs have found out and results in major delay because of customs being forced to open the packages track down the products online to find correct value
So please stop cheating on your values so that we can receive our purchases in time
We arrived at liverpool airport to pick the car up only to be told our car had been given to someone else Apparently we were supposed to collect it earlier which would have been impossible as we hadnt even left Jersey So we then had to pay another 160 for another car as we were told no similar cars were available We were also charged another 40 quid for a child seat even though we had already paid for it The guy wasnt interested it was ten pm at night When we went to collect the car we walked past loads of cars we could have har instead Total rip off and not want you want arriving late to an airport with an already tired 3 year old Never again

I paid for unlock my iPhone then they failed unlocking it many emails with the support team and they refuse to refund my money
If you have been scammed just chargeback your money as it will be the only solution to refund your money back
I booked an appointment on the website using the voucher code for new customers I received an email confirming the booking and the price but then I have been told that the offer is not valid for the service chosen so I have to pay full price Disappointed

Unclear that they charge every month for VIP Cost me 150 before I realized they had been charging my account
I made a purchase on Gift Card Granny with my Capital One credit card and now get fraud charges I had to change my credit card and think the sites are not trustworthy
Sorry for my bad English Im not a native speaker Please be more kind to your regular customers rather than new customers or some other customers who are no longer buying games in your site I feel disappointed when I found out that you guys only sent discount code to those who didnt buy anything these days just determine to get their attention back Did you guys do this just want to show that the regular customers mean nothing to you at all
This was the worst online shopping experience Ive had I was given a gift certificate to shopuse toward vip membership but I dont see how to apply BOTH Vip promotions and the credit in one order Many selections were sold out it was not easy to update to something that was available from the cart As far as I can tell I should still have my 100 credit I hope to not report to my mother in law that this cool gift was a waste
I booked to be picked up at Mexico City airport of February arrival I received a text message stated that my driver is waiting for me with a designation while I was at Baggage Collection
I got out of the airport and cannot find my driver rang the number given and the office is closed Walked around with heavy cases for 30 minutes around the airport and scanned all the faces and named cardboard My driver was not there
I then went to the Information booth the concierge rang the number printed on my text message 3 times We then gave up and ordered a local taxi to take me to my hotel
Next day I emailed and rang the number listed on text message on listed on the website They did not bother to answer or acknowledge my email
So I did not get my refund or speak to them to highlight my concern So people DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY
Be warn

If you are renting part of a month at the beginning and part of a month at the end they still charge you for two whole months This company does not prorate their bills so you will actually pay more than you should
I ordered bathers on boxing day and received my parcel on the 20th of March I has originally entered the wrong address so not Zodees fault then with many emails it was sent to the wrong address once again then back to Zodee who then denied knowledge of the new address then was eventually sent to my address again Now i have beautiful bathers and Summer is over Ill never purchase here again
Just go directly through car rental company Do not use this third party site Most of what you pays does not even got to the car rental company
first impression was good but little disappointed
My rebate had not applied after 2 months and submitting multiple times and calling to see if my rebate had been receivedI was informed to just wait and I dont know what else to tell youWhen asked to speak to a supervisorI was placed on hold so long I hang up Terrible customer service
They never send delivery on time most of the items are unavailable I ordered some groceries 2weeks back It didnt come in time The guy called and said they will deliver next day I told them many times that they need to come after 5 pm as I work whole day But he came at 1 and put the bags outside I came home at 5 and shocked to see the groceries There were frozen items it in They all were of course went straight to bin Really disappointed with the service
You guys are loosing good opportunity of delivering Indian groceries
Stranded in France the day after Christmas when the plane ticket I had bought with Lastminute wasnt recognized by the airline Iberia told me they had no record of me if I could just f off and calling Lastminute they said they couldnt do anything it was the airlines problem
Well it was only my problem when I had to pay 200 to buy another plane ticket home
Lastminute never even paid back the money i had paid for a ticket they didnt deliver
Such a joke of a company
I ordered the towels and got a crib sheet When I contacted support I was told there are no exchanges or replacements just refunds I just wanted the towel
This company has let thousands of people down and they do not care as long as they get your money They say they delivered something on the date requested when they did not
They will switch out roses with the cheaper flowers They will not give you deluxe flowers but you WILL PAY so think twice before you click on that button My flowers were not what I ordered for my children
I ordered 2 large cakes and when they were delivered they left them on the front porch No knock or door bell to make sure someone was home to receive them They could of been delivered hours before they were found The safest part was if they had knocked there was someone there I didnt spend 40 in delivery fees for them to be left on the porch to get bugs in them or turn bad in the weather Really not happy with the service on that end Too much money to spend for the recipitant not to be able to enjoy it
If you live in the Highlands be aware the postage goes from 499 to 999  if goods are unsuitable you can send back by Royal Mail at whatever charge depending on weight etc or by Collect For 449 I think this is scandalous to be charged to return goods I wont be ordering from Uttings again which is a shame as the product was great quality The only reason I was returning was because they were too big
So painful to order and then get canceled via formemail I wonder why I am even spending time to give them the poor rating they deserve
i changed the drop off location by phone to realise afterwards they changed the pick up and drop off time when i called back another operator told me she should make a new booking which was gonna cost me more than 50eur more

I have had a personal paypal account for more than 10 years and could not have been a happier customer I lived overseas in the Philippines for 6 years and worked with US clients and paypal was absolutely my best friend in business When I started a web company  I relied on that same friend  paypal It took me over a year to develop my website but I still tried to sell products on it while the site was still a work in progress Amazingly I had a few sales  which paypal processed My business is now in full swing I sell a high end product and as much as 40 of my well heeled customers use the American express card For the past 60 hours  my site cannot accept the Amex card Paypal has no reason why they cant figure out why the card wont process they wont credit my monthly fee to me and they can only state  we are doing our best Soif you want the possibility of your business to not be able to take a payment for more than 2 days with no explanation or reason why  and with no end in sight  then PayPal is the company for you
My Granddaughter went on her first holiday She had no hot water no heating and no linen on the bed It was like this for three days and it was March so very cold Bookingcom wont do anything The internet was very poor and no phone signal
Will never use them again Not what I call customer service
Extremely poor customer support My transaction has never completed for which they has updated in the system saying its completed
They have Stopped replying my e mail as well Its my routine not to call them every morning and as expected getting the same answer everytime
No result
They are just not good Never do business with transfast
Did not receive this order never got a tracking number not even an email with the order
My order never really got placed even though it did on my end A manager said he couldnt send it because some of the order was no longer available because no one caught the issue at hand So he canceled the order  I had to find new items but the items I wanted were really the best ones that I lost because no one addressed the issue when it 1st happened Then I had to call a manager back again my account never got credited Being flustered  frustrated my mistake I put the wrong shipping address when I placed the 2nd order I called a manager again immediately  he reassured me it would be shipped to the correct addressNOPE I was going to call back again  complain but I just didnt want to have to deal with it so I paid to ship the order to my mom myself The reason that I gave it a 2 star is because even though I had a very rough experience the product is a good buy
Contacted Physio Room to buy a knee brace I described my condition exactly as knee Specialist instructions They told me they cant give any advice as to which knee brace I should purchaseRidiculous Then suggested I contact their PhysiotherapistI did He cannot even be bothered to reply to my emailThis company is a complete waste of timeNo customer care no knowledgeand are totally incompentent to do any business with I do not know how they stay in business Futhermore it is very expensive to telephone them 0844 number up to 40 pence per minuteThat must be how they make moneyThey cant make much it selling knee braces

We have reserved a Ford Fiesta for a trip to Maui Its the least expensive hatchback which we need for transporting a surfboard The reservation allows for a Ford Fiesta OR SIMILAR however cannot guarantee that it be a hatchback Its 6 months before the trip so it seems a note should be included to make sure the car is a hatchback Instead Ive had to spend time arguing the point with CarRental8 Why
My husband and his friends booked a trip with Tripsta from Copenhagen to Mnchen for Oktoberfest 2017 The trip is with an SAS flight from CPH and a return flight with Transavia A couple of months ago Transavia oh do not even get me started on their non existing customer care contacted us explaining that they have changed the return flight for the day before If tis was not suitable for them Transavia would refund the tickets Great we asked for a refund because they wanted to stay that extra day
So now when we ask Transavia where the money is they tell us that they refunded the amount ca DKK 2500 to Tripsta weeks ago Of course we cannot get trough to Tripstas customer care because it does not exist so no money no tickets and a bitter taste that we should have been much better at checking the reviews here because then we NEVER would have chosen a booking agent with a reputation like this
Stealing is a crime last time I checked
I have tried contacting Ticketbis 3 times through their online chat form and not received a response I will not receive my tickets on time since we will be traveling in early May and our event is in late May I called Stubhub to get some help and the agent really tried to get information for me She was going to bring it to senior managements attention that I was not getting a response
I just want to make better arrangements for my ticket delivery receiving them by the end of April
Since Ticketbis management seems to monitor this website I would really like some help
We were there on early Friday afternoon to pick out a new mattress The salesman left us to assist another couple at the same time The mattress couldnt be delivered until Monday When the mattress arrived it was a queen instead of a king The attitude of the office employees was simply oh well mistakes happen and they would deliver a king on Tuesday The delivery guys were okay They would not even give us a time when the mattress would be delivered on Tuesday Apparently they dont realize most people have jobs during the week
This monitor has terribly ghosting problem It appears on all video games especially on sports games  you can always see a ghost shadow behind each running athlete on a green lawn Its a hardware defect and you have no way to fix it through configuration I have another cheap monitor under 60 But its gaming experience is much better than this one  and you call it a gaming monitor
I called the BenQ customer service waited for 70 minutes and nobody answered it On their menu they dont even have a basic sorting like tech support or bill service individual or business customers Its ALL IN ONE Honestly this is the most inefficient and unfriendly customer service Ive ever seen I am so disappointed
I ordered the dog tags with Serve with Spirit on them As soon as the kids touched them at the year end party they printsticker on the front started to peel off into several pieces The kids were very upset and disappointed by this award I sent an email with a picture of the product to the company on 18th and nobody has bothered to make resolution My customer number is 750090004 and order number was 17005184
I would appreciate anything that can be done to replace these items
Thanks Michele
Ridiculous overpriced items Will not respond to email if you want to cancel I emailed minutes after I submitted to cancel but no response until order had already been shipped
the website said to call in to get a lower price but they were quoting higher prices Had to come back to the website to book it
its key issue is that some users have such a weighted reply they tak priority and can negate numerous low rated users I used to use wot all the time but now use scam adviser and google safe browsing instead
Absolutely horrible experience if I could give zero stars I would Will never order from diorcom again They mistakenly sent me another customers order instead of my actual order I called to report the issue and they sent me a return label When I called to follow up I was told that they were waiting for my product to be returned by the person who received it by mistake They explained that they had to credit the payment to the wrong parties first before being able to ship the correct package It had now been 3 weeks since I placed my order and 2 weeks after my estimated arrival date I had to spend 45 minutes on the phone with multiple customer service agents before I was told that they would ship me my actual product and I had to request that they expedite the shipping so that I wouldnt have to wait any longer No apology ever no attempt to make up for what was their mistake All agents were either clueless or rude While understandable that mistakes can happen it is unacceptable to not make any attempt to correct the mistakes made or apologize to the customer Will never use this website again
I contacted lastminutecom due to me not being able to stay at a hotel due to the family emergency of my fatherinlaw falling terminally ill
I initially spoke to the hotel direct who agreed they would accept an amended booking date due to the circumstances however I would have contact lastminutecom first because booking was through lastminutecom
I spoke with the team on 150317 at around 2000 and was informed that this amendment would be no issue providing the hotel agreed the amendment I was also told that this would be resolved within a matter of minutes
On 160317 at around 2000 I received an email stating that the amendment had been rejected I promptly telephoned the hotel who informed me that Lastminutecom had only contacted the hotel circa 20 minutes prior to receipt of my email Nearly 24 hours after my initial phone call
The hotel advised that had lastminutecom contacted them when I had initially called the amendment would not have been rejected
This was obviously a time sensitive situation as the hotel stay was 160317 and the staff lied to me by stating they would resolve my situation within a matter of minutes
I then called the team again 160317 at around 2100 and was told by customer care management that he would personally resolve the issue by calling the hotel within the hour to corroborate my story and call me back to discuss
Over 24 hours have passed since that phone conversation and I have yet to hear back from lastminutecom
This is the second time I had spoken to the customer care team and on both occasions I have been told that the team would contact the hotel and resolve this situation however on both occasions I have been lied to This situation has neither been resolved nor it appears has the lastminutecom team undertaken any of the works that were promised to me as a paying customer
On top of that I find it utterly disgusting and offensive that lastminutecom would dare Quote policy at me during a time of bereavement especially when I have already undertaken a verbal agreement that the booking would be amended and the situation be resolved irrelevant of policy
This situation is NOT about the money but about being lied to and treated with absolutely no sympathy or decorum
Changed from a 2002 Mitsubishi Spacestar to a 2007 Mazda 2  no change in policy price However if I was to reverse the change that day I would be charged 82 Why do I not get a refund on the policy difference
When I enter the exact same details online for a new Quote  the new Quote is over 100 cheaper
I cant help but feel ripped off
Ordered on the 30th of January Its been 28 days and my white Cobain glasses are nowhere to be seen no pun intended Ive been reading some of the reviews on here and I guess they deliver on time if you live in America but if you live in Europe then definitely avoid You may as well put 30 in a paper shredder cause youll get the same result
I was informed by them that my airline had changed my flight schedule and route and that if this did not suit my plans I should contact Tripsta within one day for a refund I both tried to phone no answer and email 3 times and no reply Still no reply days later I have since read a lot of bad reviews about them I will be contacting my bank Skyscanner and legal authorities about this if I cannot get some response very soon
STAY AWAY FROM PIXELS LOGO DESIGN THEY ARE FRAUD
NOT IN THE US
I called Pixels logo design O6292017 to design a logo and website I paid 99900 for
Web Custom Package
99900
100 Satisfaction Guaranteed
100 Money back
I have only received a logo that only cost 20000 I purchased this package from Lisa Patrick on 712016 Lisa was nice up until I made the payment and then she vanished only to pop back up when she felt her job was in jepordyAftyer about 15 gruling days I recived my logo and my stock business card template The next step was the website I then sent Pixels everything that they requestd to get strted and this is where the nightmare begunAfter hundreds of emailssoeaking with over 10 different mangers I have yet to recive my Website I had to spend an additional 77500 which another Company that designed my now opertable website
I experienced hell with Pixels I called everydayallday only to be hung up on lied to and promised that I will receive something in regards to the look and design of the site On numerous occasions I asked for them to refund my money but I have only received a the money has been refunded reply which is not true This CompanyPixelslogodesigncom is literally taking consumers money and in exchange giving them absolutely nothing in return I am 9 months pregnant and I have been hospitalized twice dealing with this stressful situation Just recently I was suppose to speak with a Supervisor by the name of Jason W to no avail  I believe that Lisa P the women who swiped my card for the initial 99999 is the ring leader Her role I believe is to trick consumers into believing that they are based in the US Lisa speaks perfect English and assures you that your project will run smoothly and efficiently because she will be there every step of the way
Please see the attached
1 Receipt for 99900 purchase made on 712016
2 Screen shot of Pixels Logo Design stating that they have refunded back the charge
Please note that I have over 100 email exchanges I also have proof that the money was never refunded back into my account
The fruitcake was dry and fell apart when cut The fruit tasted old and had a moldy smell The double chocolate cashew and pecans The nuts were to small to have that much choclatenon them Pecans were not plump and looked old The only decent one of my order was the cocoanut but they were not soft I am very disappointed and will not recommend birchland to anyone or fugi And I will never order again Order came on 2217 Barbara mckelvey
Its terrible that that gas and elec bills are not timed the samevery inconvenient when in a rental house share and having to collect the different amountsits actually the worst customer experience I have been dealt in a very very long time I would consider moving suppliers over this
We bought a flight ticket from Bangkok to Phuket and back whit Bravoflyse Got a good price including 2 cases in the price All got confirmed whit a mail only in Swedish
Thought it could be some difficulties with that if it would be any problems
I mean I can read Swedish but wery few in the rest of the world
Of course it got troubles We got a mail from Bravoflyse saying that the luggage wasnt included in the price They also had a solution for the problem written in Swedish They also claimed that it is a system failure well I have heard that story before
Will be fun to see the Thai airport staff read Swedish This means probably that the solution will end up in our wallet
Tried to get in contact with their customers service whitout any results
So next time you are making a booking put a little more money on that and it will avoid problems and Bravoflyse

I ordered a phone case on Feb 24 and paid for the expedited shipping and extra 11 dollars and still have yet to receive my order It is now March 5 and nothing no way to track my package and no way to get a hold of them Ive sent an email and no response it is very irritating Not happy with my experience
Im a longterm user of bookingcom and have always been fairly happy with them Until last week when I encountered a problem
I had booked an entire house on Big Corn Island by the name of Brokis Place Since there was one negative review in which someone had written that his reservation had not been respected I decided to give them a call a few days before departure to double check if my reservation was indeed confirmed
I ended up speaking to a rude man who told me that the house wasnt available on those dates and that was it
No discussion possible about my confirmed booking
I then wrote to bookingcom to complain about these people and their apparent scam
ONE week after my complaint I received an email from booking customer service to tell me that indeed the house was not available but good news for me they had found me a great alternative and if I would book their alternative the price of my booking would remain he same
Upon checking their suggested alternative it turned out to be a doubletwin room without even a private bathroom and the price would be 90 Dollars less I sent them another email asking a whole bunch of questions but they just ignored all of them cancelled my booking at Brokis Place and that seemed to be the end of it
Heres their reply
We apologize that our alternative did not meet your requirements
Your original reservation will be cancelled at no charge to you and you will receive an email confirming the cancellation shortly
On behalf of the accommodation we apologise for the inconvenience caused
If we can be of any further assistance to you please feel free to contact us
Thank you again for choosing Bookingcom We hope to be your choice for future online reservations
Dont book a holiday at Brokis Place and make sure everything runs smoothly with bookingcom If not they wont have your back
Our iternary was well reseached and planned by our friend for group of 1618 people All the places we went to were amazing and worth experiencing with your own eyes
Somehow Goway Representative Kathrine didnt impress us much as we being vegetarian all the excursions book through Goway had no knowledge our dietary restrictions None of the hotels Knew that we are the group same none of the excursions knew we are group so we all have to confirm seperately We could have taken later flights if we knew hotels check in time is 3 pm and we arrived at the hotel at 1000 am and had to leave 500 am that morning to be at the destination by 10 am and hotel not available upon arrival Really poor planning on her part
Food choices not confirmed 6 people
Hotel not under group reservation 16 people
Flights not coordinated 16 people
I think Katherine has no experience in group reservations or looking into clients best interest
Just not happy with Goways Australia and New zealand Specialist

This is the second time bought something And it doesnt work
I am disappointed in my response from WholeLatteLove when I contacted them about a bean hopper empty notification light not working when the machine is out of beans It has not worked since I bought it
The last reply was The motor is still rotating slowly enough that the machine thinks that there are beans in the grinder There are no adjustments that can be made to make this work more accurately
And that was it Am I to just accept that it is not working I just bought it
People are to try only to sell costly frames not to give satisfaction of customer
I ordered J Vernon McGees volume 1 Genesis thru Deuteronomy The book I received was JVMs volume 4 Matthew thru Romans
If you are a pay as you go customer you are treated as a second class citizen and can only get hold of help via webchat Even if you prove that you did not use up Data they will still charge you for it As per usual the people of Ireland getting shafted this doesnt happen with Vodafone UK and when it did they were fined

We rented a car from them and the customer service is really bad They charge you for fuel by mistake even if you have rented ful to full They deliver the car with the tank not full and you will not get the money back for missing fuel They get angry if you dont want to pay for ensurance My advice Find another company I got the money back for the extra charge of the fuel but not for the missing fuel
I paid for a George foreman in December in Athlone it was February before I got it  I paid for a red ninja juicer after waiting 2 weeks for it when I brought it home it was a silver one they gave me I had torn the box which meant I coudnt bring it back 
At first I was unable to upgrade either systems I was finally able to upgrade 1 system using the information supplied  I went to upgrade the 2nd system a week later This was a failure following the instructions provided by Gamecheap I have tried contacting Gamecheap however they continue to not respond As of now I wasted the money for one of the upgrades If you chose to deal with Gamecheap be sure to upgrade immediately if you delay any they will not respond to help resolve any problems They refuse to communicate with you I feel they are a waste of time and money The only recourse is arbitration with your credit card company I have been cheated out of the price for one upgrade

We have still not received ink after 2 weeks Tried calling but rings out no one answers
Hello I am not going to tell you the whole story because it would take pages
1 Arrived at the hotel after an 8 hour motorcycle ride It was 435 EST So I did not receive the calls or emails
2 Clerk says that the reservations where cancelled and gave me a number to call in Atlanta GA I called the number they close at 430
3 Got on their computer and saw an email that said go to the Holiday Inn resort The clerk acknowledge that all the people were going there
4 It takes about 45 minutes to get there Due to the motorcycle event
5 We get there and they have no rooms They call another Holiday Inn even further And they are holding two rooms and we had twenty minutes to get there
6 We make it But had to pay again at a higher rate
7 We ended up paying you Holiday Inn and are now 10 miles from the event That we wanted to be able to walk to because of the traffic
After selecting a product from their Same Day delivery they delivered it after 48 hours And when inquired simply answered there was an issue at our end

I travel all over the world and have booked with various websites including bookingcom I find they advertise a price but when you go to confirm the price is completely different I have spoken to customer service on several occasions and find them extremely rude and ignorant A rude woman called Sylvia was so rude she would not let me speak She called me stupid and incapable in so many words would not let me speak and then cut me off I did tell her I am disabled and she laughed then hung up when I asked to speak to a manager STAY AWAY AND VOOK WITH OTHER COMPANY
1st time customer and 1st time ever complaining about a company online Bought a build kit from their website Tried cancelling the order when it was still being processed Was sent a return slip instead of it being cancelled Asked them why this was Hours after trying to cancel it was just told that it was now in process of being dispatched and they couldnt do anything about it As such stuck with border fees and would have to pay more than half the cost of the kit just to return it To make matters worse about half the parts in the kit were wrong not what was listed in the kit to begin with

I have been dealing with Build Direct since last summer about my floors that are milled improperly and delaminating They sent an inspector out and determined that the floor was milled improperly and thats why the floor was squeaking and the delaminating of the floor was obvious The salesman from Build Direct asked what I thought would be fair and I told him I would get back to him I emailed him a week later and I apologized for taking so long to get back but I was waiting back from an installer to figure out how much it would cost to tear out the existing floor and install the new one At that point the salesman told me that they wouldnt pay for the labor and that it was standard for them to only cover the cost of the floor If that was standard then why did they ask what I thought was fair Were they hoping I would ask for less than the cost of the floor I then talked to the inspector and the owner of the inspection company and they both said that the flooring company typically pays for the labor and flooring and they werent sure why Build Direct was arguing with me I then talked to the sales manager and told him what the inspector said He then called the inspector and then called me back and said that the inspector told him something totally different So I called the inspector back and he said that the sales manager wasnt being truthful and that he didnt want to deal with Build Direct and he was frustrated with the situation they were trying to put him in A few months ago I told the salesman from Build Direct to just sent the check for the floor and I would take them to court for the rest and let the court decide who was responsible for the labor costs Since then the salesperson has completely disappeared I called the sales manager and I received an email saying this
We are currently in the process of considering your latest correspondence and someone from BuildDirect will be back in touch with you shortly
That was on March 7th I left a voicemail with him on the third I emailed him again on the 17th to see where they were at with this and I still havent heard anything and its March 22
In my email to him I told him that the corners that are delaminating are sharp and my 4 year old daughters sock was caught and ripped by the sharp edge I have then tried to use duct tape to tape down all of the corners that are delaminating because they are sharp enough to cut a bare foot
This has been an extremely frustrating experience and the people from Build Direct have done nothing but try to point fingers to distract from the actual problems and deny responsibility
I think it says a lot when the inspection company that was hired by Build Direct has recommended to me to take Build Direct to court and they would be happy to help me
2x missed delivery Many other choices for a courier than this one Drivers do not want to drive to portage from Winnipeg I suspect although they say they have too many items to deliver in a day
I have had much better service from FedEx
My order got lost in the mail and the mail and free shipping didnt come with insurance so my daughter never got her contacts and Im out the money I paid Was basically told too bad The post office stated it was delivered to a parcel box but after confirming with the postal service supervisor there is no parcel box for my home so they were NOT delivered My mail lady stated they were searching for the lost package There are no keys that they drop off Thats not something they do They ONLY deliver to front doors
They misjudged the customers address The package was lost several days for this reason I am not at all pleased with wiggle
Still waiting fir shipping quite after 6 days
Horrible company Messed up my whole order The items i shipped back one returned damaged Expect me to be liable Make a ups claim So unhappy with this company Why would i damage the item and then return it Makes no sense Also in the first place they sent me the wrong item
I used the website to sign up so that I could have the online deal that was offered at a great price
I went through every step making many calls to get mrpn and grpn numbers filled in all information correctly using Chrome with no adblockers and all cookies enabled
When I completed filling in the last page I was redirected to a new page that said  Thank you for choosing to switch to Energia
I thought Perfect Ive signed up now I can go and do other tasks
During the signup process I read that I would be sent a new customer package with information about my account etc A month after signing up I didnt receive this and I was wondering when my first bill would arrive so I called energia who had no record of my account
I tried to sign up online again and was sent to the same page that said thank you for choosing Energia and called customer support again  no record of my application Customer support got me set up with an account at that time
The previous tenants in my house had a redirect for all post to their new address for a month so I was not receiving any of the warnings from the previous electricity and gas suppliers addressed to the householder and it turned out that I was within days of having my heat and electricity shut off in the middle of winter with two very young children
I still havent received that new customer package in the post
I cannot recommend Energia people may think they have signed up and one day find themselves with their gas and electricity cut off

The entire experience of purchasing a game from this website felt awful I was required to provide an address even though I was not receiving physical goods and required to provide my phone number The game code I received worked fine but I am intensely worried that giving this site so much personal information was a mistake
Most of my family and friends with its for woman they went from very cheap to very expensive fast
Completely different from what is showed online poor quality terrible colors cheap appereance Total dishonesty
When I saw the rental agency we were assigned I checked its ratings They were at the worst I have ever seen 644 reviews 1 12 stars I read several reviews Problems included dead batteries bugs odors filth poor mechanical condition with breakdowns and no assistance AND many false damage charges that could not get reversed We canceled our reservation
I ordered a box of 72 batteries and the deciding factor was that the description said the expiration date was 2024 When I got the batteries the expiration date was actually 2021 Three years is a huge difference when buying that many batteries Now Im trying to think of ways to use them up Not happy
I have purchased from you for few years now Unfortunately since my renewal this year for my home and office Ive never had this many problems Issues with licensing reps not being able to understand my situation as well as downloading issues 
Unfortunately Ive paid and will try to go for a refund But I will most likely look elsewhere next time
IT did not work If there is something I have to switch ither on the TV or internaly on my computer I hav e had to disconect and go back to my old cable not saying its your cable it is probably my fault

The Intoxalock rep who contacted me Jay was misleading regarding the details of my agreement At the beginning of the call he asked how long I anticipated needing the system I told him that I was working with my lawyer to have my suspension lifted early so I would need the system for anywhere between one and eleven months 11 months being the full suspension term Then at the end of the call when he was reviewing the details he said I was set up for a 12 month lease which I questioned and reminded him that I may not need it that long He then replied well you would be the first person ever to have a suspension shortened implying that he hear what I said but set me up for 12 months anyway based upon his opinion of how my case would be resolved He also mentioned that there would be a potential 50 fee for missing or being late for a calibration appointment and later I took it upon myself to ask about the initial installation appointment which he then said was also subject to the 50 fee However this was not disclosed on the front end and when setting the initial appointment he just said well they open at 8am so you can bring it in the night before or after 8am without telling me it was a firm apt time Very unprofessional
The site is very confusing and not at all user friendly Its shocking as its advertised as something for  girlfriends  Im hoping the quality of the clothes are not as poor and unpleasant as ordering them
I looked online for coilover sleeves for my car Bought them at a price of 302 I even called to place the order and to make sure that it would in fact fit my car guy said yes and by the time I went to install them They wouldnt fit I doubled check with them and they said it would Now having it being used There aint no refund you guys gotta be careful
Having no end of trouble with this company Paid for customs insurance and Light in the Box finally accepted and agreed to a refund if I made a request through PayPal I have had 4 requests now rejected and made numerous attempts to contact there Customer Service they have failed a response now in over a week let alone 24 hrs like they say
Very unprofessional to say the least so I would encourage you to stay well clear very disappointing as I thought we were getting somewhere only to be kicked down again as they even have the audacity to label the ticket as resolved and it most certainly is not
Ticket number 14739733 just in case you grow a conscience
Please stop your activities What is your added value 
They cancelled my order for no reason Im completely turned off by Dior
even tho it was my card that was having problems Every Time I changed page my shopping cart would EMPTY I Spent 5 HOURS trying to place an ORDER The lab top version of this site is BEYOND FRUSTRATING If it wasnt for the price of these products we would take our business else where

I ordered more than five pairs of shoes and after 2 weeks I emailed to see why I had only received one pair of shoes I got an email saying they had oversold their stock and no longer had what I purchased and the rest of my order had been canceled This has never happened to me before and I decided not to spend one more minute of my time pursuing it I will never purchase from Chinese laundry again
Horrible We have been waiting for over 15hrsto pick up a car It is 115am We waited for a shuttle for 30min and the line in the car rental place is not moving
I bought 2 items
I couldnt use the pure Reward points
I waited very long time for support and i didnt get answers at all
Live chat doesnt work almost all the time
Rental Cars always offer an excellent range of cars and companiesI usually pick up my hire car at Pearson Airport Toronto and make sure the hire company is in the terminal building Its an easy pickup and dropoff and if your fuel arrangement is full to full there are ample filling stations very close to the airport
Setting up the company and business was quick and easy I signed up for domain name as well Unable to configure email even after using the email FAQs No contact number Sent an enquiry Never heard back Still cannot configure my emails
I paid for two day expedited shipping because I needed my dress for the Saturday event and it did not show up on time I placed the order on a Wednesday it shipped on Thursday morning but did not arrive until Monday afternoon My event was over Just go with the free shipping And save your money They refused to refund my money or offer any coupon for my next purchase Not very good customer service

Looking through the site to find outfits to purchase with VIP credits is incredibly frustrating because so many items are out of sizing or sold out altogether It took so much more of my time to click through every outfit I was interested in just to see if it was available or not If a pant or top is sold out in your size then you should be able to substitute it for a comparable style to complete the outfit I used to love shopping on Fabletics but unfortunately the experience has become more frustrating than enjoyable
This review is based on my recent rental car experience at Tenerife South Airport and subsequent issues since returning home to UK On arrival I waited over one hour to collect a pre reserved car where a totally overwhelmed inexperienced person attempted to deal with one client as the queue lengthened Then another Goldstar employee appeared and I was told to walk up a steep incline with my luggage to another Goldcar office on a car park where three persons were just sitting awaiting clients
Now 29 days since returning the vehicle with a full tank the 81 Euros fuel deposit has not been reimbursed There is no UK number to contact and complain about this poor treatment
Horrible still havent unlocked my iphone a cheap 10 dollar unlock on ebay was better for my samsung I should have just went to a store nearby I thought an online service like this would be quick Not worth it
I have used Ozforex previously and have been satisfied with the service This time however I wanted to transfer Singapore dollars to NZ When I completed the deal the bank of deposit for the S was in New Zealand instead of the usual DBS in Singapore I called up and was told that this was because of temporary problems with the account and was informed that any fees incurred would be paid by Ozforex I transferred the money stating to my bank that fees would be covered by the payee however there was a still a S30 charge for transferring the funds to a foreign account When I forwarded this information to Ozforex I was told that these bank charges were to my account and would not be covered
I will therefore no longer use Ozforex for the transfer of S until I receive confirmation that your situation with DBS or another Singapore bank has been resolved
Each rule has exceptionthere is noone to talk to

I would have given the 0 stars but it wouldnt allowed me to Ordered item 2 weeks before Christmas and finally received item on the 28th December I had to email them to chase order as nobody answers the bloody phone Will never use again Thankfully reordered the same item with a different website on the 22nd December and received it by 24th Thankfully this saved a lot of disappointment on Christmas Day
i ordered my shirt more than 8 weeks ago never get it and takes forever to get my refund too 
It is very tricky to get on and off whilst alone The major issue for me is how sharp all of the edges are cutting into skin under and around shoulders it needs some form of cushioned edge to the straps
I cannot recommend this company to anyone
I ordered xiaomi mijia pen refills 3 x boxes of 3 on Jan 16 2 months have passed nothing
I have ordered many many times from China and this is the 2nd time that an item has somehow not shown up
Unfortunately I only read the reviews on here after placing the order and giving them my money
Still cant print from my browser They did not solve the problem and charged me 27 I want a refund 
Further more I resent being asked for a 15 TIP That is very bad style

End Nov16 Flizzr issued a claim for scratched and reimbursement of 950 as the insurance excess more than 45 days later some days before I had removed the video
I objected that my wife myself and Flizzrs girl did not see the scratches Flizzr responded that it was found after a more detailed check
Besides I dont understand why the claim was not issued immediately after the return  No answerjustification on it from the Company
For the above reasons I am skeptical about the Flizzrs behaviour and find unfit its Customer relationship

I wil never used this delivery service with lifestyle sports again I was charged 20 for a pair of football gloves when they arrived they were priced at 16
I have ordered from Thrift Books multiple times and have always been pleased with my orders Books arrive in the condition noted when selling and many times are even better than noted
They arrive within the time stated but most of the time earlier
One of the best things about Thrift Books is they sell there books at a more than reasonable price
It is one of the best companies to work with online
Cancellation even within 5 minutes will cost you 40 euros and the creditcardfee Although they have zero costs No service  no clients

I arrived in in Queenstown after a long day of travelling with my mother and 9 month old son We ordered a baby seat from Redspot At the checkin desk at the airport we were handed the baby seat and told to fit it to the car ourselves We then walked to the car park some distance away with our trolley of luggage pram porta cot and now baby seat only to find the car seat was already in there Now we were stuck with a second seat we had to take all the way back to the terminal I had a very tired little boy who was hungry and crying I then had to juggle my baby while reading instructions on how to fit a car seat in New Zealand while my mother went to find help and return the second car seat All at 600pm at night Anyone with a small child would understand the stress of this situation If I was travelling alone I think I would have been stuck there unable to hold my baby and fit a car seat at the same time Every other company we rented off during our holiday fitted these car seats for us If travelling with children I highly recommend another company Also the 12volt charger did not work This was very inconvenient for phone charging

Usually like Groupon however I bought one it was expiring could not get customer service till it expired they said I could still use it if i contacted seller which wasnt case Im out 60 plus another 15 for another
I called customer service multiple times because my business trip got cancelled I explained I would not have booked the room unless it was refundable because of the nature of the trip The ladies I spoke to became increasingly harder to understand as they became more agitated and rude while I was trying to calmly explain my situation I was then told to send a screen shot which I had that clearly showed the booking was refundable After sending it to customer service and calling to verify they received the screen shot I was told an investigation would be opened and I would receive a response within 2 days A week has passed and still no word
Even after the fact when I sent over the proof and there is no response This is completely unacceptable
The worst customer service ever Never booking through AMOMA again
Recently blogspot has started a campaign to help Zionists public image by banning anything they deem antiZionism or antiSemitism which is hilarious because they say antiZionism leads to antiSemitism wow what a bunch of jewery is this I dont stand for a company that censors Israeli crimes They are not subjected to special treatment I would love to see any other race for them to stick up for and I bet they only do this for Jews and in my eyes thats highly unethical and down right biased I will not support a company that wants to back Israel and its war crimes

I wanted to move on Sunday as I have a truck that day but was unable to book for Sunday or even Saturday Despite my efforts to reserve my space for the weekend the confirmation listed Monday This was not convenient for me at all
Absolute disgrace booked with them paid on my card for the hotel to ring one hour later telling me it was overbooked ring bookingscom for refund Rang them was told they would find somewhere else rang me to say they had found somewhere and they would pay the difference my husband drove 15 miles after work to be told no booking Rang them at 7 at night to be told I would have to wait 7 to ten days for a refund now sleeping in car 
I have ordered this twice and still didnt even get the second order
I put up tickets on this resale site because I wasnt able to attend the event I then found a solution and was able to go again As I went to take the tickets off the site it glitched and someone had bought the tickets stopping me from doing so I emailed requesting not to see but they gave me an air bill of 100 for cancellation which I understand and am happy with but I received another bill of 21340 stating that I have to pay For the buyers ticket equal or better to mine as stated in the TC my seats were no where near that price range and therefore Ticketmaster resale are basically asking me to pay for someones ticket to have a better seat then mine I then gave up trying to argue as it wasnt acceptable for me to pay 21340 the last email I received was the choice of a refund or ticket better than the one originally bought there is never a choice for the seller aka me to approve of these choices and therefore Ticketmaster resale only looks out for those buying not selling as all they want to do is con people into paying them an unreasonable amount of money the service provided towards my issue wasnt approach appropriately as the people laughed and disagreed to my opinions theyre trying to hide their arses as they know Im on to them because of this experience I will never use or trust Ticketmaster resale again as they have put me in a position that isnt fair on my behalf
Bills are not great just signed up not liking that I dont get a reminder email to read my meter readings Id like more feedback on usage
I bought recently black ink cartridge 240xlblackPG240XL I paid 1799 This cartridge was emptied after printing 10 maximum 15 pages of the regular test on the printer Cannon MG3500 I had to print my resume and printing has stopped on the half of page Unacceptable
Booked a flight with flight hub They gave me a fake number Even sent me a reminder I showed up at the airport only to be told that I was not a registered passenger and that they did not have any record of me I contacted Flighthub from the airport and they were useless hung up on me twice and told me that I was wrong Im at the airport How can I be wrong Left me with no other way to get home Had to sleep at the airport and make other arrangements with another airline Contacted them after and they refused to reimburse me Told me it was an airline problem that I needed to deal with to deal with them Asked to speak to a manager On hold for 25 hours
Dont trust them No customer service and they will not hesitate to take your money and run
Maybe there is a difference between ordering from the European warehouses vs from China reviews about the former seem better
I had an annoying experience having ordered the Yotaphone 2 international version from the Chinese warehouse I emailed Antelife after 34 days of no acknowledgement of my order no order confirmation email received A couple days following my email I got a short reply saying the phone had shipped a day earlier and was now in the process of delivery expected within 35 days I then asked them for an invoice and tracking information Another day passed and I was informed that they will provide the invoice once they have the tracking number
At this point I opened a dispute with PayPal Lo and behold I got an invoice from Antelife the same day
4 days later they sent me an email with a tracking number and a tracking website  and said that it usually takes 10 DAYS for the tracking info to update but my phone will be with me within 730 days  so still no usable proof or tracking info And they had the cheek to ask me to close the dispute with PayPal to which I said no
Another 45 days passed and I was about to cancel the whole thing with PayPal when I received a message from PayPal that Antelife refunded the money and the case was closed I received no apologies nor any explanation from Antelife In the end I only lost probably 34 weeks and a couple euros in conversion fee Im not sure if they were trying to scam me but when I ordered the phone their website said they had more than 10 in stock
So I ordered my shirt on the 9th they said I was delivered on the 13th but I never received it someone had stolen my package so never again will I order for this website
Searched Trivago for Cradle Mountain Tasmania booking Directed to HotelsClickcom then Expedia The photos of the room for which we paid 14250 plus international Transfer were nothing like what we were offered and we did not stay there We are still trying to get a refund I do not like our chances
My order have have been delivered with 53 days of travelling after my order and payment but unfortunately with a damaged package and 55  of customs tax and 1 missing item Normally there were 6 items in my order but I have received only 5 items
Besides the damage of my package it was entirely wet which includes an electronic battery charger for my motobike and I dont know if it will properly serve It has been officialy recorded as claim by the local delivery company PTT Cargo officials
Customers service is still investigating with DHL Most probably they will say that it is not their fault and ask me to forward my claim to the local distibutor PTT and leave me with incredibly poor delivery service and defected brand new items
Slow and not easy to navigate Could not log on to my Hilton account
First off the overall ease of using the website and the pricing of tickets was great No issues However I had a major issue when I went to print my tickets I purchased the tickets in November The day of the concert in February I tried to print the tickets but found that I didnt have an email to print them I logged in to my account and it said the tickets were available but I was unable to print them I called ticket city only to find out that my tickets I purchased were not honored by the seller Ticket city apologized for not notifying me but had I not called them they wouldve never told me In November they charged my credit card and sent me a confirmation number and said they would send me the tickets when they became available Somehow my account said they were available but obviously they werent It was all to confusing and almost ruined my trip Be careful
You dont want to know
I bought an item on 10th February 2017 not arrived yet my cards details saved I received a message that I have purchased something 33800 without my knowledge but when I asked for refund on the second day they want to investigate it could take upto 3 days
I have had stupid excuses
The management is self centered and greed appears to be the motivation The owner or head guy Steve uses employees and owners then kicks them to the curb not doing the right thing His employees take things and he does nothing about it Beware Vacation rental pros They tell you they will make things right then never contact you again hoping you will go away
Do not use online ordering from this store The restocking fee is not worth it Every other store allows returns without the penalty
Customer service is lacks knowledge of the products and company protocols Also the return policy is a hassle and inflexible to customer requests
Tried to cancel order messaged several times then told item posted
Want a refund I am not well ordered wrong item

UN DIA DESPUES RECIBO UN SEGUNDO MAIL DICIENDOME QUE HABIA ALGUNOS PRODUCTOS NO ESTABAN EN STOCK Y NO TENIAN FECHA DE REPOSICION
DE LOS 14 ARTICULOS SOLO PODIAN MANDARME 5 Y QUE YO TENIA 72HS PARA RESOLVER LA SITUACION

No comprendo bien el criterio que utilizan aunque me suena a estafa
Desde ya muchas gracias por el espacio

Very bad service
Initially customer service was fine Was told it would take an hour 2 12 hours later I was waiting withmy two very aggravated kids And still waiting
This is probably the worst company I have ever had to deal with Ive been trying to close my account for weeks now I just keep getting fobbed off with lies and rudeness You cant get to speak to a person in the UK and customer service wont let me speak to a line manager Im sick and tired of dealing with them  Iclear my balance in full always and my balance is zerohow hard can it be to close the account ffs
I had purchased a Michael Kors watch for 300
Watch arrived late Finally arrived after about week and half
Watch had a flat battery and even worse the second hand fell off
Extremely disappointed for a so called Trusted website
NZ Watch store purchases end off line watches or ones that didnt sell They then on sell it on their website for a discounted price
Would NOT recommend buying from this annoying frustrating website
Ive purchased from Home Zone before a few years back and had some trouble but decided to try them againit hasnt changed much The quality is still pretty poor and the service is worse Yes theyre very nice at the store when youre looking but as soon as you give them you money forget getting a hold of them I tried for almost a week before I could get someone to call me back and even then I had to be the one to calleven after multiple calls to try and get a hold of them to replaced my damaged headboard Well see how it goes
World famous rampant rabbit breaks just by turning on Had to return 2 now without even the pleasure of using it first
The sample I thought were to be different styles I received No stepin at all The ones I received were like diapers that are way to bulkeyIf you want I can send them back
I ordered 3 itemstotally wish I hadnt  When the items finally arrivedthey took agesthey were too late for the occasion Not only were they latethe sizes need to be seen to be believed no idea how their sizing worksI had used their guidesbut they were totally unreliableI wanted to return all 3 items but they wouldnt provide a return code for more than 1 I messaged themtold them I was not prepared to send each item back individually  sent all 3 back in one parcel at a cost of over 9 tonight they messaged that they will refund for the 1 they had given a return code forno mention of the other items which they have to have received tooThey owe me well over 40 but tell me theyre refunding just over 16 Diabolical serviceno matter how tempting things lookavoid this company
The flowers arrive one day later and were almost frozen I was so disappointed with it
Your sales reps should stop telling lies so that they can get a sale Im only with Energia since December and having notting but problems and when you ring cystomer care they are very rude We were just told we are not Airtricity we are not ESB we are Energia I have a letter written of complaimt written on and I will be leaving energis
If I could afford the listing fees on other sites like EBAY I would sell there were you are realistically getting reimbursed close to the actual value of the books you are listing
If it were not for the fact that I am sick of looking at the hundreds of crated books in my garage I would have searched more for a site that reimburses at a much more fair rate The length of time for payment as low as it is is also unacceptable Not a good experience but one that could be turned around if they gave better rates for brand new or rareOOP books
How could I rate it if I didnt get the service yet
I got a notification saying that the item I was waiting for became available so I went to their website and bought it I got an email confirming my purchase but that was it I didnt hear a word from them after that for over a week so I had to contact them Turned out that the item coming available was a mistake and they didnt know why it happened Not only did they get my hopes up they also charged me for the item that never got shipped Not a great experience
When I stumbled upon miniinthebox I got really excited because they have a ton of products theyre very affordable and they ship to my country I looked for reviews and saw that there were a lot of 5star and 1star ones which made me hesitate I am not an optimistic person but I gave miniinthebox a chance I ordered in hopes of receiving my package in a month at the latest as the estimated shipping time suggested I ordered on January 29 March 14 came and I messaged them they told me to wait until the 24th because there may have been delays So I waited 24th came and I messaged them and I found out that my package was lost in transit The first two tickets a sent I got a reply within 24 hours I was actually impressed by that The third one i sent I got a reply within an hour But when I said I wanted a refund they ignored me It has been 3 days and my ticket is still unresolved and I have messaged them 4 times Not a single response I went into this hoping for a good bargain but now Im just so disappointed and sad that this happened to me
Updated reviewBooking Reference 602956
Servicingstopcouk advertising 60 discount Please be advised if choosing to have a full service by Servicingstopcouk you will find is not a normal full service the Price Quote d Will be escalated by socalled additional work and parts normally included in a full service No service schedule received so no prof of the work carried out ther wasnt any water in the window washer after service My price Quote d was 118 and I ended up paying 35622 if paying with a credit card there will be another 250 added Also beware when paying there will also be another 44 added to the invoice this will need to be unticked added towards next years service When I spoke to the garage owners I was told they were only paid 182 by Servicingstopcouk for the workThats about 49 extra commission to Servicingstopcouk I feel very angry and will not consider a car service by this company ever again Please beware and go elsewhere
Servicing stop have asked to have my negative review removed is this normal practice to keep there ratings high
Update I have now reported this to Citizens Advice consumer service Also Trading Standards of the traders activities Hopefully will help to stop this kind of practice
We ordered 2 phone cases from TVC Mall and when they arrived one of them was a completely different design to what we had ordered Over the past few weeks we have sent 3 messages to TVC Mall advising them of the issue and despite it saying they will respond within 24 hours to date we havent received any response at all
Well the dress looked beautiful on the site The model was probably a foot taller than I was But the top was too big the sleeves were too loose The bottom looks excellent on my body The mesh is hideous I feel like it doesnt compliment my upper half at all I thought there would be breast cups but the Breast portion is sewn in Its so weird on my body that it doesnt even look like a two piece It looks like a one piece with a sliver of skin between the top and bottom of it Its pretty but not worth 350 dollars from your bank account The good thing about the dress is that the sleeves arent itchy at all like most would think
I ordered from Figis in 2015 and paid off my order on schedule In 2016 I was receiving catalogs saying I could order up to 700 and pay 35 a month I made an order for 99 and it was fulfilled
A couple weeks later I tried to make another order for some people Id decided to buy Christmas gifts for The order was for 75
I thought the gifts had been sent I was waiting to hear from the people
And I got a letter mailed to me from Figis saying that my credit report said that I had requested notification before ordering things on credit
Called Figis and spoke with them and they said they had everything cleared up and were going to send the gifts
I waited a couple more weeks and still no gift
I got another letter in the mail in spite of the fact that they had both my phone number and my email address saying that they had decided not to fulfill my order because of questions of fraud And also it said both that I had too many revolving accounts and not enough revolving accounts Hmm
So at Christmas time they dont send out things I ordered and wait for weeks to inform me of this fact by letter
I told them never to send me another catalog from ANY of their affiliates because why would I ever believe their offer of credit again
Its insane And they keep sending me their stupid catalogs
Hostel World do you realise that you are alienating a huge portion of your customers with your new advertising and email marketing scheme
I am cancelling my account I dont want to be associated with Charlie Sheen and also the deceptive wacky email bulletins you send  Charlie Sheen bats teen in hostel attack   It is not funny and not clever
You advertisers are IDIOTS with LAME ideas
Most of the things I bought from Easy Comforts were terrible made from cheap material and poor construction The ONLY reason I did not return all of the items I ordered is some are personal and the bag I bought I used it one 1 time only to find out it was damaged WITH A HOLE IN IT 
I was so happy when I ordered these things because I NEEDED THEM 
Only to find out the things are JUNK EASY COMFORTS IS A RIP OFF COMPANY 
Very disappointed
If you want lost you money  use paypal
most bad company what i try
first time I used this site they couldnt unlock the icloud but they refunded by voucher Now I want to use it again but there is error with their dalpay payment method and I tried to contact them but they do not answer
Confusing to use at first Unsafe and distracting to have to blow into it every 15 minutes
There was one price on the screen when I was shopping and a different price when I went to check out It had intro price which is deceiving and I put a lot of things back because they ended up being a lot more than I thought
Complicated check out process Overpriced clothes
bought nice expensive bed with expectations of advertised free TV but some how I picked the only bed that didnt qualify  bait and switch
I booked a flight with Oman Airways with credit card payment and booking cannot be found on the Travelgenio website even payment made
Dear customer service thank you replying

1 No confirmation of ticket as promised to my email address
2 booking reference number 6854749 on Travelgenio and name of guest are not appearing
3 booking does not appear on Oman air
Thank you for contacting me at 65 962 16 195
Just hope nothing goes wrong with your shipment or ordering process as Ive called and emailed this company over the past couple weeks and still no head way as far as where my package is I was supposed to recieve it about a month ago Customer service is defintely lacking here Very unhappy
We booked a 15day trip for around 475 and were not informed of a 1400  oneway fee until the payment screen It is lucky that we were able to cancel one of our flights otherwise we would have been SOL
Received my order in a timely manner but was disappointed by the quality Retaining snap that holds the folder in a partially open position was jammed Once unsnapped cannot resnap Overall material quality is basically embossed cardboard Functionality is ok but not really worth the purchase price
Should be against the law the way this company is allowed to operate They advertise as a local florist in any city you can name however they are in NJ and everything is farmed out or shipped UPS The phone service is atrocious as they leave you on hold forever and then cut you off If you do have any customer service issues they fail to take any blame and only offer partial credit and then store credit as if you would ever use it When they do send UPS they do not send tracking info so you never know about delivery All you can do is dispute with your credit card company Dont ever use your debit card
Over an hour late Blocked traffic by not pulling truck all the way to curb on a narrow street And parked on no parking side Told several drivers my neighbors they didnt know how to drive Even though really was just barely enough room to pass the truck When removing old couch the dragged it along every surface When bringing new one also dragged it against everything Enough to scratch leather on bottom of couch Then told me I should of signed a waiver so its really my fault But thats OK cause he colored it in with a marker to fix it And thats what I really wanted was a new leather couch with a scratch fixed with brown marker No more GarderWhite for me
the worse service
After almost six days my booking still wasnt confirmed I couldnt book a Gps or any other extras upon booking and when i tried to do so on the App and wrote you I hadnt seen any update regarding that on my profile
This company is the absolute worst If you live in the states and are unable to call a European number for free then STAY AWAY You will only be able to communicate with them via email and they will take on average 5 business days to reply
The agents are extremely unhelpful I purchased a ticket in May 2016 for a trip to Trinidad in February 2017 They ended up charging my card TWICE but the problem was fixed via my bank Of course I purchased the insurance but make sure to read carefully which insurance because one of them is basically a hoax I turned ill and had to cancel the trip When it came to using my insurance which I paid extra for I was hit with the BIGGEST HASSLE of life You would think that they were refunding me my money from their own personal pay check It was ridiculous I provided them with a doctors note and they refused to accept it Short of turning in my personal medical records they refused to honor the insurance policy that I paid extra for Mind you this was after it took them days to reply to my email requesting to cancel I had to practically research every departments email before receiving a response When they finally responded to my 3rd email it was to copy and paste the insurance policy no real explanation as to why they wouldnt cancel just that they deemed my doctors note invalid Finally my doctor contacted them personally on the hospitals phone super long distance and they informed me the hospitals stamp was required I am not sure why they are going through such measures to assist me when I purchased insurance and provided them with a doctors note
Finally they are willing to let me use my insurance for my ticket The problem with the refund is because they double charged my card in May my bank closed that card for my protection The refund for my security could only be submitted to that card The email from their agent requested I inform them how I would like to move forward once I have contacted my bank I replied back and specifically told them NOT to refund but to instead reschedule my ticket I wrote them at least four times and waited over a week for a response I finally called the airlines directly yesterday 3617 only to find out that they had refunded the ticket already without my approval This refund only gave me 85 of my money back instead of allowing me to reschedule with the full amount of my ticket
Needless to say you are better off booking with expedia or priceline I would rather pay more to not feel like I have been scammed The amount of stress I gained while being sick and dealing with their terrible customer service has been ridiculous Planning your vacation is not worth all of this hassle Stay away from this INEFFECTIVE company
The photograph is a serious misconception for the end product you receive Sadly not only was it a dinky little vase but the flowers were wilted and the ribbon was faded When I called customer service they insisted on calling the person I sent the flowers to confirming what I was telling themthen I learned AVAs is only a call service and the actual florist that sent the flowers called her also they refused to give me a credit for the nasty bouquet and insisted they would resend another arrangement What a joke There were several other arrangements and sadly mine was the worst looking one there Incredibly embarrassing and it cost 8000
This is one of the most poorly run businesses I have ever encountered Worse than a cable company Does not care about customers and will do anything to make more money Will just put you on hold andor not respond to emails when they want to avoid a complaint that is a result of their horrible malfunctioning devices and greedy policies You are forced to pay whatever they say if you want to get through your IID requirement and they CERTAINLY take advantage of that
I signed up to Energia before Christmas 2016 I was told my unit rate would be 01132 per unit I supplied my direct debit details upon signing up My first bill never arrived but I did receive a letter informing me that my account was in arrears I rang to ask why the bill hadnt been taken from bank account to be told they never set up the direct debit I was to receive a call back the next day to set up the direct debit I never got the call I contacted them again yesterday and was told that I would receive a call between 9 and 930 this morning but once again I didnt receive a call I am being charged a rate of 01635 per unit not what I signed up to
Write some times dron do not work no answer
I never buy with them again
The process did not help as we could not get access to the original password so I spent my 5700 in vain
Why are you not accepting paypal
What is OTP
Before signing contract I explained how I paid all billswas told I could continue with same method with energiadefinitely given wrong informationas a result have had a lot of bank charges against my account so will be changing companies as soon as is possible
I was guided through the whole process by Jackie which had the utmost knowledge of what I needed to accomplish and took my by the hand through the phone and walked me through the process painlessly
Thank you for your help

You can do 1 change and then you need to cancel your booking if you want to adjust it further
What is this And this is hidden you can only find out via customer service when the system not capable of doing this itself
Unacceptable and unreasonable
Talk to your customers
DO NOT use Reservation Counter to book ANYTHING I was told I could book adjoining rooms and when I arrived I was told I could not I was visiting DC to celebrate my best friends promotion in the military so we wanted adjoining rooms and we were going to call a few places but basically were lied to so that we would book Very bad customer service
Mostly your equipment breaks within a couple years or less like cheap stuff made in china you might buy at the show with kids So if it werent for the fact you were around the corner from where I live  I would definitely go somewhere else
Used them before effectively This time they sent the wrong product their fault Its taking ages to rectify and I didnt appreciate the sarcasm when I rang to ask the timeframe to resolve the problem
Things go wrong Effective communication helps us to work through the problem
I requested monogrammed terse pillowcases I received them with the monogram on the back side of the pillowcase ie the nonflange side both on the same side corner In order to see the monograms on my bed I would need to show the back of the pillowcases both opened edges facing the same direction
I was offered a 20 discount on a future order as compensation but this does not rectify the problem
The order form indicates by default the monogram would be put in a corner  I assumed this company has done this quite a few times and would place the monograms in a corner appropriate for showcasing on a dressed bed otherwise why bother having them
in response to the company reply just to be clear the website only states monogramming would be done in a corner It did not state on the top left when I ordered Otherwise I would have made a special request

One of my items didnt arrive I called the shipping company first they referred me to Groupon I called Groupon who referred me to the merchant I refused to call the merchant  because this has become a customer service issue WITHOUT the service Im still waiting for resolution This is the first time Ive had this issue IT SUCKS
I will never ever buy anything from Kellerssport again
They have charge me for Premium membership for 2017 although I did not order it
I did buy it for 2016 but only for 1 year and I do not want it for this year
And besides that they have send me 2 invoices for Premium membership that I not have ordered
If you buy it once you have to log in to Kellers and cancel it if you not want to buy it any more
When I contacted them was the answer
 Pay or you will get reminders and after that it will go for collection
Very bad treatment from the Kellerssport company and the customer support
Pago 49 euro X 525 mila FIFA COINS
Trasferisco i crediti e subito dopo MI COMPARE UN MESSAGGIO DI EA DOVE MI VIENE AZZERATO TUTTO
NON FATE IL MIO STESSO ERRORE
TRUFFATORI
We had requested delivery on 20th Feb on my sons birthday however the delivery was made on 21st Feb one day after the party  cake was also not soft
The packing was very good 
I purchased a Sony XBR75X940D on their web site I got an email to confirm my purchase I called and they asked if I wanted the tv that was made in Mexico or the made in China model Geeze Lots of lies and stupid stuff to try and get me to buy tge better version Price increased 1200 Ive been through this type of bait and switch crap before I cancelled the order
First time using it and had trouble receiving my tickets Took more than was expected Decided to call and tickets we never sent out event was 23 days after I called
I ordered a set of hairdryer and am missing a part in the box Ive been trying to contact the customer service by email for the complete week and still have not got a single reply I also used the chat function on their website  no one answers There is no phone nr you can call either There is no customer service
Please pack items with original pack I bought 900 clothes but you put them into a box without any bag protected Its like fake products I spend 900 on your service so i want to be treated as so Dont say your items are real so you just unpack them and throw into a box and then send to me
The website was easy and simple to use but once I submitted my payment my flight was changed now Im unable to fix and and will be sick with my child overnight somewhere there isnt an option to fix it unless calling the airport and they wont let me change it now either Pretty messed up since I booked less than 20mins ago Very disappointed
Scuffed a wheel rim on kerb left a slight graze about 6 inches charged me 125 eurosno debate no explanation other than they would have to buy a new wheel rim  As if 
I have recently purchased an Eames Lounge chair however I am still waiting for it to be delivered
It is quite unclear whether Modecor have the item in stock or not I checked daily their website and it seems that the availability date is constantly changing A day ago this armchair was available and ready to be shipped today it says it will be available from some future date The same confusion subsisted when I paid for my purchase more than 3 weeks ago
I have been scammed a couple of months ago by Wallace Sacks who went bust see also reviews on Trustpilot they were rated 8710 when I paid more than 1000 for a couple of armchairs  they have zero ratings now and is currently under administration due to mainly the lack of stock I just hope Modecor will not become the villain too
Not really happy with the delay in the delivery of my armchair from Modecor The costumer service only told me that theyd deliver last Monday its now Saturday and they still havent replied to may email returning a tracking number let alone delivering my purchase
Very dissatisfied costumer Think twice before buying anything from Modecor Check that they have stock at least Dont buy in advance
I would be happy to add more stars to my review should I receive my chair or be contacted by the costumer service with a plausible explanation for the delay
Your staff needs better sound isolation I could hear other staff which was very distracting The email and text notifications were never delivered
There is a lot lacking in the website Moving back and forth from the cart to the rest of the page was very difficult as too many things are consistently popping up
My biggest upset After spending time deciding in between which two promos I wanted to choose I finally decided i wanted the Unix outfit I tried to add it to cart and it couldnt be added I thought perhaps it could be a problem with my computer which i restarted but it was not I wanted that specific outfit because I really liked the Lisette full leggings  not the ones that are 34 length which are sold on the leggings page but the full leggings which are not Called customer service They couldnt figure it out either
Disappointed in the failed attempt with customer service trying to add it to my cart Sad because I had to order a different set of leggings
Hopefully you guys fix the problem
The only thing the installation people did was show me how to start my vehicle  When I got home with the packet it took me three tries to finally reach someone  When I did no one really knew how to proceed or even what was in my packet  VERY unorganized  vague
The garage they used didnt correctly lock my wheelnuts so 2 days afterwards my entire wheel fell off whilst I was driving off the motorway Whilst they accepted the need to fix it they only fixed the main damage and not that caused as a result of hitting the verge Terrible customer service lack of communication and ruined Christmas Dont trust them at all
Unethical  after contact with the Office of Fair Trading and RACQ Still could not get my deposit refunded back
Only concerned about selling their finance their insurance paint protection window tinting and making money
Disorganised
I did get an apology about how I was treated
Originally I had ordered a cargo mat At pick up this wasnt discussed
You would think they may have been thrown it in as a way of honouring the apology or as a sign of good will 97
Never again will I buy direct with a dealership I will use the brokers associated with RACQ andor Qld Teachers Union
I am very disappointed by my experience as a client of united domains From the second I placed my purchase I have received dozens of spam mails from around the world lousy designers programmers and so on This is an unacceptable pressure on upgrading to anonymize domain names whereas this option should be free as it does not require any additional work or fee from the provider
I will not return
Only sent 1 of 2 items said the other was out of stock but when I checked it was instock Requested them to send it reply said would have to reorder it  gone up by 2  and pay 250 postage again Despite ordering lot in past not use again poor customer service
My expreience with Gardner White has not been great I dont know if i will going back for business and if I do a miracle will need to happen
The package was delivered to the wrong pickup location I clearly specified from the choices given the location where I wanted to pick up my package but my request was ignored
Regarding your response I did not specify a selfservice machine for delivery I specifically chose to have the package left at a shop close to my home
My friend never received her cake that I ordered for her birthday When I called customer service and told them what happened they offered me a 20 off coupon for another one and that was it Unfortunately would not recommend this company
I had a malodour problem in the restaurants washoom so I contacted Initial for solution The Air freshener is costeffective and it did help me solve the problem The staff is professional and friendly I would recommend Initial to anyone
Dont know what Trustpilot is but take me off your mailing list NOW
I have tried contacting through their website through email 4 times and have yet to receive any response
I have used SkyLux a number of times now Africa East Coast and Caribbean and most recently Central America Theyve always found great business class rates for me and my friends took 4 others to Africa 2 others to Central America
But at some point they sent me a thank you credit for 200 for the business I had directed their way so this time I decided to use it for the trip to Central America with another couple only to be told that it didnt apply for this trip Some thank you We had just purchased nearly 5k worth of tickets but the 200 credit they had offered didnt apply The discount is minimal the treatment speaks volumes on how much they value my business
Sat in my 12 unit condo for an Amazon delivery all day At 330 Amazon advised the package could not be delivered at 320 I seriously doubt the driver even got out of the truck because they require an entry code for the building
I have no control over who Amazon decides to ship with Canada Post DHL and UPS have never had any requirements How is the customer supposed to know
There is an intercom at the front door with 11 names on it All that was required was to find our name and press the button Or call us at the phone number on the order
Apparently the customer can waste a whole day but the driver doesnt tell inclined to even try
Worst service ever I will be providing this feedback to Amazonvs and writing the Minister responsible for Canada Post who is responsible for this company
Appalling
I ordered flowers to be delivered two weeks prior to Valentines Day I received an email on Valentines Day that they had tried to call and email my recipients They lied they had done neither and abruptly canceled my order Totally infuriating Losers and unprofessional
I cannot believed that this company can lie  cover all the mistake without regards to peoples paying the mistakes I learned so much dealing with this company Check  double check this company before agreeing to make a purchased because it will cost you big time  they will not care
I was ecstatic about my buy but received it with a cracked screen I emailed them 2 times and never got a response at all Now im stuck with a non functioning device But they are quick on taking your funds dont buy from them
I ordered an Iwata starter kit from Chicago Airbrush Supply as well as a couple of accessories They notified me the same day that they didnt have the compressor in stock and that it would be shipping from Iwata The airbrush itself and my accessories shipped within a day or so and arrived within the week My problem started with the accessories I ordered an extra cup  lid system fine and a lid for the cup the brush came with Well it turned out there was a mistake on their website so I thought the airbrush came with a 14 oz cup when it actually came with a 18 oz cup Based on the information on the website Id ordered the 14 oz lid which naturally didnt fit Before I noticed the error on the website I called them up to tell them my lid wasnt workingdidt fit and the guy who answered just didnt really want to hear what I had to say and told me to call the manufacturer like he just assumed I had a defective product  I dont I have the wrong product While I had him on the line I asked about how long I should expect it to take for the compressor to arrive again he referred me to Iwata and said I could ask them that when I called about the cup I shrugged it off thinking Id gotten the fulfillment guy who really didnt know the answers so after I got off the line I did some poking around and realized what the problem was I sent CAS an email explaining it and with a picture No answer So I called again and left a voicemail No answer So I emailed again No answer So I sent a message through their website No answer So I just called again and their voicemail box is full Clearly I am not the only one having a problem This is disappointing because their prices are competitive and I like supporting small businesses but this has been really frustrating This should be an easy fix Incidentally about a week after I placed my order I called Iwata for a status update The woman I spoke to was really helpful They did have my order but the compressors are backordered Iwata is expecting a shipment early this week and told me to call back on Friday to see if my unit has shipped yet Glad I called otherwise Id have been sitting here wondering if my unit was walking from Oregon to New York
Currently Lyft is holding hundreds of dollars from me and saying its out of their control Blaming authorization holds and technology issues Theyve even mentioned theyve been hacked and drivers are losing their hard earned money
When I first signed up to drive for Lyft they screwed up with my vehicle verification document and had me drive back to do another verification very inconvenient to me
I drive for both Uber and Lyft Ive never had as many issues with the app or getting paid on time by Uber Lyft in my opinion needs to sell out to Uber or a bigger company to smooth out these supposed glitches
I bought eyeglasses Ray ban its look completely fake
Do not use this service they are absolutely hopeless First problem  we arrived at Vancouver airport from Australia to fly on to Comox on Vancouver Island having prepaid via Travelgenio for two pairs of skis Air Canada had no record of the payment and we had to pay again Travelgenio replied that they would not refund the payment as the airline had not confirmed that we had paid for extra baggage Apparently it was our responsibility to confirm that the service we had paid for through Travelgenio would actually be delivered Second and most serious problem  our flight out of Comox back to Vancouver on Central Mountain Air was cancelled We didnt find this out from Travelgenio but from checking ourselves to confirm the flight Right up to two weeks before we were to fly back to Vancouver Travelgenio were insisting the flight had not been cancelled despite the fact that we had spoken to Central Mountain Air something Travelgenio obviously did not do who confirmed they were definitely not flying out of Comox Through the efforts of a fantastic Air Canada employee we managed to get transferred to an Air Canada flight but if we had left it to Travelgenio we would have missed our international connection back to Australia Hopeless incompetent and borderline shonky and I have the entire email trail to prove it
I ordered a next day delivery one week ago and still havent received it I wasnt in when they delivered it 2 days after order so i arranged for it to be picked up at a preferred pick up point It took 4 days for it to be delivered to the preferred pickup point When i went to collect it yesterday i was told the parcel wasnt there because there was a barcode problem I travelled 9 miles to get my parcel to be made aware there was a problem with the barcode and the parcel wasnt there A waste of my time money  a lack of communication I deserve a refund If i dont receive one i will undoubtedly never use this service ever again and will recommend to others to do the same
i booked a flight with bravofly Lagos to Calgary with layovers at addis ababa and London Heathrow airport then transit to the London Gatwick airport for the flight to Calgary operated by Ethiopian Airlines and WestJet Ive been able to confirm my bookingsreservations for the Ethiopian airline flights from Lagos to Heathrow but Im unable to confirm my bookingreservation for the WestJet flight from Gatwick to Calgary It says we have no record of your reservation and this is causing me to panic WS0002 March 4

Im a digital marketing director for a Fortune 500 company And I have a hard time wrapping my mind around how a seemingly successful online retailer offers such a poor mobile experience  in my caseon an iOS tablet Nothing dynamic to provide the optimum experience which resulted in lackluster performance on the desktop rendering I even looked for an app thinking perhaps thats how I could make the experience far less painful Its very much a missed opportunity as Im seriously considering canceling my VIP account Its too much of a pain to shop on your site using the device where I do 99 of my online shopping
Takes to long to process  before shipping I placed this order on March 17 and my script was current and already on file from my first order Today March 30 2017 I received notice that my order has shipped I am very disappointed It took over 3 weeks to get my first order even though I faxed my script on the day of my order I assumed that was because it was my first order and though I would order from OptiContacts one more time This order is taking just as long and it is inappropriate The price was good but I am sure I can find another company at the same price  that provides faster processing
I ordered flowers for my parents wedding anniversary I usually use Interflora Why did I change I have just tracked the flowers for their delivery date and see that they will be delivered the next day What is the point in using a company that cannot deliver for when you order Truly shoddy
So I went into Harvey Normans to get my computer fixed after I noticed that it was constantly crashing especially after I try to download from the internet They claimed that they sent my laptop for repair with Toshiba 2 weeks later I got my laptop back and it was far from what I had expected the webcam no longer works they disenabled my scroll pad and other features which were compatible with my laptop before these features are no longer compatible I called up Harveys they told me to come in I spoke with the manager and they attempted to dribble me by telling me to call up chrome if its running too slow and all the other website which where lagging on the new system they supposedly installed Then they put a man on the phone who supposedly fixed my laptop I didnt know Toshibas engineers had time to make personal phone calls  
This is not the first time I have had a bad experience with Harvey Normans Be careful when dealing with such an awful company I remember buying a tablet from them and what saw displayed was different from what the sales assistant handed me in the box Got home to realise it was china made the battery life barely lasted half an hour
We purchased a recycled cartridge for our HP printer When we receive ever it it was defective and they promised to send another immediately A week later when we called we were told that it never was sent Completely unacceptable
Sent wrong size and direction for return too small and ink too light to read so couldnt print out return lable Could have handled one size too big but not two
I received a gift certificate and while trying to redeem it on a purchase first it was accepted as store credit then it said redeemed and then it wouldnt take it off my total I am trying really hard to like this site but it is so much easier at many others that I shop regularly In the mean time I have paid full price and I still cant redeem my creditbeyond frustrating
First time that someone hasnt refund me the full amount of money After sending back the TShirt I just got back some of money but not all of it Since then they havent responded to any mail I also had to contact them in first place to get my refund
thought i was lucky to grab the thing i want but SSENSE sent me a wrong size Since then my size has been sold out i could have gotten it if SSENSE did its job properly
I ordered my product online and received an email the next day that stated East Coast Medical Supply has sent you a package It also contained the tracking number and mailing date of 210 which was Friday When I checked the tracking number on the 13th which was Monday it said USPS had not received the package yet just the preshipment info The actual package did not make it to USPS till Tues 214 and I finally received it on the 16th
The email I received after ordering was misleading I believed my package was on the way on the 10th when it actually did not even get sent out till the 14th
East Coast did promptly apologize and actually gave me a refund after they found out I was dissatisfied which surprised me I am thankful and I believe it was probably just a miscommunication I will probably consider giving them another chance in the future
I really hope this company goes bankrupt treating customers like a number on a page
Never received order despite being charged for it and received no response when contacting customer service
We booked a holiday city package to Majorca with lastminutecom 6 days before the scheduled trip First of all you cant call it a booking its more like a request for a booking Theyll send you a confirmation within 24 to 48hours In this day and age of the internet you shouldnt have to wait more than 1 minute to receive a booking confirmation So we waited more than 48hours and started to get nervous if we would received confirmation or not We made calls to their helpline based in India of course with people called Michael or David I doubt its ever their real names You could tell theyre Indian with their accent yet they give you false names How can a company ever pretend to be honest when their workers are given false names to talk with customers Anyway waited for confirmation never received so we called and asked them to cancel the booking which we havent received confirmation of the cancellation either What a disgrace of a company Bravofly have acquired lastminutecom and theyre both poorly managed companies Do yourself a favor and book your flights directly with the airlines and use Bookingcom for hotels At least you will get instant confirmation
They promptly delivered 2 of the 3 things I ordered but I am still waiting on the third item I was told it would be shipped last week but UPS Tracking shows that a shipping label was generated but the package has not yet shipped
I was told immediate replacement would be sent if I would send photo of defective game Despite sending photo same day I have not heard from customer service since I sent several follow up emails but no response to any of them When calling phone number message says no phone calls allowed and to please correspond by email only Email vs phone is not a problem but failing to answer or acknowledge emails with no other recourse is a big problem Taking money without providing purchased item or service is fraud

I felt like I was being attacked as soon as I walked in the door with this huge dialogue from the greeter who was less than thrilled to be there She even included in her very long speech which she explained the rules of how to shop in the store that if we didnt like it we could talk to the owner who was there that day Ummm ok She must of read the look on our faces because we hadnt said anything but Im sure she gets the same look from all the patrons that enter the store after her very very long speech of what NOT to do in the store My daughter was there for only one dress but we were told we would have to select three others to try on register in their computer system after 3 dresses were selected then go to customer service where they would print a photo of the dress we were actually looking for then once our number was called we could go to a fitting room and ask the sales lady there if they had the dress Something that could have taken 5 min took over an hour I felt bad because girls were busseling about asking if this was our first second or third dress and I just straight up said we dont want any of these just the one we came here for which we cant even see if you have until we do all this other stuff Complete waste of time After an hour they had the dress fit my daughter like a glove purchased it and left What I learned 1 As a business owner I will never treat my customers this way 2 I would have rather given my money to anyone else but them because they wasted my time however they had the dress that no one else had so they got the money 3 I dont think there was a 3 1  2 were enough
Your products are not good and coming very late
Prologue Firstly it is worth noting that I am not typically one to write reviews or even complain for that matter and it takes something fairly considerable in order for me to spend a good chunk of my Sunday night writing such a review but I feel this is worth it
Chapter 1
Arriving late at the airport Saturday night we were keen to get through quickly Only one of the rental places had a long queue inevitably ours  Goldcar Stood for 20 minutes before moving as there was a lady arguing at the front about insurance I thought its fine Ive paid for full coverage Im insured After an hour got to the front of the queue lady tells me I am not insured note this was an outright lie I was insured and that I must pay 135 eur extra for full coverage I refused she got quite irate by this but proceeded nonetheless to take the deposit of 1400 euros off my credit card She then asked me for a debit card to pay 105 euros I asked why since my booking told me I had nothing more to pay Fuel and taxes Right so how does that work out at 95cents a litre I refused but she pointed out that I couldnt take the car unless I paid it She also rudely pointed at the queue behind me saying I was wasting everyones time Reluctantly I paid the 105 euros as like everyone else I wanted to get on with my holiday I later realised the queues are purposeful and they try and make you feel bad for staying and arguing
Anyway we get to the car and the aerial was missing and there were a few scratches on the car that werent marked on the sheet but there was no one around and rather than go back and queue for another 2 hours it was so late that we just took photos and left emailing them to myself for a date stamp
Chapter 2
Halfway through the holiday I though I heard a faint sound so we pulled over and sure enough there was a nail  washer in the car tyre However this nail looked so worn in I took photos that it looked like it had been there for a long time although I obviously had no evidence The tyre was still inflated and I could have carried on driving However I wasnt comfortable with this so called Goldcar head office I asked them what they wanted me to do and they were as much use as a chocolate teapot I told them look Im going to change over to the space saver and drive in and get another car The woman on the phone oh okay Ill let them know to expect you 2 hours later I turned up at the airport on the space saver The guy there told me Id have to discuss it at the front desk heart sinking Another queue whilst I watch people get shafted for fuel and insurance including a girl in front of me crying because she didnt have enough money There was also a chap behind me who was on his stag do and missed the first three hours because his car was scratched and there wasnt any recording of the damage Whilst in the queue I watched one lady behind the desk serve customers and two others move bits of paper around whilst there was a huge queue Absolutely disgraceful  and I wasnt sure this was whether they were again driving the queue up or simply couldnt face any customers Prepared for what was to come I got to the front and was told Id have to pay 200 euros for the tyre  I showed the lady on the desk the photo and explained that if Id wanted to I could have driving on the tyre with a nail in it and returned it 2 days later and no one would have known She said it must have been me since they always check the cars between customers  as above this is clearly not the case She again told me there was a queue behind me and I pointed out politely that this was because she was causing the problems not resolving them I had to bite the bullet and pay 200 euros for the tyre she briefly tried to sell me the super relax cover again on the new car before I told her where to go Needless to say the new car we were given again had scratches and a missing aerial that were not marked on the sheet Again we took photos and emailed them to ourselves
Chapter 3
Returning the car to the airport I was full of dread worried what pain Goldcar would inflict on the last of my holiday To my surprise they didnt even check the car the guy chucked the keys in with a bundle of others and we just walked off This was the most painless part of the process but I realised its just because Goldcar are a shambles organisation and dont actually do any of there due diligence that sometimes would work against them  I realised in hindsight I could have taken a key and scratched the side of the car and they could probably never have proved it was me due to their complete ineptitude
Fortunately I had a great holiday but this was a real downer on a weeks holiday spending so much time at the airport I witnessed so many peoples holidays get off to a bad start that I swore to myself I would follow it up  which is what Im doing now Do yourselves a favour go nowhere near Goldcar I realise now that Goldcar rely on undercutting people on comparison websites then fleecing you at the desk which actually makes it significantly more expensive My suspicion is that they are aware this is a non sustainable business model and they realise that their reputation will eventually catch up with them My worry is that the owners get away with it and make a tidy profit doing so How many holidays ruined before this point I dont know Id love the owners to have stood in that queue for 2 hours and witnessed what I did
Anyway thats it unfortunately there is no happy ending other than to learn from it and try and make others aware so they dont make the same mistake
The quality of the product we received was very poor it snapped when we fitted it On contacting the shower doctor they passed the buck to the manufacturer and then blamed us no apology for having a problem with their product When we replied telling them we were disappointed with the response they didnt even have the decency to reply We will NOT be using the shower doctor again
2 days before my trip they call me to say the Hotel I booked was cancelled because of overbooking Offered me another one almost 3km away I said I need another one  they offered me one closer  I confirmed then they come back saying thats not available
Now theyve offered me another one and still waiting to hear from them with a confirmation My flight is in less than 20hrs and I have nowhere to sleep I will have to take this to another level if this is not sorted
I found an extra charge on my credit card after one of my hires no explanation or reason given I called Rentalcar who told me to send an email to reservations reservations replied and told me to go to my rental online and contact customer service The second advice was correct
I am waiting a response
This is the second time I have had excess charges last time I had to cancel my credit card Such a faff considering booking directly in future which I am guessing is Europcars strategy
took vehicle into Capalaba for a booked 24000 KL tyre service told the vehicle would be ready in an hour and a half hour and a half later they had not started on the work car in parking lot the service man was unreasonable and rude in saying take the car and offered no reason for the vehicle not being ready
This is unacceptable when the vehicle was booked in the service
Before ordering contact lenses I checked with VDs customer service staff online as to whether their invoices display the details necessary to claim through my healthfund When I was informed this would be the case I ordered my lenses They arrived with no invoice I contacted VD assuming this was just a small error that could be fixed quickly Unfortunately a detail on my invoive was incorrect It took 11 emails back and forth over 8 days to fix one error on an invoice It was a frustrating experience which highlighted VD inability to resovle a simple error in a timley manner
Do not book a Hotel room here Customer service is horrible Booked here dozens of times never needed them Then once I booked here by phone and they made a mistake So when arriving at the hotel we only had rooms for 3 people instead of 5 With confirmation on email from their own employee they just sayd sorry cantt help you ather waiting on the phone for 5 hours speaking to 9 agents Cost me 570 US   international roaming costs for telephone use more then 70 Please do yourself a favour and dont book here
When there is a holdup with an account or an item goes on back order after being ordered Hubert does a poor job of reaching out to the customer When someone is expecting a 24hour turn around for an order to ship but it does not Hubert relies on the customer to reach out for an update and then the live chat crew seems clueless as to why the customer is frustrated If the status of an order changes or there is a problem with a payment Hubert should reach out directly first
I had bad experience ever with purolator
Hope amazon does not ship with them anymore
Delivery guy was so rude
I didnt get any notice of messages when they were downstairs just left me a message and they wanted me to come pick it up at purolator location
Lie in each word They lie about refund policy they lie about delivery time
I sold a ticket through Ticketbis I received a refund for posting it out Special Delivery but I have yet to receive payment for the ticket I sold This was last November and I just keep being told that it is being looked into and I never get a response There is no number to call the complaints department direct Ticketbis keep asking for my banking details and telling me they are incorrect which is why payment has not been processed This doesnt explain why they have paid me back for postage but are struggling to make the payment for the ticket I sold Wont be using this company again
We have not received our products yet We are very dissapointed
I booked my HotelFlight and after one day of booking I realised that there is problem with optaining visa for the host country I traied to cancel and get refund but after a week still I havent received anything and Ive been told they only refund less than a1 of money that I have paid this means I am losing lots of hard cash earned and this is very much painful
Wig was in very bad condition when it arrived it looked nothing like to stock card
I boxed up and sent my books to them on good faith I tracked the package and knew when it got to them then waited and waited for them to process the order
Once they processed the order they claimed that there was a book missing and refused to pay me for it
I will NEVER use them again or recommend them to anyone
I recently changed my name when I sent all the required documents to them they responded by sending me an email saying and I Quote After reviewing your PayPal account weve determined there to be excessive risk involved in doing business with you and wed like to begin parting ways and limiting my account Their support staff also made a point of dead naming me over and over I got my account back in the end but only after complaining I have no doubt that had I not kept complaining via twitter and Facebook that that would have been it No one gave me an explanation as to why it happened and no one apologized
PayPal rely on you not knowing your rights
Ill be deleting my account with them why would I want to continue doing business with a company that will do that
Dont use them
Zero customer service zero quality awful service all round
Just arrange your own work with a local garage you trust so they get the money and you get the quality service
Any issues this company will not help you at all
KW Scarily had exactly the same and proved it to them They just ignore all contact Go to CAB or OFT
Contacted you at least 10 times and you just ignore my emails and wont speak to me Fantastic service Cant wait till the OFT turn up and close you down
2702  still nothing from these jokers Pretend to be interested then do nothing Have claimed person you spoke to is in another team so please relog all info and complaint AVOID YOU WILL BE STUNG BY THIS COMPANY
0103 Still nothing To be clear this is 5 weeks now and not one phone call received or accepted and constant delaying tactics Keep complaining to authorities people and use Chargeback via your Bank if you are not satisfied with workfees charged This lot wont be here much longer they are being investigated just need more people to report complaints and provide the evidence of what they are doing
had to pay using paypal and the charges were more than the cost of the game itself
rereply Perhaps look at changing paypal charges to something similar to the commission they get then if your alternative payment methods arent stable
OK for year one then massive increase It was very difficult to contact them and then they refused to explain the huge increase To me a company who carry on like this have no integrity and I would be more at ease dealing with a company who charge me more Am advising Facebook correspondents to be very cautious if dealing with them In spite of numerous requests they vhave still not explained their conduct Approach with caution I have gone elsewhere
I bought a fishing charter through Groupon schedule it twice the charter canceled due to weather twice and were going on the third year to try to schedule again cannot get a refund stuck trying to use it yet the charter company Refuses to cooperate
As one who eschews social media I found it difficult  nay obstructive  to sign up in order to leave a review  Additionally when working with another of my companies I found that Trustpilot allows rogue companies to remove unfavourable reviews clearly this is unacceptable
I have just left my first review  for a company that started spamming me out the blue I fully expect Trustpilot to remove it even though it IS an honest reflection of what went on and is documented
Given my previous experience I already dont trust Trustpilot time will tell if theyve improved and started flying straight or if theyre still just a Blimp full of rogues But Im not hopeful

When I received my tshirt It came to me in an unsatisfactory condition When I put the tshirt on there was a big thread hanging down from the inside and as I looked at it there was a hole about an inch and a half long in underneath the armpit
But food distribution time and good cost too But unfortunately Ive had to have the tshirt sewn as I need it for work
I tried to place an order online but the street address kept changing from Drive to Lane I called customer service and placed the order over the phone using my credit card I got a confirmation number from the person over the phone I waited for over a week but did not get my order I called back customer service who told me they were still waiting on the payment to go through I was so upset I canceled the order
I had to return some items and I had to pay everything
Terrible customer service
Had been trying to contact the customer service through email and website but no reply The company does not offer phone contact means no buyers and sellers could contact them directly Not a good experience
Booked a hotel and paid via ewallet The money was taken by Agoda and the room at the hotel cancelled as apparently WeChat would not authorise the payment although it had already been taken I was told that the refund had been processed and I had to wait 10 working days for the refund I did not receive it and then was told this was an error I have had to twice prove they took the money as they maintain they hadnt taken it Situation at the moment is that after nearly a month of trying to get a refund I am now being told I have to wait 30 days after the processing date for the refund to be back in my ewallet
When we started out Tim Collins was very helpful but after a few weeks Tim would not return our phone calls or emails I find that very unprofessional Luck for us Theresa Pera was very helpful and if not for her we may not have gotten our mortgage If I had to do over I would not have worked with Tim Collins in your company
It used to be possible to ship cameras and batteries to Puerto Rico now I have to buy them elsewhere For an online camera shop not being able to ship cameras to customers is a bit of a problem and reduces BH to being a lenses and accessories shop

Dear DHL team
how can we explain to leave our packages in front of our apartment if we are awaywe mention it on the internet page but it doesnt help Once you took away flowers with a cake back and left a note that we can take our package on the next day FLOWERS and CAKE Of course you didnt refund it Today you took back to the post office my amazon package and didnt leave any note Ive found it out online without the address of the post office
In my opinion the only way to avoid such problems is to use another company for ex Hermes  Thank you
My order was not fully fulfilled I had an item that was not delivered with the rest of my order Sent all informations requested in hope of solving the problem and called several time and got some rude condescending arrogant representatives on the phone Requested a full refund and was told in one appalling solutions to call my bank and request a refund from them or have the same item sent to me after a month for 150 less Note that I dont want that item anymore given all the time and disappointment that Ive experienced At this point I hope for a full credit for that item or at least a store credit I hope we will come to a resolution without legal actions

Traveling with a baby is always tough its even more tough when you need to do more stopovers then the ones you thought you would do This is what happened to us when we booked our return flight from Amsterdam to Melbourne it appeared we would only do one stopover We were wrong We had to leave on Bali take all our bags with us get in a different plane to Indonesia take all our bags again and board in the last plane to Melbourne If we knew this it would be ok but we didnt We would easily buy a different ticket if only we knew  well this brings me to a simple User Interface change  add feedback on these specific flights Hopefully you can add it to the backlog of features to build All the best

I used this for a car rental and had no problems but then booking a further trip to Ireland from London I was charged on my CC in SEK no idea why the website Quote d GBP all the way through I contacted customer service who said I could cancel thus getting another overseas charge for the reversal or to wait until booking is completed and then to start a claim To be honest for me it is not worth it for the money involved but I am guessing that for others and higher charged it may be a problem so keep this in mind when booking with them

I booked a stay with them in Cambridge Massachusetts Its a real site However the host I stayed with was seriously frightening despite the fact that he had positive reviews He posted a picture on his website of himself with his wife implying he had a family but repeatedly talked about his divorce while I was visiting and behaved threateningly towards my wife She asked me not to leave a bad review for him as he had some personal information but I eventually decided I should leave one The host replied on the site by calling my wife a prostitute and posting where I worked unfortunately I had told him and literally threatening to come and assault me at work I contacted homestaycom about this and their response was to remove my review I guess that explains why they have terribly hosts with positive reviews Definitely dont trust any reviews from guests on this forum they dont care
I am not happy at all with DHgate policies they look after there sellers more than there buying customers I ordered an item and not received it When I finally contacted the seller had no response at all Then finally after several attempts DHgate intervened They where no help at all all they kept repeating to track item My response was yes I have tracked the item and as far as the mail service is concerned it was delivered But I have not received the item what can we do
The seller offered a refund of 001 This I found very insulting So I opened a dispute This went on for a few weeks and was very very frustrating All DHgate would say was to track item with no intervention with seller at all
Today I received an email from DHgate that it has been resolved Ha Ha Ha I have not received a refund or the item in questionso how on earth has this been resolved If you order from DHgate my advice is order at your own risk and pray you receive your item if not kiss your money good by

Hello
Ive used Marvin a lot for delivery from various restaurants dating back quite a while Time and time again Ive found myself having to contact the customer support staff online to get help with the Marvin website
Regular problems with the website consist of
 problems with the website not recognising or saving my address properly no matter how often I correct it and despite having had orders successfully delivered on a previous date A very simple solution would be to change the address line to have people input their Eircode assuming you also get your mapping on your website corrected 
 the website losing restaurants which were available to deliver to my address then suddenly are not despite me having earned loyalty credits from them and being able to get them to deliver if I order directly from them rather than via Marvinie Sometimes the staff on the online chat can reinstate the restaurants while I wait other times they cannot but the restaurants mysteriously reappear on my list of options a few days later
The website is unreliable and while the customer service team who work the online chat feature are very good and clearly do all they can to deal with the ongoing issues theres a limit to what they can do when the technology simply lets them down
Ive also asked the people on the live chat on more than one occasion to have a more senior staff member at Marvin call me the next day to speak about the problem but no one ever calls me 
Every time I try the service and get a successful experience it gives me a little confidence to stick with Marvin in the hope that perhaps theyve finally fixed their dodgy website but then a couple of orders later and were back to the same old problems At this stage I think one more website problem is all its going to take for me to close my Marvin account
Coincidentely I used the service last night having not used it for a few weeks and the website worked fine  however having been led to believe that the delivery would take something like 30 or 35 minutes it turned up after around 70 minutes There was no phone call to explain that they were going to be delayed and no apology when they did finally arrive I guess the driver was worn out having had to drive a little under 2 miles to bring me my food 
The Marvin website should show the time for delivery before a customer is compelled to pay so that the customer then has the option not to proceed if the delivery period is too long Also there should be an automatic 50 cash refund applied for the customer when the restaurant is more than 15 minutes later than the time indicated for delivery that might get the restaurants to shape up a bit 
For the record I dont live on Mars or in the most remote part of Ireland I actually live about 67 miles from Dublins GPO in a house in a culdesac that was constructed over 35 years ago so can easily be found on various maps etc
Needless to say Im happy to stand over all that Ive said here and your customer records should support all that Ive said

Friendly efficient staff car clean and ready to go and parked in a convenient position so the walk with luggage was quite short that is no more than two minutes
the person who bought the goods stole my card details the card used was not registered to the address you sent the goods to your clearly a shoddy company as despite me emailing you several times you still charged the card and despatched the goods
Bought a 4K TV and my credit card got charged 2 days later got an email saying that the price was not right I used to buy online in RC Willie They didnt honor their price mistake They return my money days laterr but after this RCWillie is not a trustworthy company Sad
Buying something online should not have to include waiting a lengthy time to pick it up You drive sales to get people in the door I despise waiting in line so I will never plan on buying furniture from you
Thank you so very much  I start radiation this week and I needed a sleeve you had it to me much earlier then I thought Thank you again Love the sleeve and gauntlet 
Received an item that was not working Its not the 1st time this has happen to me thats the sad part
This company is not trustworthy dont ever trust this company base on my experience just today February 14 2017my order number 01709566
The apr is extremely high and they require too much of a down payment up front I can tell that Shannon was only about the sell because she acted as if coming to th train station was too much for her to do She lied and said well I got another person coming and I was there for awhile and no one ever showed up She also told me that she would wash my car and fill it up My car definitely was NOT washed and it was extremely dirty in the inside She only fil the tank up half way so she lied about that to The customer service part can definitely be improved
Ordered contacts on 210 and as of 222 I still have not received them I would like to know how your company compensates a long standing customer when a situation like this arises
their payment processing service will often result in two days of no updates and then your order will be abruptly canceled This is especially frustrating because of the delays it causes All it would take for potv to fix this is to contact their customers before canceling orders like many other similar companies already do

Outrageous having bills of 100 gas for one bedroom apartment Not ok
Wrong phone sent to me Difference of 30 Still waiting for new phone to arrive Slow service although once emailed generic email sent backwe are sorry etc will never buy on line from them again
I would give no star if I had the choice Appalling customer service all around I had a nightmare to retrieve vouchers I paid for when I phoned them I was told they couldnt help and that they have no customer complaint service how convenient I certainly wouldnt recommend it to anyone
My self and my partner have just left the Norwich showroom and we are absolutely shocked at how they are aloud to treat people
At the weekend we had a look around the show room and found a car we liked but we mentioned that we would have preferred it in black At this point the salesman told us they had the exact same car in black at an other branch We agreed to pay 250 to have the car transported  reserved and brought over to our local branch
We went in tonight to have a look at the car and although it wasnt the exact same trim level and spec as the one we had previously seen we were quite happy with the car We said to the sales adviser that we were going to go home have a chat and get our finances ready to go We were then told that we had to decide if we wanted the car there and then we were told if we left the show room the reserve would be removed and we would loose our transportation fee
We spoke to the manager who just kept asking us why we could not make the decision here and now He was generally rude patronising and came across very pushy When i said that we were not toldmade aware we had to make a commitment on viewing the car and taking for a test drive the manager told me that it was my word against the salesmans
The pressure the manager put us under with the threat of loosing our reservation money has really upset my girl friend and I
We will be contacting the industry regulates to get our money back
To sum it all up drive time is just a rip offThey know people come with bad credit and they use it to their advantage selling cars that are not worth the money They rig them up to last a few days after you buy them and then all kinds of problems arise NEVER again will I do business with them or advise anyone else toLesson learned People fix your credit as im trying to do so you wont have to deal with rip offs like this
I have called twice to have it resent I recieved this survey and offers for hotel stay Still no itinerary
After years of using and dont get me wrong I LOVE Groupon as we are living on a fixed income the discounts have NEVER applied to any offer I have tried to buy
Buying from ssense is knowing we are not buying feak stuffs
Two keys work two keys dont The numbers coincide with the lock but they just dont work
They blocked my account They kept my money for months When I wrote to them they did not answer my questions They were totally useless Dont even consider using them
I bought a bed under missleading information from a sales associate and now have to be inconvenienced because I had to return the bed and wait for a refund which I was told I would get a FULL refund and am being took in circles because it was not noted in my file for me to get a full refund I am very displeased with gardner White as a whole
They take your information and then cancel the order just so they could send you a bunch of spammy email thereafter
Make your own opinion
I placed an order for an item on 321 2017 It took them until almost noon on 32420017 to inform me that they cannot fill my order on that specific cold air intake that it was no longer
available for my vehicle anymore As each day passed waiting in anticipation for my item to arrive only get to get the phone call 4 days later frustrated me
Their only solution was to sell me a more expensive cold air intake with a 20 discount witch i would have gotten on my own through a promo code had i ordered the other intake then thay mentioned free shipping witch you get
S what was my compensation for my disappointment and my inconvenience What was supposed to be shipped to my house within 2 to 3 business days which would have been Wednesday 22nd or Thursday 23rd now I wont see until the following week or as they say two to three business days which would be next Tuesday 28th or Wednesday 29th if it was my company I would have apologized profusely for my error and I would make sure that the customer satisfied and happy and if it meant eating the cost of overnight shipping or giving the customer the other product for the price he or she paid for the first one thats just good business as I said in the beginning make your own opinion As for me I only give one chance at earning my trust in good business As I share my story with my friends it will not be a good review therefore Ill try alternative companies in ordering in the future

Ordered a LeEco phone had to wait for 6 weeks To my surprise the phone has problems with quality and some important features are not working or stopped working within first 4 days No telephone number to contact the customer service they can be contacted only by email Coolicool is not ready to refund my money they are offering a free repair which I am not in agreement
Overall I DO NOT recommend to purchase anything Buy something from local store or local online store where refunds are provided without any questions
Product was suppose to ship within 24 hours 2 weeks later nothing Still dont even have a tracking number Item was promised to me over a week ago
Not shown as in picture didnt come with clip to hold away from manifold ruined cable and parts gerk wouldnt do anything about it
Bonprix had problems before but now at its large They lost track of the returnable goods and did not pay back instead the customer service acted irresponsible Many documents provided on returnable goods but never saw single Swedish company ever lost their returned products Compared services provided by Lindex Kappahl and HM this is a cheat company They should be banned from the market Customers be aware
Great website flowers delivered when expected Theyre the good points I certainly didnt expect them to arrive in a box Look nothing like the photo on the website  described as Glorious on the website but far from it Free chocolate box is tiny I wish Id stuck to my original plan and bought a beautiful Mothers Day bouquet for less money at Marks and Spencer In fact I will probably go and buy some from MS because I dont want my mum to be disappointed I am extremely disappointed Would not recommend Not good value for money Never again You have been warned
On the 24 february I placed an order for some item for my mobilephone Order No 1702241021716149

Stay away from this company

Every time I get on this website it does not run smoothly Takes a lot of time loading and scrolling pauses quite often or freezes up all together giving me no other option but to start over on previous page
I would have rated them negative if given an option when i reached the redemption level they stopped sending any more activities and their reward link dont work i have complained a nmber of times but they never reply
Sent out my item two weeks after it was scheduled and only did once I had asked them to
The speaker rainbow was not as expected
The bluetooth does not work and quality is so bad
I ordered a screen protector and a phone case The screen protector arrived broken and the phone case has yet to arrive ordered about 2weeks ago Very disappointed
Ive made an order on 1st Februarypaying 4 euros for an express delivery4872 but the order was dispatched 3 weeks later Definitely not recommended
Useful but allows companies to whitewash their reputations by flagging reviews they dont like and then leaving comments which customers cannot respond to on negative reviews The averages should therefore be taken as an absolute best case as the negative ones are censored
I have done business with Groupon for quite a while and have been completely pleased However this last order was not so good Groupon doubled my order and charged for the doubled items When I tried to email them to get it straightened out I found that there is no way to reach them Their website has a place to hit to get help but it does not work I wasted a long time trying to find alternatives to no avail I am so disgusted with Groupon that when a friend said to check Google for a phone number which I did that I just decided I did not want to deal with them at this point Having issues dealt with should not be hard to handle
brilliant idea on the outset but my first experience was dreadful A small moving job I listed was Quote d and assigned and then cancelled at the request of the tasker for reasons either untrue or not given TWICE OVER The task was finally fulfilled after much carry on and whilst I agreed under duress due to the now immanent move to the inflated fee I felt that I didnt get value for money Simply not worth the hassle will not use Airtasker again for my own tasks but will gladly pick up tasks up as I know I can do better than the service I received

Was so dissappointed as I ordered a tracksuit for my nephews birthday and got it delivered in store  the pants only arrived and I wasnt told on collection then when I got home I realised it and had to ring they said they would look into it f I sent photos by email eventually the following day after 24hours waiting I had to ring to be told the jacket was missing and I had to order a new tracksuit and wait again such a long ordeal
It was not the model expected and Despite all the documents I got when I give back the car with no problem at all which said all was paid and ok 0  due I have the bad surprise back to home to see on my account a 60 dollars more was taken Why Thats look like a fraud no
I Had a first generation flologic spent big money and after warranty expires the valve quits working the flow meter quits working no way to replace it no warranty so junk it is
My order was taking too long to arrive 10 days already so Ive contacted the company The contact said the package was lost but there would be a new delivery Two days after and still no news from my order I had to contact you again when I immediately received the confirmation that my order could be picked up at the store So hadnt I contacted you twice would my order never arrive
I was not happy that what I bought was not a suitable monitor in terms of connectivity for my laptop And while I received friendly support I have had to make two extra trips to your store to get alternative cables I met with considerable resistance when I wanted to return the product This tells me you dont really care about customer needs Even if I get this product working I wont be buying from you again
If the latest connectivity solution does not work I will not hesitate to ensure that you take the product backwhatever that means in terms of legal avenues
Ive paid for the policy the deductible and the refundable deposit for the loaner phone As soon as they had my money they went COMPLETELY GHOST Nobody emails me back Nobody picks up the phone The Live Chat is ALWAYS offline There is simply NO WAY to get in touch with anyone They have had my money for WEEKS and have provided NO SERVICE WHATSOEVER I have not even received the loaner phone  let alone the repairreplacement of my phone You cant even reference a single policy number  they give you separate numbers for the policy the claim and seemingly any action they take on your part which makes tracking this a nightmare as well TERRIBLE company
My claim was initiated on 13 Dec 2016 for loss and theft of my iPhone Deductible for the iPhone which is 286 and deductible for a loaner phone 99 were charged to my account Last time I spoke to Sean Hansen was sometime in December After leaving bunch of emails and calls I never heard back from Sean Then Angelo was my next contact with Essuranty He said he is going to take care of my claim and make sure everything is on track sometime around early January After that I made so many calls and emails to essuranty but never received any response I am very disappointed and frustrated If you cannot process my claim then return my money back

I filed a claim and expected contact within the 4  6 hour SLA thats promoted on the site I called two days later to be told all our claims and purchases are backed up We dont know when our system will be back up call us again Monday Given the issue is on GoCares side Id expect proactive and regular communication to those affected Poor customer experience especially given its for my sons school computer and theyll give him a loaner only through the end of this month
I have purchased coupons for years and only had one bad incident with a floral coupon I did not give two stars because of service from Groupon but because I am surprised that they would sell tickets to a circus with a reputation of animal abuse Considering Groupon promotes animal establishments I am surprised they would associate with that circus Therefore my conscious will not allow me to purchase anymore coupons
Awful experience I was Quote d 78613 for my rental and after I submitted payment suddenly the number became 101164 Cancelling immediately never using your service again
I had a problem with my baggage I have booked and paid my baggage to Edreams and it was not appearing on the airline company and it was very difficult to address the problem to the right person and to get things done I have sent several requests through the website explaining my problem and only after 3 or 4 requests I got an answer from Edreams that was not satisfactory and a phone number to call if not satisfied with the service When I called the number it took at least 10 min to get me through with someone that could help me
NECESITO URGENTE CAMBIAR LA FECHA DE MI VUELO Y LA PAG DE USTEDES NO ME LO PERMITE REF  4330571001  URGENTE 
This is the second time Ive been rip off from LYFTI OPT in for their guarantee rate at 23 34 45 I drove within those hours and when I look at the HISTORYthey had me down as starting at 1100 so that I would not qualify for the guarantee rate
My acceptance rate was 100 untill the next t the last ride which was about a little after 5 when I got some very nasty rude and very over rate customer got in my carthey begin to fight and start spraying my car with their perfume
So lyft is not paying me my guarantee rate that I earn within the time period and had an100  acceptance rate until the trouble riders got in my car and destroyed my back seat
I do not see LYFT and Uber in the future as they have many complaints while the CEO get rich cheating their drivers and others that work for them
Simplicity does NOT mean that you deliver an inferior product on purpose at full market price to customers who dont know any better That is not true simplicity Its dishonesty And the ways in which this test is inferior is not allowing people to achieve results or oftentimes leading them to false conclusions Not only is this bad for genealogical research it goes against the Genealogical Proof Standards that professional genealogists know theyre supposed to uphold
Problems from the beginning magnified by their new website which cannot even check an item is in stock handle a VAT number or complete a purchase order Had to leave my business country with this cloud over my head now 7 working days and they have debited my account twice and cannot even contact me about the status of our part I mean come on you are screwing up a lot of peoples livelihoods with your incompetence no excuses just get it done
Lousy return policy Got penalized 25 for returning a chair that did not match rest of dcor in living room Looked good in show room The tag is still on it Will not make that mistake again
Salesperson was good though
I purchase some ski pants they where to be sent 2nd day for out ski trip store never sent them
Please make sure you double check with them the UPS tracking number
It took 34 phone calls plus emails to get my order right At first the order did not ship at all then only one of two products in the order shipped Each time there was a delay in getting it right Most likely I will not order from your company again
The Shipping Sucks
Though I purchased it more than 3000 dollars products arrived after nearly two months passed
I had contacted their customer service for guidance on a brake caliper repair kit They had ATE kits labeled Front Rear Rear Left  Rear Right The Rear kit from ATE was more expensive by a few dollars than the ATE kits labeled Rear Right or Rear Left That seems to naturally imply that the Rear Left or Right kit included parts for one corner and that the ATE kit labeled just Rear included parts for both corners in the rear I know better than to make assumptions though even fairly obvious ones I contacted customer service to make sure that the kit I wanted to order would include parts for both sides I received a reply saying that it did and I placed my order The kit arrivedand only parts for 1 side were in the box Son of aokayIll call customer service and surely they will take care of this problem The customer service rep I spoke to didnt listen to a word I said He asked me this whole long line of seemingly irrelevant questions until finally it became clear that he hadnt bothered to listen to what the problem was When I explained again the problem he told me that he couldnt help me but he would have a supervisor call me back in about an hour No call ever came I submitted an online request and the next day I received a reply I ended up having to go write to them wait for a reply and repeat a total of 4 times The end result of all of this was being treated like an idiot lied to told that the CS reply telling me that the kits covered both side was meaningless I wasnt offered a single method to resolve the problem not even just a return I was treated like a liar  a thief for threatening to have to go through the chargeback process with my credit card company if they wouldnt do anything It was incredible horrible absurd insulting baffling pathetic and it was the last time I will deal with Parts Geek If they had any decency or common sense they would have changed the way they list the products on their website if they indeed intend it to be a kit for a single side and they would have shipped me off a kit to cover the other side as their CS rep had indicated I would receive to begin with Were talking about 8 small rubber rings that probably cost them 510 at most and for the cost of those rings they could have purchased a loyal customer instead of creating a really upset customer Not to mention the fact that it was just the right thing to do I mean seriously Their listings were explained horribly if they intended it to be a for a single side and their own CS rep told it was for both sides If that rep was wrong then fine but that isnt my fault or problem I was offered a product for a price and I accepted the deal I received a product that is not the one I agreed to purchase That is the definition of chargeback merchandise not as described but yet I was threatening them when I asked them to find a solution to this problem
The reply from Parts Geek is a flat out lie and Im not going to let a flat out lie stand without a response It amazes me though that they would go to such lengths to provide such horrible customer service instead of just owning up to their mistake and fixing it I am an experienced mechanic not some novice without any sense of right or wrong trying to just steal a part from them or cover up a mistake That is exactly how they tried to make me feel though in their correspondence and that I appreciated less than anything else All it required was for them to actually spend 30 seconds reading their own CSRs response I originally inquired about the centric kit so that much is true at least What the reply from Parts Geek does not bother to mention is that the message Parts Geek sent me about the Centric brand kit did not just answer my question about the Centric kit The customer service rep provided a response about the entire category of parts as a whole regardless of brand Later I discovered that the kit I was initially intending on ordering would not work for my car The Centric brand seals are apparently about 5 mm too small in diameter and they dont sit properly As a result I ordered a kit from a different manufacturer ATE I made this order based on the information provided in the response to my initial inquiry Please get this through your head Parts Geek I inquired about Centric but the CSR provided an answer about all of the brands for caliper repair kits As a result I saw no need to send an additional inquiry to receive information that I had already been given Add to that the way the listings are provided and I beg for you to please tell me how someone should not expect that parts kit to include pieces for both sides You still havent fixed that yet by the way I checked Rear Left  Rear Right have the same part number and price Rear has a different part number  is more expensive Dont you think that alone kind of implies that you can either purchase them separately or together as a kit for both sides This is not a conversation that I had any desire to continue but if youre going to post lies about me Ill be glad to respond
I am sort of new to buying from china I have been using Hobbykingcom for 15 years without problems I have also used dealextreme in the past no problems In December 2016 I ordered from banggood gearbest and tomtop all in the same week I am not a picky person just get me my items I paid for and work decently Banggood and Gearbest took 36 weeks to get me all of my items I luckily only ordered one item from tomtop and it has yet to even be shipped I have sent two dozen emails not one response I sent an email every day for two weeks no response I am now disputing with paypal DONT USE TOMTOP
Delivery delayed 12 days and at arrival a piece was missing Was asked if I wanted a small refund or to send the thing back and get a new one As I did not want to spend more time with this I chose refound Turned out that  refound is placed with them to buy Not god enough
Worst experience ever with a company So far they have double charged me 1785 and refused to help out with refusing it they keep blaming the bank I used a travel credit card to pay initially and they declined the payment and asked me to pay via paypal At the time they assured me that the pending transaction on the credit card wouldnt go through and it has Total criminals Never use and this needs to be escalated because as far as Im concerned this is fraud accepting the payment to get double the amount
I signed up with YEXT and after two weeks of trying it decided it wasnt worth the price tag YEXT says im out of luck and have to stay with them for a year spending nearly 2000 on a service i dont want and dont need
Stay away from YEXT
bought a product that they said I could not return because it was cut to size However the website states clearly that they have an easy return policy Not so they refused to give me a refund for a 60 item Poor customer relations
Really Poor experience with Goway Travel We were group of 1618 people our reservations werent confirmed under group in any of the hotels and excursions Many times checked out of hotel by 500 am took the flight and at the destination by 1000 am and find out our hotel rooms not available till 300 pm Hotels have no information to deal with our group at 1000 am Misleading Hotel details Upgraded to 4 star hotels and none of the 9 hotels were 4 star
Dates and timings were wrong on iternaries So much confusion We were on the phones everyday to confirm our reservations for excursions and transportations Few people were taken to wrong hotels were booked on different tours from rest of the group Horrible experience Will never take goway Travels again Half the people have to ask for discount their representative advised Really really poor Representative Beware Goway
Ordered a tshirt under the impression that it could be delivered in 24 hours for an impending bday trip abroad and I had to chase at 4pm to hear that the tshirt had been damaged in production and now would be late and missing the deadline
Not good enough at all
Now seeking refund
Just find another one of these companies theres loads more and these arent very good anyway the designer element is very poor Give yourself more time and find one that delivers in 35 working days
i was happy when i get a extra holiday week from work
but i was dissapointed by my travelagent who offered me a more expensive return ticket than my original one  no help at all
When I went to confirm it timed out and then kept saying the flights have gone and increased by 200
Worst experience ever not at all pleased with whole mess Sent me to storage nearly 12 miles from my home were not helpful at all
We love the convenience of the ordering system and the efficiency of the shipping Any light bulb need can be met at this one site
I could NOT complete my buy the machine would not let me put in my pin or change my charge Then it would not let me put in my savings
code It was just dead Could not buy
I found Rentokil to be milking its name and reputation within the market Yes they surveyed the property and confirmed we had rat and mice droppings yes they set traps  poison which you can buy in the hardware store for 2 yes they came and checked however they didnt spot the hole through which they were most likely entering After three week of checks and one mouse found that was it i never heard from them again I had to do all the work myself when the rats reappeared Get down and dirty find the entrance points block them up a relatively simple job after being convinced they must be getting through a cracked sewer pipe and you will need a camera survey  Oh and by the way and extra 300 or so and oh now you need a rat flap 600  no way i sourced and fitted it myself for a fraction of the price A rip off company if ever there was one  I have learned my lesson as always just try it yourself or an alternative competitor  I thought for a neat fee as a major landlord i could have the problem solved in one visit  Well you live and learn  Thank you Rentokil 
I preordered mass effect for PS4 they tried to take the money outta my account 3 times in one day then said they couldnt and cancelled my order I was getting the game for 38 with all dlc  then because my preorder got cancelled they wanted me to pay 44  So in a result of this I went to amazon and got it for 40 with all the DLC these were offering so they lost custom
Im not one to ever give bad feedback but unfortunately now I am Although we enjoyed HelloFresh meals its been a horrible customer service and support nightmare Not to mention that I referred your company after getting our first box with only one major delivery issue We were very satisfied with the meals although it would be great to offer a plan for a family of 6 we do still exists
The major issues with the company comes from referal offerings of refering friends and family for a Free First boxes of 3 meals for 2 people and HELLOFRESH cant manage the offer and get it delivered to the address of choice to ensure safe delivery My daughter wanted to try this offer and the company refused to send it to our house to help her out because she lives in an apartment and was worried about trying to get the box due to the office hours dont work for her work schedule so because they wouldnt let her have it delivered to our address so we could get it and take it to her My daughter had to ask her job to let her get off early to get the box only to find out they still didnt send it to her a second time Then they said they fixed the issue and shed be getting her box a few days later only no box and they charged her credit card without any notice for a Free box she never got and then told her it was for the meal coming this week She said she had never got the first box and they clearly could see that Horrible experience with the customer service personnel and I hate referring friends and family only to create a nightmare of phone calls and delivery issues and unauthorized charges I suggest until HELLOFRESH can seriously get a grip on thier CS department and fix all these issues Id have to say FIND ANOTHER DELIVERY SERVICE
I enjoy using Dior skincare but this time I bough Dior Snow skin care and It make my skin breakout red and irritated use one time If you have an allergies to Fish product you should not used Dior Snow skin care line I told the beauty consultant that I have sensitive skin and she said I can still used it it made for sensitive skin peoples I guess not since I when to Macy and ask and the other beauty consultant said that lady was wrong for saying that to me From now on I stick to my Dreamskin it never led me down
The worst part about ordering Dior directly online is that I have to pay for shipping to return it It cost me more money out of my pocket and hassle than what it worth From now on Im going to buy Dior at Macy instead At least they have free return hassle free
Ordered a deskDelivered in a box that looked like it was in a bad car wreck
Product did not fit my car contacted customer support and they tried to push blame to the wrong manufacturer Stopped getting responses after I asked for a solution
Web price better than app price for the same car Why
Stop spam mails
I booked a one way for a friend on 25 March I immediately received an SMS from the bank informing me that my account had been debited A few hours letter I was informed that that the booking was cancelled because my card failed a security check They went on to say No charge has actually been made to your account How ridiculous is that statement when I have my bank statement in front of me and money has been debited out of my account
I called the call center and the agent informed me that they have already refunded me and I will receive the payment within 24 hrs I requested for a confirmation email so I could chase the refund with my bank and again I was told I will receive the email within 24 hoursTwo days later I have received no email or refund
We had to cancel the trip because we had no other funds to book that trip Now we can only make other arrangement when lastminute finally refund us if they will ever do Its very annoying that we now have to work with your timelines with absolute uncertainty about when the trip will happen
The dress I ordered looked amazing in the picture on the model who looked about my size height etc The dress was too big in the chest and way too short the model was said to be 59 in the photo which is my same height The dress was over an inch off the ground around my ankles Based off the sizing chart and length of the dress described in the photos Im scared to order off here again Dresses should be made longer Shorter girls can get dresses hemmed but taller girls are just out of luck
Over all service was good although I felt there was a pressure to add work on As title states initial outlay for service was low however over all cost seemed high
I was so excited to buy this product but even after following every step the product is of very very poor quality Unable to rub off marking easily Its hard to clean the board I regret not sticking to the standard mountable whiteboards
They are trying to charge a 4400 excess for damage that was there on pick up
PLease note that their orders are tentative orders They take your ORDER and keep you updated and see if they can fill it Placing your order on this site does not mean that you should stop looking elsewhere for the same product
Kind of like  we will send you an email alert if your item becomes available we can fill it
Spoke to a couple of people today  no clue of what was happening No manager around either After 30 minutes a self proclaimed manager comes on the phone More like a shreiky high schooler No clue customer service skills Stay away from this site Service is not good
Do not buy from them they acept orders confirm them and the cancel them Absolutely untrustable
I bought a tennis bracelet for my wife on Valentines Day To my chagrin when it showed up in the mail the svarovski stones were 2mm The picture used by Groupon to sell me looked like a normal size tennis bracelet Very disappointed
Maybe my perception was wrong who knows Terrible experience though I placed an order at 836 am for same day delivery by 4pm no problem purchasing the order at all I went ahead upgraded to the premium flower arrangement pre determined online what I wanted but upgraded since there is so much pride on client experience Initial guy amazing but no follow through I was told I would receive my confirmation number etc never got I go through the website and find a trackin of my order at 230 when I never received a message from my girlfriend excited for her flowers So I check I status update I then call in at 235 garubtee they show up by 400 pm GARUBTEE Thats great my girlfriend get off a little after 4 Well at 422 I call back and they where not delivered yet While on the phone I get the confirmation email the number and a delivery time of 418 after being on the phone for 12 minutes So I talk to the lady on the phone about it and they offer 10 off my next purchase I told them I would never use them again I asked for my invoice and what I was charged for delivery of same day before 4 pm and she says okay I can give 10 off the next orders okay mind each arrangement is 100 simple Matt 10 either way so again I ask for invoice and total I paid for delivery Wont give an answer had to pry it out m I asked for a refund in my delivery fee then Offer 995 when the arrangement delivery was close to 20 as far as Im concerned from an 84 arrangement to 107 so I ask for a manager non available and she is the best to speak with Again I ask for a manager Im furious Ill hold until ones available to finally get 1395 refund for all of this
price is high 
You should give this furniture away for all the hassle I had to endure I had to go pick up what was left after spending lots of money No way will o refer this company
I spent a lot of time with a sales person from carID figuring out exactly what type of front license plate frame would fit my cars front bumper Waited 6 days for it to show up It was the WRONG product and would not fit my bumper When I called to return it  I found out that I WOULD NOT RECEIVE A FULL REFUND They would take the shipping charges and then some So my 32 cost was only credited 19 All because their expert sales person who spent so much time with me STILL couldnt sent me the correct part That should not be my problem or expense Do not buy or trust anyone from carID It will cost you
Yes they offer a cheap price but watch out for the changing total when you check out Plus they charge fees when you use a credit card or PayPal and it just appears in your total Watch out
Avas Flowers is simply not trustworthy I placed a telephone order for flowers for 5999 but my credit card was charged 9790 There were added charges for same day delivery greeting card ribbon etc which were not discussed on the phone Totally misleading Customer service was polite but unaccommodating Dont use Avas Use your local florist instead Beware of calling an 800 number for flowers Avas order  4074016

I attempted to order a drone from Beach Camera 2 seperate times After 2 shipping dates were missed and a fake tracking label was sent to my email At that point I had to get Google trusted stores involved Google trusted stores handled the situation very professionally cancelled my order and refunded me the money I ended up having to go directly to the manufacturer for my purchase and received a way better deal than Beach camera offered
This was my first and will be my only order from Beach Camera

After ordering this radiator it took 14 days for it to arrive When I complained I was told that a faster shipping was not available Lets see you car be broke down for that time and see how you would rate the experience
I like Groupon for the fun items and services they offer at a discount but buyer beware The items are often of poor quality and not usually American made product The supposed discount isnt always really a discount I booked a Grand Canyon tour through Groupon where the regular price was allegedly 17999 per person and they said I was getting a great deal at 94 per person After I purchased 2 tour packages through Groupon I went on the company website to find that they were actually offering the exact same tour for 72 Neither the company or Groupon would honor that price So I could have saved an additional 44 had I booked directly through the company
WARNING to all I understand geekparts have cheap auto parts but what you dont know is that if the part arrives damaged or if you need to return it you will not get all of your money spent back in fact you have to pay for the shipping out of pocket and the money received back will be less than what you paid and the address that shows on the website leads to know where Its always the same guy ingredients picking up the phone and if you have a problem and you submit a ticket he can block you so your tickets wont work This is not a creditable company its some guy working out of his houes
I ordered a hob online and have had no correspondence as to where it is how long its going to take an apology for the delay or anyone to tell me anything
Thanks

Paid 70 euros for 20 days and there is nothing 
Way too big for my face and there was no way to tell how big when I ordered them
After received a damaged product and it is not working as described i called for a refund or a product return
Neither of them were allowed and after 2 months im still awaiting for my money back
Even the product ratings are a fraud I submitted a bad review and they didnt approve it For 100 sales there are only 3 5star reviews Theyre hiding all bad reviews
Order No 01710220
Ordered flowers on 3rd Feb  payment taken on 6th Feb  delivery date 8th Feb no flowers no contact from company
Online chat not much help I called the overseas number at 2200 and was told the goods I had paid for were not available But would send other flowers on 9th Feb
10th Feb flowers arrived  a poor replacement for what was ordered
Wont use these people ever again 
They give the keys no one comes with you to find the car in 1C freezing cold outside No one comes with you to explain the car and the GPS was in German no English  we paid a lot more for the GPS with no use truthfully a Bad Experience
Second leg of a two leg flight cancelled I have been unable to contact them by phone for the last 10 hours The phone system takes you through the menu options and then cuts you off On the website the next available flight Amsterdam to Vienna has a 400 euro charge Delays and cancellations happen but its how a company deals with it that tells you what its like Very poor experience so far
If you want every dealership in the vicinity of your home to harangue you indefinitely using the contact info provided to them by TrueCar this is the site for you Even after we refused to give our phone number to dealers when they emailed us they crossindexed somehow or got info from TrueCar and got our home and cell numbers and called us both persistently Angies List was recently caught out for taking finders fees from contractors that appears to be whats going on here Of the dealers who emailed offers the majority said to be provided by dealer or something similar rather than quoting actual figures or discounts
I wish I had checked the reviews I recently ordered something and the quality was poor and did not fit as stated I received and RMA  as instructed and return the order and it has been delivered for more than their allotted 1015 days and no one will now respond to any emails that I send They will not answer the phone You stay on hold for over 30 minutes then a recording comes on and say due to high call volume you will be disconnected Sucks Will never order again if I get the store credit they promised since they do no do refunds
Dear Sofia
You reported my previous review because I reposted I have every right to ask if it is a scam You said the flights were confirmed at 10 pm on day of booking yet to date no confirmations have been sent You told me to contact you if emails were not sent to the recipients Which I did and received no response
Dont buy ticket here
It was an offer of Level by Iberia with tickets at very good price everybody was buying it very quickly I buy my ticket from them and suddenly I realize that their system changed my returning date automatically to one week after arrive instead 28 days as I booked on a 12 hours travel to other continent
I call them the costumer service was very unfriendly and awful finally they dont give me any solution just refund my money I lost the offer because their fault
and it also happen to other people who wanted to buy the deal there are message on social medias about this situation
I never more will use this company and I dont recommend them
I have spent the whole day trying to contact your team at mascot in Sydney and not a single person has picked up 1000 was charged to my card and has not been returned despite your staff telling me that everything was good when I returned the car I was not prewarned that I would need to put his money down in the first place until I arrived to pick up my car now I am left in a mad scramble to pay bills because it has not been returned This lack of service is not good enough
I canceled my acct over 5 months ago and still be charged
SAS latest marketing of cheap seats is complete BS Now they are no better than RyanAir or EasyJet with misleading pricing
1160 KR just to take 2 bags on vacation when we are buying 5 return seats unbelievable rip off
Since I followed to customer reprenstive from las 4 day they make me on hold for 30 minutes its worse than ever
The outfits said the Intro Offer was 15 and then 25 for the Outfit  however when I added the outfits to my cart they were 59 through checkout So I abandoned the checkout process for those outfits
I found it difficult to get through to them they tell you they will call you back but it was two days before I got a call from them imagine if you wanted to transfer your insurance onto another car would not recommend them
Complete lack of communication
I started my order on March 3rd and honestly Ive been trying to push through a terrible design experience for the reward of a good price on a product Im satisfied with
I dont know if Ill ever get there
After 2 weeks of 1 edit every 2 daysvery basic thingscenter the logo move the background out of the logo Basic easy things that should have all been the starting point of a coin design but werent
After the 5th edit and the second week I just took their mockup into photoshop and designed the coin myself
Then I asked them to put a brushed metal effect on the background I uploaded one of their own coins with this effect as an example
So then I get an edit back just showing that example coin  
I have to write to my design coordinator and he says Theyre still using your design just adding that brass finish you want
I tell him I dont want a brass finishI want brushed metal
The edit came back with my logo which is fine and the brushed metal effect which is great
But now the coin is listed as brushed brass not silver with a brushed brass background effect and the finishes are listed as brushed brass and antique silver
I wrote back to them on March 11th saying to remove the brass information that no brass is wanted just the brushed metal effect
And thats it No new edits no communication since March 11th
I wrote to Chris Clark my Design Coordinator 2 work days ago and no response either
Ive wasted an entire month on this process
I feel like this is a fake company who spends a little bit of time moving around logos and then abandoning orders pocketing the rest
I had to pay 5020 Euro for tax
I ordered fireproof curtains for my restaurant and was promised a certification of fireproofing I received curtains which are mediocre but no certificationit took 2 phone calls and a chat to get a certification emailed to me and when I received it it was only halfit refers to a reverse side but only received one page What I did receive only guarantees fireproofing for one yearvery disappointed
Very professional attentive and very courteous Im very satisfied with all of purchases and delivery
I would recommend my salesman and this storeTaylor to everyone I know
I received the hardback book and due to the book not being protected and mailed in a flimsy envelope it was badly damaged on the top in the middle of the book causing damage on all pages
I have spent the last 2 weeks messing about with this company trying to get my branded hoodie ready and they have been doing bits and pieces each day after taking my money for the hoodie as I wouldnt pay extra for them to do the embroidery until I knew it was correct how I wanted it as they wanted me to pay upfront and then get told that if any editing needs to be done on it after embroidery has been done I NEED TO PAY FOR IT Are they kidding I have paid for a hoodie and design and embroidery to be done and if they dont do it right I have to then pay extra to fix it They also said they wouldnt prioritise getting my order done as I didnt pay for express shipping I done standard shipping which is up to 6 days not 2 weeks later with still no final design no hoodie and outrageous customer service
Refund requested and waiting to see how long that takes if at all before another complaint goes in
I took advantage of the 30 free bet promo code I win some money and decide to withdraw my original deposit but Paddypower lock my account for no reason and want ALL personal identification with a photo of me holding them like a 419 scam with customer service just repeating This was a decision taken by the security team over and over Until they disconnected cant add the screenshot after
Cant dispute these with Paypal either
Will never use this company again

Hi
Today I received this Product and I would say confidently that it is a fake product I gone through the artical written by lenskart Only Site http articleslenskartcom doyouownafakeraybanhtml and found this lines The inner part of the right temple arm of an original RayBan pair features a style name followed by the name of the country of manufacture along with the letters CE which stand for European Conformity The letters font alignment spacing and the positioning of the characters should be examined carefully
But when I Checked the product Received only Ray Ban is written over there
Also the temples are very tight and fonts and alignment is not looking originalAlso the box says manufactured by Ray ban sun optical India when I searched for the company I didnt found found any authentic Quote s or website
I also checked with the local authorised retailers they also confirmed that it was a fake product
I suggest to not buy any product from lenskart Better invest some more money and buy from authentic site or store

I ordered a gift voucher for a family members birthday When I went to print the voucher it had the price listed on it and didnt have the greeting I requested After speaking to their Live Chat agent and then calling a manager at the call centre they advised this was a known issue they were unable to fix it and I was not allowed to remove the price from the voucher As this is a gift this is unacceptable To make matters worse the manager said the advice the Live Agent gave me was incorrect
 If this is a known issue why is still available on the website
 Why is incorrect information being given by agents
Good site overall but be careful when booking They check options for you that you have to uncheck otherwise they will charge you extra eg insurance and seat selection I was fortunately able to cancel the insurance but not the seat selection
The rental cars app by default charges you full insurance cover by default when most personal or credit card insurance covers this This type of scam underlines the belief that the rental car industry is unethical and a insurance rip off
When i comolained the telenagent was helpful and removed the charge but how many people dont notice and lose a large amonut of money 45 perday
You have put my name as Brian Ridley Margaret Ruth on the booking form ref855262 It should be Brian Ridley Hopkinson Please correct it
We placed an order 8 months ago DPS delivered us the wrong parts We send them back accordingly and they only gave us store credit Since we had bad experience with them before we are reluctant to buy any longer Director of the company Valerie Fisera promised via chat to refund on our bank account We have been waiting for 6 months now They do not reply any longer to any message sent by chat phone or even after a registered letter by post
Furthermore one paid order is still not delivered for more then 1 year
We keep hope all problems will be solved soon and we will keep you updated
I booked a rental car with ace through rental cars com because they promised the car would be ready at the airport Instead the car is on an off site lot To find it Ive now incurred 20 in long distance fees and have to wait for 45 minutes for some guy to come pick me up and take me to this unknown location I PAID MORE BECAUSE RENTALCARS com said the car is AT THE AIRPORT I did so because I have a very tight schedule I will be persueing reimbursement
stay well away there is always an extra cost after cost and Im never able to update my website because of server problems
Delivery good and smooth What really disappointed was having to purchase a returns label to send the goods back
Booked in advance for a cost of 750 on what was considered a good deal Downloaded all paperwork from DVLA as requested and had two forms of identity Drove the 35 miles to pickup the booked vehicle only to be informed that I required two official documents with my address on it but my driving licence would not count Paid 350 for my address to be confirmed by Car Hire labs Next I was told my deal was only third party insurance and if I wanted fully comprehensive it would be triple what the car hire was When saying no thank you I was told that my access would therefore be 1300 which had to be blocked on my card up front At this point I declined the rental leaving without my much needed hire 10 out of pocket and wasting 2 hours of my time
Do not book your hotel via Amoma Perhaps they are cheaper but wenn you have to cancel your reservation done in March for August in my case within one day after some hours because of personal reasons they can only explain you their cancellation policy and let you pay Normal answers on your request you do not receive only information about their cancellation policy They do not know the word accommodation In anyway I will never use Amoma again
Took seriously long to ship the product the shape of the package whwn arrived was crap and quality of the jewelre i orderded was pure crap None of them were useable
In some ways the site is nice to use but a few simple steps seem to be missing  very difficult to enter a transaction reference and I initiated a transaction on Friday evening the site told me to transfer my money over then but it didnt actually convert it until Monday when the exchange rate had changed and the conversion amount was wrong that was sent to the recipient Why not warn users of this on the transaction page at the very least
Omline staff helpful but would not recommend
I received a few dead roses nothing like what I paid for Ordered bouquet called madame  received about 56 dead flowers
You allow me to book and then cancelled payment with excues that bank was refusing payment
My recent purchase was an automatic renewal of my annual membership
Although I signed that contract I appreciate to be automatically informed by email that my automatically renewal date is approaching So that I can rethink my annual membership Thank you for your consideration to add that feature to your service
I spent 5 days to know how much I ll refund and after 7 phone only what I receive from them just keep in holding they sent me email to refund only taxes which is 333 from total paid 1510 all of them laiers gave us many promises to solve my issue and nothing mentioned while I am booking that is non refundable and even after booking they sent terms and conditions mentioned that some airline required fees for cancellation or non refund but they are not spicified to any airline so I have to guess that my flight non refundable  Nothing mentioned that non refundable there are big liars thieves I need to escalate it to higher level and advise everyone not to book through them really specially their supervisor his name mohsen he dont know nothing about customer service and how to handle customers  Avoid them
I paid for a full service and was told I had to pay 130 for antifreeze and brake fluid flush the garage said they could do this for 54
I took my car to my local garage today as some other work needed doing and was told a full service had not been due
No oil filter fuel filter or air filter fitted
Service stop have not done any of the work and even the garage they took it to said service stop will rip you off and said they would do the work for half the price I was Quote d Service stop also try to bully you into paying extortionate prices for extras
Ink Farm sent me the wrong ink I hope they refund without making me jump through a thousand hoops I sent back the wrong ink and have since bough the right kind They better credit my account or I will dispute the charge Email me again and I will let you know if they did the right thing in another review
My roommate has ordered a lot of things from fabletics and i had a handful of things i came to the sight to buy but you were out of stock for every single thing i wanted some were completely out of stock or you didnt have the size or color i wanted this is the third time i have tried to order when everything was out of stock i finally settled for the next size down in the leggings i have been wanting to get Im so disappointed i didnt get to purchase everything i was hoping to obtain i hope the leggings are long enough for me because Im sure ill get the run around if i want to return them
Booking a home without visiting for a period of one year is stressful as is I submitted my booking late on a Wednesday night and by Monday end of business day did not hear anything from the landlord My agent was in touch briefly Thursday and Friday but as the 48 hour deadline came to a close Monday I heard nothing
The site should have a capability similar to Airbnb wherein applicants can directly message landlords  already you cant visit the place or see it before you commit to a decent sum of money and booking a longterm home this is the least that should be done My agent was unable to reach the landlord and I wasted a lot of time trying to plan around moving into this place as I have excellent references and all required paperwork when moving into a new place none of which was ever requested or passed on to the landlord
I will not be using the site again or recommending it and was really interested in the property and now have to restart my housing search
i ordered sofa 30 days ago and i still dont get it
Im just writing this review to somehow contact support I had an issue where my password was wrong after I tried to login for the first time I tried resetting the password but the link given is broken I cant login to submit a ticket and I cant do anything please help
They gave me the wrong pads so ive called them in fairness after a month Ive picke the pads I do understand 30 days return policy but thats is just when i just change my mind
In this case its the product is called unusable not fit for purpose and I had right to return it after 30 days End of story 
I dont like because you need pay all time
If i pay 1 year Why pay all time
I went to book a flight with Tripsta on Tuesday night when I pushed the payment button it said that the flight was no longer available When I checked my bank account the money has come out and I have been charged for a flight but have no booking I have tried ringing the number that is on the website but it does not work I tired the UK number and that too does not work I have sent emails but have had a random reply that does not help me and noone has tried to ring me I cannot believe that a company can have service like this I cant even speak to anyone to get my money back This is so frustrating
The games are old and dont work i took 4 games back became they had the wrong disk in youre better off buying on ebay
Great price and great furniture but we paid extra to have it set up and delivered and when it came in from their warehouse they acted like we had no agreement and we had to pay more for the company to deliver it after paying extra for it already
It took way too long longer than 5 days if I remember correctly to get them to review my book My book was then rejected The book had some wear on the corners of the front and back covers plus two used book stickers I then went else where which will respectfully remain nameless and they accepted the book the day they received it I was also paid the same day by nameless company and received more than I was Quote d from sellbackyourBookcom I wont waste my time again by going back to sellbackyourBookcom due to lengthy poor experience
My vehicle was collected for MOT and service on the 22nd December 2016 When trying to sell my car on the 19th February I found out that the paperwork eventually sent to me was the last years MOT and the car had not been registered on the Govrnment website
I had to go to the garage direct as Servicing stop promised they would collect the car on the Monday which the failed to arrange
My email to them
They do not come back to you and you have to constantly ring them
This email will go to the owners of Servicing Stop
As you may remember I had a nightmare when I had a service and MOT and some work done on my car through Servicing Stop
The car initially was not completed then it wasnt done on the day specified Then the garage did not send the MOT
I have just had a real issue
 The car was serviced on the 22nd December 2016
 You sent me the MOT but the MOT you sent me was the previous years MOT
 The company you used did not register the MOT and it is not recognised on the government records so this left me liable for the police stopping me as there is no records of me having the MOT neither me or the person I was trying to sell my vehicle have ever heard of this
 The Company who carried out the MOT now insist I have to take the car to their workshop even though it was their mistake
 I was in the process of selling my car for 12000 when this was raised causing the offer being retracted so I have lost the offer through the garages incompetence and I wasted the whole weekend
 If I hadnt raised this I would have been driving without any proof of the MOT your appointed company carried out
 On advice I will be reporting the garage who carried out my MOT to the authorities for failure to follow government mandated process
 My first contact on this left the phone engaged and did not get back to me and another did not believe I was working away from home next week I can provide the hotel bookings
They were supposed to pick my car up on the Monday they hadnt even arranged for it to be picked up
They were supposed to use a competent garage The reviews for the garage was awful
So apart from the initial problems of using Servicing Stop
 I have no evidence of my current MOT or service
 I have no MOT logged with the Government
 I have lost a chance to sell the vehicle at price which was good for me
 I have wasted time and money from the garages failure
This is not acceptable service
Please put this right and check the dates on the email you sent to me
Wrong MOT with the wrong date
No MOT listed on the government database
I have had to go to the garage direct as your operator did not come back to me as promised
Apparently the operator who told me that the car would be collected today Monday lied it was never arranged
The worst customer service I have ever experienced
I wait to see how this garage is going to sort the mileage out with the government database now
I have no option but to take this matter further as no one is contacting me back
Again
You have cost me time and expense and a lost chance of selling my vehicle
Worst ever company
I wanted to cancel my flight because an error INMEDIATELY just seconds after having confirmed and even when assistant was kind I can not believe its not possible to refound exactly as all companies had done in VUELING and IBERIA THAT i HAVE CALLED and cancelled the payment as the request have been inmediate
I booked online with doyouspaincom and it turned out they had appointed Delpaso to supply the vehicle I landed today 12th Feb 2017 Malaga Spain they pick me up and take me to this con company Delpaso and they wanted either 100 for a full tank in a Fiat Panda which actually would cost only approx 40 or I pay 116 and I just bring the car back with a full tank and it includes insurance So they entice you to take their insurance and and the full to full tanks Despite the fact I paid online for my hire car in advance it became completely irrelevant as I said I above they wanted more money I recommend you avoid this company at all costs As neither company will refund me
They dont tell you but they are not based in Ireland
My brake discs took over a week to come from Belgium
Never again
I travelled quite several times with Alitalia and I noticed how some of their flight attendants  usually men  were rude and impatient In flights from Tehran to Roma even though I always select the seats at the time of booking at counter they assign a different seat and of course always exact opposit of what I asks and they give false justifictions for that like the plane has changed and so that seat doesnt exist anymore and similar
In a recent flight same story happend because at the counter they were so rude and patetic so I asked the flight attendant after I enterd the plane to let me use the same seat I had selected I could see online that my seat was still the same I had selected even two hours after I had recieved my boarding pass The guy nearly eats me I asked very kindly by showing my reservation and seat number
Afterall I had to use the assigned seat on boarding pass right on top of the wings  what I exactly had asked please if you change my seat do not give me one on wings  After boarding was complete I had to gather my thing and go for a better seat and as always find that my selected seat was there empty and other people in the rows before and after So I think there was not any kind of problem with that seat but just some people wake up in the morning go to work and take their problems and empty their anger on poor tired passengers
Wouldnt rent again
This was my first experience using FlightHub Lots of hidden fees charges and corrections My final price was 250 higher than the starting price I would have been better off going with an airline directly It was difficult understanding the customer service representative when I called for clarification on the increases even though I could tell she was trying to help I doubt Ill be using them again
HICE UNA COMPRA DESDE EL 2 DE MARZO Y NO PUEDEN EMITIR MI FACTURA LOS OPERADORES TELEFONICOS NO DAN NINGUNA SOLUCION

Your current location towncity country time zone
Organisational eg company name details of your payment card providers

I do not want the magazine subscription and will toss once i receive this Do not include this on the order as I ordered before I realized I deleted it
Had to pay 30 dollars st usps for shippingfor a return shipping from DC Chinese laundry should make this very clear this is not abnormal shipping cost for a few pairs of shoes Will not order again unless shipping is reasonable and guaranteed or sold on Zappos
I paid with my PayPal account and my address registered on this is french Whatever the delivery writing on their website for the payment with PayPal they just take the address of the account
The girl from the Hotline are not very accomodating also
I went with Energia because an online calculator said I would make massive savings I got no bonus or incentive for signing up  just the promise of cheaper bills My bills are exactly the same and I will be reporting their false advertising
We had to pick up our car from Port Douglas Airport When we reached to the kiosk to pick up the car It took us 1 hour in the line of 3 people to get our car as the staff was busy chatting with the other people came to pick up and providing them information on where to go in Port Douglas
That wasted lot of our time
I bought access to Campaings but It still not working ZPartnerpl in POland cant or wont help us Communication with them is difficoult not answering or once a day dont pick up the phone dont call back As a company we cent start with mass mailing
Goddamn it Stay away ZOHO 
We chose the Q5 category Q5 GLC XC60 Of course we only received the cheapest car of this category the Volvo XC60 with 24000 km
The car was dirty
The alarm list included the following
Service required
Safety Service required
FWD left tire low pressure
Parking alarm sensors out of order
The tire was indeed out of air Even when filled it up the alarm remained
The worst car ever rented in terms of what we paid for and what we received
When we arrived at Ft Myers Beach to pick up the keys to the condo we rented one year earlier they werent there This was at 930 pm with a car full of groceries We called VRPs emergency number and were told that property was no longer theirs and they according to our contract have the right to move us to different lodging So thats what they did Two hours later we were at a less desirable unit and location then what we rented Vacations are supposed to be a time to get away from stress for a while and relax This caused A lot of stress for my husband and I The next day we moved again into the unit we wanted but we lost a day of our vacation and had to dispose of groceries They said they would make it right but so far after emailing stopping into the office twice and calling customer service twice not a word Customer service is poor I hope this doesnt happen to youl
At first they tried sell that expensive extra insurance even we already had one Then 1200 deposit We took pictures scratches what where in that car we we got it Scratches were also marked in that paper we got from office We dropped car at 0500 am and office was closed so key to the box no staff there After day they sent picture of scratch what already was in the car we got it And some other picture which one is so unclear just dusty car you can see nothing in pictures even you look in photoshop Marked scratch has marked in the paper and and shows photoes which we took when we got the car In photoes are date and time Now they reduce 200 from deposit Car was without fail in same condition when we left it when we got it Im very disappointed to Goldcar and for that you have solve this kind of thing absolutely without reason
So Victoria R how can I reach you I have sent several messages to you but nobody answers I can sent also these attachmentpictures which proves that scratches were there already before we got car
I have been trying to contact them for hours on a transaction that says it is sent immediately I have submitted multiple reports for help and also contacted them on facebook They asked for the order numbers on facebook and then never got back to me again this is completely unacceptable
Item not as described
My order is a cod but I made a payment through online and also paid the amount at the time of delivery but none of your executives from finance team called me regarding this issue to resolve it
Order No 1206709975

Hi SirMadam
My booking reference is  049171122 and my name is Pawandeep Singh Mann DOB 11 july 1994 I am having issues with booking my seat with Air India flight operated by Air Canada AI Flight 7312 and AI Flight 7343 from Toronto to London and London to Toronto because you have not provided me PNR no for Air Canada because your system did not generate it You need to fix this problem ASAP becuase your employees have given me a really hard time I called both Air India and Air Canada airline with regards to this issueAir Canda agents advised that they are not having any pnr no for us inorder to book our seats They cant find any hold of a seat for me and my fellow passengerUpinder kaur LNU I was on call with flight hub last night until 2 am in morning It was my worst experience
I will never boook any of my tickets with flight hub ever in future if this issue will not be resolved until next 1hour Moreover customer service was not at all good They just asked me to provide confirmation number to air canada or e ticket no to book seats but you dont understand that air canda has different reference number 6 digits alphanumeric which is missing Even last night one of your customer representative hold my call for 1 hr and she never came back on call Please mind that dont call and bother me again just fix it by an hour or two at the most Otherwise I will take legal action against you guys Dont take this lightly I really mean it If you dont want to lose your valuable customer fix the issue by providing me the Air Canada 6 digit alphanumeric reference number this is all I need from you guys
Waiting for a positive and your immediate response on this Thank you in advance for taking this into consideration
I made a 2nd order on Friday 130317 and havent received it yet you deducted 8050 from my account I am still waiting to receive it
The website was very glitchy and difficult to use I am hoping the clothing quality makes it worth the difficulty of the website
The original web site showed a price of 79 The reservation site showed 94 The final price is 122
I realize you will argue your price is actually in the 90 range and all hotels are hit with the additional fees But a little honesty on the part of all hotel listings would be appreciated
Waited over two weeks without hearing anything from Res Bands Aus or receiving products so emailed to find out what was going on Received a reply advising that I should have received notification that orders had been delayed due to supply shortages I didnt get this email
Following this I was told I could either wait for an additional 2 weeks for the supply to arrive or receive a different brand but the same product however was told the cost of this would be higher I asked if I could be sent the bands they did have in stock as soon as possible which I was advised they would be still took over 2 weeks to receive following this
Bands seem fine but given there are a lot of the same products online I would recommend going with a different brand as to wait over a month for something like this without any word until I followed up is not acceptable from my perspective
Save yourself the trouble and order from a different supplier
Too bad Amazon used to sell vapes and it seems these businesses are small havent been in business long and are not dependable I waited for 6 days to receive my CFX and waited another day for my kid to come over to help me Sorry I am an older medical MJ patient and not terribly tech savvy The first time I used it prior to even getting any benefit from it I accidentally broke a piece off the mouthpiece and after lots of examination and attempts we realized it was impossible to put back on So I look for their contact and help and learn they have no phone number no longer have a chat and only respond by email which they warn hapless customers is backed up with high volume and few or stoned employees I want this handled now and dont want to wait I posted on their FB page and pmed and it said they respond in one day but that might have been an older notification I will wait until Monday afternoon to just contact my bank to reverse No I dont care about discrete and this is a legal state too
Their guarantee says in later notes that the customer must pay shipping both ways As this is a heavy item it is likely this is nearly as much as the cost of the product
Does anyone know a reputable vape company as I havent found one Is there a major credible company that sells these products Reddit recommended Puffitup and their website didnt work with my cc
Not happy with response
I have been using this service for half a year now but just recently opened an account in America It has been secure and timely until my last experience this week Since Im new here and my SSN is for a legal immigrant the information page said it needed to verify my information and took me back to the data page 4 times instead of the transaction completed page I gave up and though nothing happened because it never notified me that anything had been completed Until the next day when I had been notified that I had over drawn my bank account by 1700 Then when I called transferwise they said they could do anything to stop it because it had gone through in the less than 24 hours since I filled out the order I then had to call my bank in Canada and learned they transfer money for free internationally I sent back the thousands of dollars transferwise withdrew and overdrew from my account but lost 60 from the change in exchange from the day Transferwise faulty website helpless customer service and my own mistake thinking nothing happened caused me to have no money in my American account for days and I was not compensated for their faulty software If an order needs time to be verified its fine But my problem is it never notified me I made four transactions instead of one I was just taken back to the same data page over and over again Thats incredibly irresponsible from a company that is trying to grow a positive reputation And the fact that customer service said the only thing I could do was call me bank and ask them to block the transfer and now Im down 60 is a bit of a sting
Booked vehicle for a full service Inc oilair
Car picked up by their garage of choice on day and returned the same day Was called during the day by servicing stop that specialist oil neededadditional cost Agreed reluctantly
When vehicle returned there was remains of the mechanics lunch in the car  dont worry it gets worse
Looked over the work carried out and compared to service report received from servicing stop The car had hardly been touched Air filter not replaced brakes not bled bonnet fluids not topped up hose leak not replaced fumes coming into cabin water pump needed replacing car broke down while driving and lost power steeringluckily I managed not to crash the vehicle Charged for specialist oil that was never required
Emailed customer service on numerous occasions for answers and details of the garage used Photographic evidence and independent garage report sent to them But yet to receive any answers Customer service is non existent
I have contacted Citizens Advice and details have been forwarded to Trading Standards
Avoid these guys like the plague
Rak
Made a reservation and was confirmed for booking with a rental facility that is closed for the time I reserved Waste of my time
The parcel was not picked up when agreed in fact it was picked up two days late making for very unhappy customers in our retail business Not acceptable may return to the Post Office
The Holden provided was a lovely surprise ran well and was well presented The only comment I could suggest would be a larger a more permanent looking receptionwaiting area While waiting my turn to be served it was very stuffy and cramped in the cabin Redspot are currently operating out of there in the city However I will be using this company again  MC
FRAUDSTERS shocked u will be tried to defraud my 1 year old daughter out of 25 of her money no shame then when I queried this fee said is was in contract when I pointed out I read all small print and it clearly said she was on no fee basis and check they DIDNT instead the lazy staff popped me a contract with pages missing the main being the suitibilty agreement which clearly stated this and they should of has contract complete not send me some doctored half contract when I phone back couldnt get hold of the girl left messages no class back for over a week till I had to call back again took over 10 calls shes still insisted asked her have u checked paperwork shes was insistent and wouldnt listen advices her u get paid for a job if u dont want to do it and want me to do it I will bill us he said fine I then had to prove my CASE and and find clause with no fees she after wasted countless days on thiswriting letters calls I demanding the 300 I lost which I told her in calls if she wouldnt do due deligence I would bill her for doing her job she refused payment then after much complaining and speak to another rude client care person who when I told him she had tried to rip us off my points out to me ITS NOT YOUR MONEY ITS YOUR DAUGHTERS very rude pointed out is it ok to rip Here off then and who do I work for my kids should I leave them on streets and say its my money stupid to says least then even goes as far a says we dont need to listen to your instructions I pointed outs it my daughter Ill fire u and take care elsewhere he said would investigate
Came back week or so later offered me 50 an insult yet probably thinks there occupation is exempt and charge anything and our time or occupation dont hold same value if u look at there fees they charge between 200 to 450 per hour I think I was generous as I had to send more emails and says yet more time when I pointed this out stopped replying altogether forwarding to legal ombudsman And sra solictoes regulatory authority
Bottom line is if I had not kept paperwork and read small print they would of ripped my 1 year old daughter of of close to 1000 or so and claimed of insurance company to and got paid twice dishonest and greedy comes to mind
So after a month and opening a paypal case after paying extra cost for custom charges and extra for USA rates I have finally have my item
No communication lied about shipping an item giving a false tracking number At the end my parcel was shipped from Hong Kong
Wow Dont bother
I received a shipping confirmation on February 16 2017 As of today I did not receive my item Customer support is incompetent They did not understand the questions I was asking them I may request a refund either from PlayAsia or PayPal if I do not receive my item within 5 business days I will never do business with PlayAsia again
About a month ago I bought 2 tickets around 500 for an Ed Sheeran Concert in Madrid which is happening in 8th April One week later someone from ticketbis called me telling me that they would be sending me the tickets right away which didnt happen Ive tried to contact them by email and by the online chat for days and still dont have my tickets It seems like that the critics of ticketbis service are indeed true  this is a scam
I asked for a 23 x 18 matte with a one inch border and I received a matte with literally ONE INCH SQUARE in the middle When I took it to Michaels to fix they laughed at the site of it I then I had to pay another 40 to get it fixed
We were pushed into changing suppliers Obviously your agentscustomer care have to meet difficult targets We were assured that we would notice a significant difference in our bills and that we did A 500 bill in the door after Christmas We are in our home 14 years and never even had a double bill ie 4 months ever come close We have left you Never again
What service Ive waited 3 weeks and still havent received the delivery The nearest thing to pants I can think of
Did not want to open pkg and return to sender wo paying gor shopping back to Hong Kong They refused and only would reimburse upon return and inspection Forced to open pkg only to find no sunglasses All makes sense now Run from them despite low prices
Virtually just sent a list of insurance companies
The online chat service staff was very rude and simply wanted to rush me out of the conversation She closed the conversation directly without checking if I have other questions or even say bye Very bad online service I ever had
I have a conference code for a reduced rate and there was nowhere to enter it I got an email about getting a 15 discount for returning and finishing my booking but that didnt work If it were not the official conference hotel I would not have booked
Make sure you have some flight ticket with you when you pick up the car otherwise you wont get it Might only be suitable if you come straight from the airport not if you want to rent a car coming from town
No recomendable se tiene que presentar un boleto de vuelo si no no se puede recoger el coche Nada para clientes que no vienen directo del aeropuerto
I was asked to respond to a query and the web page wont allow me to reply as Ive already sent a message today When I rang the automated response encouraged that I contact online instead
I also rang twice last week to confirm that I would only be free from 130pm for the installation to take place I got confirmation via text to say that they would arrive after 1 so instead of ringing a third time I rearranged things in work to allow me to get home for 1pm just in case
The installer arrived at 12 luckily my housemate was at home but that meant that he had to wait in the house for half an hour while the installation took place I spoke to the installer on the phone and he said he was never informed that I wouldnt be available until 1pm He himself was very polite and this is not a complaint about him but about the management behind the scenes
I waited 3 months to get the boiler service from my order this is the reason of my rating
Also the offer included the installation of a device to monitor your energy
The operator worked fine happy with his job but he didnt know about the device or compatibility
1 month after the service done called to support to know about the device and by default my boiler is not compatible when the technician didnt know about that thing
Based in the age of my house someone estimates that my boiler is not compatible doesnt matter if i changed the boiler two years ago
Id never book another service with Energia Im sorry
This is a disgusting site deposited 10 and had nothing but hassle to try and play bingo due to all there different settings Got in touch with them to try and refund my money and they WOULD not refund it just signed on to it just now and they have removed me with no credit I WOULD NOT TOUCH IT WITH A BARGE POLE ALSO THEY ARE VERY RUDE I WARN YOU DONT TOUCH IT I AM REALLY FUMING Didnt want to give a star at all but wont let you write anything to you give them a star arseholes
Heard from them once and I have had no contact since Total waste of my time
The material of the dress is cheap and lacking quality The skirt part is a cheap polyester The bodice part doesnt look like the pictures online The beading is cheap white The style of the dress is nice and it fit well but we are not happy with the dress at all
Prices differe from advertised 
Totally unprofessional Once our stuff was packed and moved from our house they sent no status updates Our stuff is still at the place of origin  almost 2 months after the move The contact person at the company keeps giving the same response week after week  that it will ship this week Will not recommend them for international moves
Edited to add Our inventory is still not shipped and no response to our emails Totally frustrated dealing with this company
Flowers were good but didnt deliver on the correct day and did not inform me of the delay Bought mothers day flowers which included a mothers day balloon but received a happy birthday balloon instead Would not use again or recommend
Order a boutique to go to my new sisterinlaw in Germany thought it would be a nice surprise They sent me photos the boutique was nothing like the image advertised with a lot of green foliage and not many flowers and some of the flowers were past their best My brotherinlaw said I should ask for a refund I contacted Euroflorist no response so went through Paypal and got a refund Would I use again NO WAY AVOID
Searched google for same day delivery florist companies and Telefloras site popped up I selected a bouquet to send to a friend for her birthday because something came up and I was unable to attend the celebration I placed the order and received confirmation email at 100pm on a Tuesday confirming the delivery would arrive to her by the end of the day JUST WAIT
I receive a call by a rep at 515pm saying they were unable to deliver the order that day because the florist already delivered to that area Okay Couldnt have let me know sooner Anyways she promised and guaranteed the order would be delivered the following day Wednesday and I convinced her to give me 30 off the deal
Well here we are on Wednesday and I just got an email notification stating they were unable to deliver my order today because none of the florists had the arrangement it was a basic 25 bouquet not hard to come up with something and they could get it out tomorrow Thursday The rep I spoke to said the rep yesterday must have been lazy in updating her notes and its an issue they have within the company OKAY Sorry dont care Ill take my happy a to the store and buy her flowers and deliver myself at this point
Bottom line they advertise same day delivery call you at the very last minute at end of day to break the news that they cant get the order out so you cant cancel and order with someone else charge an absurd service and delivery fee and dont even provide what they charge for
To the company execs you should spend more time and money focusing on your servicing department rather on your advertisements and google search engine optimization Whats the point in attracting more people to the business when its run so poorly FYI if you are 3 days late on a same day delivery order cover the costs yourselves and offer to do it for free
MOVE ALONG PEOPLE DONT USE THIS SITE
hello i have rented a car for my wedding and paid 100 to rent the car Before I brought the car back I took it to a car wash to make sure they cant say anything
The car was new and at the car wash they have made it a hairline scratch about 15cm long
They have charged me 200 for that outrageous in my opinion since to fix the scrach it would need a polish only
Best adviceStay away
Not impressed Chairs come completely apart and you must put together with multi size Allen wrenches The chairs are constantly needing tightening on the arms foot rests since day 1 I called about a chair doing a wobble clients felt like they were on a boat even sent a video I was told to take the base apart of the faulty chair and a good chair and swap out the hydraulic and the base to figure out what part was defective I did not do this because I was afraid to ruin 2 chairs I am now looking for 7 new styling chairs I will be making sure most of the product is put together for durability Its a bit embarrassing that a client is worried about my wobbly arms I worry that the main attachment in the back of the chair is getting worn out from constant tightening and will break as a client is entering or exiting the styling chair then I will be left with no functioning chair Very disappointing
Ive flown with norwegian for many years and was a loyal customer However at recent times my flight is always delayed by at least an hour up to 5 hours It can not be right that I repeatedly experiencing delays every time I fly with Norwegian They have unfortunately lost a loyal customer because it seems that they do not intend to do anything about the problem
I tried number of times to book two tickets on line and also by telephone but I wasnt successful As result of this I paid 200euro extra for each on the same booking which were booked a day later
Im 55 130lbs 27 waist and 34DDD and ordered the sexy white pleated v cut strapless aline party dress in a size M for my bach party Im on the cusp of SM typically M because of larger bust I didnt even fill the top half out seriously worst quality and nothing like the picture The whole dress looks like a cheap sheet of fabric and fit nothing like on the model I wouldnt even exchange this for a smaller size or different dress Disappointed in what they advertise vs what you receive
My renewal was 200 more expensive than applying as a new customer Disgusting how u penalise ur customers
I ordered a small toy from Gameseek the clear glass display case it arrived in was smashed to pieces due to inadequate packing a small jiffy bag
Took so long to get any response from Gameseek I had to gift the damaged item anyway and now had to escalate via PayPal in order to get some form of compensation
In summary poor packaging resulting in significant damage delayed responses very dismissive and completely unhelpful Will not use again and pass this message on to others
Has anybody received an email from DeluxeHostingcom Their emails are formatted with all kinds of special characters included in the text and you have to spend time deciphering and then talking to them on the phone is even worse Supervisors act like youre wasting their time
I paid for overnight shipping and neglected to indicate unit number on address Instead of contacting me to verify unit number the package was a day late Why not reach out and check the info
I had been using a different dialer system for some time and decided to switch to Five9 because of all the good reviews thinking the system was going to be an improvement but for over three weeks during the implementation process I had issues almost every day The support team was always willing to help but the problems persisted A month later I can say that the system in terms of call quality is good it has a lot of good options in regards to monitoring agents activities
It may have worked well for other customers but my experience has been awful Im still experiencing issues thinking about switching back to the previous provider Lost a lot of time and money
The checks and the info are exactly what I wanted but the ability to remove the check from the duplicate left in the bookinstead it tears at the top every time
Very poor service Rugby top ordered in shop on 160317 was assured it would be delivered in store on the Saturday 18th by 1pm Went to store no top and could not get a refund until the top came in Called the shop numerous times on Sunday rang out Got a text from someone in the store on Tuesday 21st to say the top was in call in when it suits for my refund Top was a gift for my brother who went back to the states on the Sunday Not impressed at all and will never ever shop in Lifestyle again
I had the worst experience of my life dealing with reantalcarscom The website clearly said Unlimited Mileage and when I went to pickup the rental car the rude and unhappy person at the reception at economy rent a car told me that I am allowed 200kmday I will never use this website again and will suggest that everyone else avoid it as well
I tried to buy a ski helmet It showed in stock Bought it Got an e mail saying delivery 34 days Waited a week and contacted them They told me it was due in in another 34 days from their supplier I rang on the 14th day Still not received from their supplier and not going to be as they dont have it either Order cancelled and refunded when I asked but they should have said that they didnt have it I did all the chasing Price was good but I had to go to the high street in the end
Left because its impossible to speak to a human being
 Shipping was super fast from Hong Kong to Sweden
 I ordered the RayBan New Wayfarer 2132 but got a model RAJ1212AA The model is not found or sold on the Rayban official website At a glance they look like RB 2132 but there were some differences compared to current original RayBan New Wayfarer The glasses came in a white neutral box without the RayBan packaging and without bar code
Smartbuyglasses manager replied to my complaint by email Quote  Not all brands come with authenticity cardsThey do not always include all labels and tags within their packaging This is not communicated via the smartbuyglasses website when making a purchase Furthermore I received no explanation as to why the glasses I ordered are not availablefound in any RayBan official website Smartbuyglasses claim the glasses were authentic I have very strong doubts about that
I sent the glasses back for a full refund I had to pay for tracked shipping I will not shop here again and I do not recommend shopping from this website

I just want to send flowers and already enter details from my credit card It is ANOYIN that these sites all demand to get my personal details as well I will never remember all these passwords every time you do some random internets hopping someone fished my details This site will not be stored under my favourites  why do these IT departments not talk to marketing and try to get on favourite list of users this is how you can increase CSI and have repeat customers

Booked flights to lanzarote only realise I had made mistake my name is different on my passport I no longer use my married name Contacted last minute to request the change to both my flights with BA and monarch I had called the airlines separately to be told yes it could be done but I had to go through last minute 7 days later I am still waiting absolutely nothing at all to say if it can be done or how much it will cost I also called several times on one occasion to try to sort the car hire to be told that I had to call an international number in lanzarote to change the name at 6 Euros a minute and would have to put my credit card details in I said I couldnt call this number on my mobile and I no longer have a landline to be told by very rude customer service representative that that was my problem  Despite that fact I had called 2 days earlier to be told that they could change the name from their end 
Terrible service
Very bad item Never work
Well I ordered a penis extender to fix the small curve I have
The website states that after wearing the extender 3 months it should be sraight again
Now Im not an impulsive guy and I dont give up easily but even after 8 months there wasnt the slightest improvement
Yeah there was a difference in my bank account
Glad I only bought the cheapest pack they have
Maybe for other people this device might work but to me it was useless
Wasted 8 months wore it like like 45 hours a day
The problem nowadays with the internet is that it becomes hard to find real peoples experiences because websites can make accounts to recommend their products basically anywhere
I hope companies never get on this website
Goldcar Barcelona has a very intimidating way of upselling insurances The way they try to make more money is harassing and unpleasant Upon return of the car they tried to let us sign for damage a small spot which was easily removed with the sleeve of my sweater When we didnt agree to sign they finally agreed that everything was OK todo OK they wrote on our contract Not only did we encounter very aggressive personnel we als are worried about our deposit
I had to fight inorder to get my iphone unlocked but in the end it was done fast

I got all my books back and paid for the shipment
The pickup point at Heathrow is not specified on the voucher so I call on the phone As I call from Hong Kong the phone defaults to Cantonese which I do not speak They person answers with Cantonese accent she cannot explain the pick up or bus details her supervisor comes on the phone and explains everything very nicely It gives me concerns about the processes assumptions and lack of empathy inherent in the company
I took the day off just to wait for my delivery of a rocking chair i was waiting all day then i saw the truck pull up to my house so i went to put the dog in his kennel for safe keeping the delivery guy just put up a paper slip on my door when i opened the door he drove off HE DID NOT EVEN KNOCK on my door  and im pregnant how am i suppose to go pick my heavy item up now i thank you for your lazy employees i called purolator right away to see if they can send the driver back asap because he obviously inst doing his job but they cant do this so now i have to take another day off and hope that the delivery guy knows how to use his hands for actually knocking on a door meanwhile my rocking chair is most likely being tossed around who knows where getting damaged
Recently ordered some Champ Zarma Fly Tees from Clubhouse Golf as i had been given these at a proam I had played in I was very impressed at the durability of these tees and how long each one lasted so I ordered some When they arrived i took some out to use during a round on the very first drive it snapped i couldnt believe it so later in the round i tried another one that snapped as well I got on the phone to Clubhouse Golf who informed me that all tees snap and that my original ones couldnt have lasted as long as i had claimed i was furious On closer inspection i noticed my original tees seemed a different material to the ones Clubhouse Golf had sent me So I ordered the same product from American Golf to see if it was a manufacturing issue but when arrived they were exactly the same as my original tees I noticed the ones from Clubhouse Golf were made in Thailand the ones from American Golf were made in China one is really brittle the other is very bendyl will not be ordering from Clubhouse Golf any more as i thought they were very rude and condescending
I had no problem placing the order on behalf of my disabled client who needed some aids for her physiotherapy sessions and we soon received notice of despatch after paying for a next day delivery The problems began when the courier company did not make the delivery but updated online that they had attempted to make a delivery but noone was at home As there were four adults in the house at the supposed time of attempted delivery and we had just taken delivery of something from another supplier I immediately informed PhysioRoom about this Then started an almost comical scenario where PhysioRoom told me to contact the courier Hermes direct and Hermes claimed that I had to direct any complaints through the retailer After wasting way too much time going backwards and forwards the goods were finally delivered 3 days after the order had been placed  but too late for the physiotherapy session that had been scheduled
I was sent an item they sell on their website but it was not the item I purchased They try to deny all fault but it is impossible to buy said item as they are the only sellers of it and that was the only time I have ever shopped with them
I would be very very wary of this business as there goods are either not as described or they try to deny all responsibility
spent  on a program and said it had support now Im being told I have to hunt down basically the author being told to look for three different pages some where no clue and now even have a rep telling me i might not have support at all depending on what I bought
I dont think this is a scam bc I got the program however it is eating up most of my server resources although it says to need only 128MB to run and is pushing 500MB with ONLY the program installed by itself so I NEED SUPPORT
Since Im not getting support after 2 days of emailing and am being told to go look for links instead of just given the links Envato gets a 1 star
This is horrible support especially after taking my money days ago and so you deserve less than 1 star
The address picker at the beginning does not seem to register a lot of addresses Have to pick a random one then change when finalising the order Apart from that its great
Very terrible delivery service After waiting all day when furniture was supposed to arrive i was skipped Then try to contact delivery dept And could not reach them  Finally after contacting store they also could not reach them for another day they wanted me to take another day off to wait for the delivery
Bought the holder for the shower head that slides up and down the pipe that supplies the water from above with the thermostatic mixer  controls permanently mounted on the bottom of the pipe
The picture of the new design for the holder appeared to show a split at the back  which would have meant it could be mounted on the 1 pipe without calling in a plumber to disconnect the whole unit
When it arrived I could see that the slider was based around a closed cylindrical sleeve  so not what I had hoped for

Very unpleasant experience with this company I have never experienced anything like it They are cheap for a reason their customer services leave an awful lot to be desiredimpossible to contact and appear to be totally understaffed they are leaving me without a car for 2 days while they review my documentation despite promising me they would sort it for me if I emailed photos of documentation to them
Only use if you are happy for a staranger to drive 40 to 50 miles away from your home  Also check with the company where your car is going as the email they send you may not be the garage that it is actually going to The fuel that they will use and wear and tear on your car may be cheaper taking it closer to home for what it is worth Only sounds cheap  Only good thing was the confirmation  cancelling of booking was very quick 
I am astounded dumbfounded over this
I have contacted them 11 times now Ive purchased a lot of money worth of items and nothing has shipped for 3 weeks No movement whatsoever
I am so sad I didnt check reviews first I dont even know what to do about it I guess I can contact my bank and consider these fraudulent charges Fanatics customer service responds regularly but just gives the same answer
We are sorry and we will ship soon
It must be all fake and coming from China Nothing else in the united states takes this long
I threw the shower brush in the trashIt was made cheaply
They lost my order Was a great deal but it didnt make it to the store so i can pick up
Horrible experience i got a dress that looked nothing like the one i purchased the dress came snagged horrible stitching i could cry right this was for my engagement shoot please whatever u do dont take no chances with these people and I made a review and they only allow good reviews to be posted they denied my review
On Feb 28 I ordered and paid a unlock service for my iPhone  Im still waiting With not too much hope but still waiting Despite all this positiv rating I think unlock river is a fraud

Ordered the 100 Roses and to be fair the process of ordering and delivery was 5 stars without fault and on time with ample communication However the quality of what was delivered was more than disappointing I paid the extra to go large and thank god i did as i would hate to see what the small version would have been To put it into perspective i got 120 roses into a vase i would normally stick 6 at a push 12 normal size roses
The photo is a gross oversell of what the product is the reality being each of the rose heads were smaller than a 20p coin
And to top it all of they were delivered Friday had drooped heads by Saturday Evening and were in the bin by Sunday evening
I was more disappointed than i have been with interflora whom i no longer use who are renowned for using elaborate photos when selling compared to what are actually delivered
Sadly i cannot recommend this site  the quality of flowers  in short the local petrol station would have been better
I REALLY APPRECIATED THE TIME HE TOOK With ME his explanations his patience Nice experience and I would recommend others to this store
Order not received
These guys sold a pump with a 12 month warranty The pump failed They wanted us to fork out 50 for a report They refused to take it back The Consumers Right Bureau totally back us on this Have purchased many items off the guys in the past so are totally gutted with their response considering theyve admitted that we are one of many with the same fault Gobsmacked and let down
This was by far my worst experience renting a car ever
The lady at the counter in Tenerife airport was very unfriendly actually totally inappropriate and rude
I had to pay a large deposit from my bank account though this was not specified when I booked Usually a car rental company only blocks the amount When I pointed that out to the lady at the counter and asked her to please explain she treated me very hostile She grabbed my creditcard out of my hand put it in the machine and told me I wouldnt get the car or my money back if I didnt press my PINnumber and payed the deposit now
So I did
When I got the deposit back after my rental was over I got about 70 euroes less because I got it at another conversion rate This I had absolutely no power over
All in all it ended up being much more expensive than other car rental companies at the airport
A really bad way to start and end a holiday
I reserved one of their new transit vans about three weeks in advance because I needed to move furniture The day before I was to pick it up I called to confirm and they said the transit wasnt available but I could have a regular van But those are too short So I had to go rent a large truck from someone else at the last minute and had to pay top dollar I will not rent from Verc again
I would not recomend to anyone was late for one month as was having money issues They just cut off power without notice and asked full payment for reconnection No compassion and would advise not to take their service
Meals are not tasty or visually appealing but are quick and macro friendly for those who lead a fitness lifestyle Not enough vegetables so not micronutrient friendly
Purchased a MT coin package for NBA 2K17 Friday on a 24 hour auction I waited for 24 hours and received nothing for my purchase Was told to repost my player again for another 24 hour auction still received nothing At this point I contested the purchase through paypal and received a email from the administrator to retract my paypal dispute or I would not get a refund or the MT I purchased I made a mistake on taking back my dispute and was told to repost my player for another 24 hour auction a total wait of over 70 hours and still I have not received my purchase I am more than fed up with my experience and will just have to do with losing my money and time Please do not use this service and save yourself a unpleasant and disappointing experience

Still have not received my order I was sent an email telling me it was shipped out on feb 27 2017but I still have yet to get it in the mail No tracking info  I just want to know how much longer is the wait
This is the second time I have ordered from you and once again it was a royal pain in the neck to pace the order I kept getting a message that the COUNTRY WASNT SHOWN which it was  it said United States and I had to go back 5 TIMES AND REPEAT THE ORDER before it got through then it kept saying that I couldnt use a 500 discount on Pay Pal which I wasnt trying to do anyway The last order I placed I had to call in to place it because the shopping cart kept messing up My doctor recommended you and I would like to order at least 5 supplements per month but not if it takes me 45 minutes to place an order
delivery was missing a magnet for the cadence sensor
The company itself was great to work with however my experience was awful Bought tickets to a jlo concert in Vegas on 126 was charged a 15fee per ticket on top of the price of the tickets I didnt get the tickets had to keep calling back for them multiple times everytime I was told Id get them by the end of the week The concert was on 222 on 219 I called and finically they got a hold of the seller who then emailed me my tickets  I have never had such an awful experience no reason I should have had to wait a month for the tickets 
my cracked screen is fixed but now the touch screen is not working correctly I sent it back in and got it back in the same condition what can I do is there a warranty or guarantee on the work
called them  girl name Jason confirmed my tickets for 2287 cad I gave all info and card number  took 1 hour  after doing reservation  she said now I will get an email with confirmation I get email in 5 mints stating tickets for 2287 USD instead of 2287 cad for which I agreed
I called back to know how can they do that Girl name Igi picked the call and she told me to cancel the tickets  I told her not to charge my credit card for this amount and cancel the reservation  she confirmed me  nothing charged on your card
next thing  they charged my card for 2287 usd  I called back to know why and how can they do this on this they said you will get your money back in 10 days 
now I cant go to any where else to book my tickets before I get my money back from these fraudsters and these people wasted my 4 hours in all this process to scamming me for 2287 cad to 2287 usd and then cancelling the tickets then charging my card then telling me we cant do anything on this
please please please stay away from these creeps or keep your lawyer ready  my reservation number was 049550812 and now I am waiting to get my money back to book tickets  offcourse I have to pay high now 
THATS INCONSISTENT WITH MOST OTHER INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL CARRIERS

I will never use or recommend your cite to anyone Your cite is very miss leading About free shipping It is almost impossible to get answers to questions When I called your rep went out of her way to help and when she asked someone she was told there nothing we can do I finally got the answer to my question when I went online to find out why I have not receive the kcup coffee I ordered on 020217 Appears some of your dealers wont let a person order more than 1 item in order to charge for shipping on every item I know this review will not go on your cite Because I have written 2 times 1 time on a review

Ive been using transferwise for years and never had a problem great experience and great customer serviceactually i did a number of successful operations over the last two weeks and all went perfectly but they have lost the last 3 transfers for several thousand dollars that I did a week ago I was given the ACH traceid numbers and after speaking to my bank and to ACH I work for a bank so I can reach them easily ACH doesnt recognise those ids and dont see any incoming transfer to my account for the amounts that I did Ive got to say that so far transferwise customer service is being very helpful but I need my money to close a mortgage and no one seems to know where the money is Transferwise have reached to their banking partner so waiting to hear from them but in the meantime there several thousand dollars that I need and dont know where they are I hope that I can come back and rate the service as I would have done a week ago
Thanks

Our car caught on fire while we were driving it Not much else needs to be said really
We were put in danger by a lazy company  its outrageous that we were given a car which was clearly not safe We werent ever apologised to and lost hundreds of dollars as we missed our flights due to the accident The staff in the Picton office didnt even provide a standard form with the amount of petrol in the tank and scratches on the car recorded when we picked it up
Id never use Omega again
Not necessarily the cheapest and unlike other orders Ive placed with you the coupon offer did not come off the current order Rather it shows up in email AFTER the order has been placedto be used at a later date Thats terrible marketing just to save the company 5 Well google around to check other suppliers the next time
Very disappointed with British First we could not get the shower working engineer came on time next day Found out the fault is with the shower itself and we are not covered for it Fair enough Then on the same day our boiler was serviced by Kirk Thats where all started to be disastrous After the boiler was serviced it was making a lot of noise the next day there was no hot water at all We have young children it was so hard to jungle things around Despite I suspect my boiler was working all fine till Kirk the engineer did something with it Already frustrated since we had guest coming over we ask them if they can send someone to fix it suppose to be 24hrs service FOR them this was not an emergency we were ask that they can get someone only the next daynot to mention the guy on the phone was trying to sell and upgrade to us seriously dont you think after failing to look after your customer we would want an upgrade with you I would rather tell my acquaintance to avoid you  No option took a day off just to be told at the last minute that they have other emergencies they cant come but they will make sure someone comes tomorrow so another wasted for us Gradually the heater has stopped working as well JUST WOULD LIKE TO SAY NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL

Bought a mattress set that I had to pay in full for before it was even in Stock I was told it would be in in 24weeks 6 weeks later still no delivery I had to call and call No one answers phone No supervisor available One guy finally figured out that they had it in Stock and didnt know why no one called 3 days later a delivery guy calls in the middle of the day Im at work Says he cant deliver later because he is behind So we set up for the first delivery 2 days later Its 200pm and I am still waiting Got a hold of someone at 10am who said it would be the first delivery We have to go somewhere Youre telling me that your first delivery is after 2pm In the end I will never know if I am going to get what I bought months ago
I wanted to install an ecommerce system to a hosting plan which I bought in September It turned out the hosting plan includes a very old php version 54 it doesnt even get security fixes and they cant upgrade it They suggested to buy a new hosting plan for more money which supports php 56 Php 56 is out of active support now and it only receives security fixes
If you care about security find an alternative or dont be surprised when you get hacked on a php 54 hosting plan
I wanted to get a partial refund for the rest of my hosting plan because it is a useless junk in its current state but they refused it
I think this tells everything about the company
1 They sell a product with a huge security risk
2 To resolve it you can buy another product
3 If you dont want to but the another product then your lost your money
I think a hosting company should be
1 focusing on security
2 if something includes security risk in their infrastructure they should focus on to resolve it ASAP and not push their client to buy something else which is another junk
3 if they are not able to resolve it and the client wants their money back they should pay it back immediately
Im just wondering what happens if someone get hacked through their security issue
I have used this company 7 times for their cheap rates on 2 of the 7 times they accused me of making marks to the body of the car that I knew were already there when I picked and the staff agreed with me as it was so small however back in the office it was a different story they were happy to charge me for this new damage It was my word against theirs and I was made out to be a liar The staff were scared and were very rude it was like dealing with a criminal Customer services dismissed my claim straight away as they had their backs covered in the rental agreements I contacted the European car hire redress board who could nt help either as it wasnt cross border
I have learned not to be so trusting
Vile nasty biased evil Just evil The amount of lies and deceit brought forth by this Clinton News Network is dangerous

I have 2 experiences with CurrencyFair both bad
The problem is not just that didnt complete transfer but it took 45 days in first transaction and 30 days in second transaction to get my money back Or should say part of my money because not only I lost customers and my orders were not shipped but also I received from CurrencyFair 230 Euro less than I had sent them
Additionally they accepted was their mistake first transaction that I was charged 74 Euro but would only return them no compensation just return the 74 Euro if I accepted a total compensation of 150 Euros as good gesture for both transactions and cancel my claims to Ireland Finantial Ombudsman Otherwise nothing
This kind of blackmailing cannot be covered by any terms and conditions
They say they are faster and cheaper than banks but thats obviouslly false
The wrong item was plugged in e mails phone calls were ignored
Customer service is null and void 2 weeks later we are stuck with an unusable product

Received the wrong part then was informed it was the right part even though part number was not what I ordered was given a email address and promptly cut off Really thrilled to read the fine print that says even if we sent you the wrong part you are responsible for the 15 dollar freight charge to return this part Wont do business with this company again

After opening a can if wet dog food From tailscom I was disgusted to find bluegreen mould growing on food the inside the can
I was offered sn apology with a 156 refund
After my complaint of such a poor refund offer to resolve the issue they offered 5 off my 25 future dog food order Ive cancelled all orders and will not purchase from this company again
Buyers beware of potential contaminated dog food from tailscom
In their defense they said after an investigation it was a delivery issue but I honestly think germs entered the sealed tin can at the manufacturing stage as there were no visible puncture holes in the totally sealed tin
If there was a zero star then Id have been more than happy to select it This company used to be great but their service has gone down the drain in recent month Bad voice quality Charging for unconnected calls I was still able to put up with it because of the convenience of using their phone app The last straw was the restriction placed on my account because of a black listed IP They told me theyve fixed it but the issue still remains
You cant rely on their service for important communication It is now all about business They nickel and dime for a very poor service Im looking for an alternate provider
The storage space felt not secure The girl showing us pretty much let us see how badly run the facility was The bathroom was broken and Im pregnant

In General I was happy with Cheaptickets till the failure with the web processing which produced a flight ticket with wrong dates The reaction of cheaptickets on my request was very bad 1 it is almost impossible to find whom to write and contact in such situations 2 telophone number for Problems is expensive and always busy so no chance to contact anyone you will just pay money for waiting 3 no reaction on 34 my Messages per mail 4 no analysis of logs or smth like this 5 they send just a out of the box answer
The Support is just horrible not sure if they even understand what i am writing to them
I have the income I have the savings And I have the credit score They disapproved my loan because I make less than 100k I have been in business over 10 years and they never told me about the income requirements until after my loan was denied
I was trying to book a flight from Singapore to France and had a trouble using my debit card In short the booking was unsuccessful still you have charged me 60 I felt really bad about it charging something for deal that havent been successful Its my first time to book a flight with your site and it was a really bad experience  
If everything goes well you get average stuff at cheap prices
If anything goes wrong there is little to no customer service
My product hasnt arrived I have tried several times to get in touch with them but all have failed
They have NEVER once responded to my emails
Do yourselves a favor and dont even consider ordering from this company They get just about everything wrong They got my name the purchaser wrong the names of the gift recipients wrong inquiries from me were not answered and to top it all off although I paid for all my purchases by credit card I subsequently received a bill as if I hadnt paid at all I dont know if theyre crooks or just plain stupid but I wouldnt recommend this place to my worst enemy or maybe I would
they charged my credit card and i never received my order
when i called support they never resolved anything for me even after 15 emails and 5 phone calls i had to dispute the charges with my credit card
a complete shame on this company
I am doing this on behalf of our group booking

If you have a package that actually needs to arrive please go ANYWHERE else but Parcel Monkey Paying the extra money is worth it if you want to make sure your package arrives This is a terrible unreliable company that will lose your package and then avoid refunding your money
Customer service consists of live chat with agents in the Philippines who seem to have no idea what is going on with your package nor do they have any information other than what is on the website They also seem to have no contact with the actual Parcel Monkey center so their help is completely useless

There were no guidlines on what payment is allowed and what isnt
I tried to pay with Visa Credit card and it got rejected Looked around a guidline why it got rejected and no info was given
Took me few hours to search google where people told me that Visa gets rejected because UK does not support it
That i should try to pay with paypal
Otherwise everything went smoothly but just cause me as a customer had to do searching over the web insted of getting direct info was time costing and frustrating
This was the most difficult online experience I have ever had Fields kept filling in with data that was not necessary ie the Attention field for example The link to reset your password does not work I sent a message about that and got no response nor was it fixed The shipping charge is the same no matter how many or few you purchase Buy one bulb or 20 and its the same 993 Unfortunately this is the only place I could find that provides the type of bulb it need I bought a good supply so I never have to do business here again If I could give a minus star I would
From the beginning of the call Oscar was rude He first said he could not locate the the address and place I was calling about They only have two He called back said he had found it But they didnt have the size I wanted I asked if he was with the company I was trying to reserve with He said yes I advised site showed one left He said owe and came back and said it was available He seemed to be drunk I let my storage know what onI hope other people dont have the same issue
They do a wonderful job selling you but when it comes to submitting a claimgood luck to you Worst customer service experience All you get is months and months of puppets telling you we are really backed up try back in a week On top of thattheir claims specialist that you can only reach during their business hoursnot good when you are overseas are completely useless This girl had to have just woke up at 11am her time and didnt know a single thingand I mean she didnt know a single thing This uselessness a goes on and onits been weeks and they havent even acknowledged that they received my paperwork Every weekwe are really busy try back next week its not in my system we are busy maybe it will update next weekI should have learned my lesson when I submitted my first claim a year ago Bottom lineuse another company

Ive had Windscribe VPN for 5 months A couple days ago I used it for about an hour and when I was turning it off I was told that I had used 487mb in that session Immediately after that I went to my ISPs internet page opened my personal offices section and found out that I had used 380mb in the last 24hrs How can this be Theres no sence for
my ISP to lie to me since I have Unlimited Access plan and figures are given just to inform me Theres sence for Windscribe to cheat me that I exaust my free monthly 50gb quicker and stop loading their servers or even better buy a subscription Previously I also noticed several times that Windscribe traffic statistics were strangely high If Windscribe
isnt honest in smaller things which I believe is the case how can you trust them at alll
Yesterday I accidentally deleted my email from the Windscribe account and my limit dropped to 2gbmonth I tried to restore things and reentered the email Was told Id receive a confirmation message
After waiting for 13 hours filled a ticked This is what I got back copypasted Just letting you know that we received your support request its quite excellent one of the best ones weve seen good job
There was nothing special about my support request and the way I put it so these words are mockery On one hand Im not surprised because Im a free user On the other Im shocked at how shamelessly ugly customers are treated paid or free I believe Windscribe to be a lousy cheating rude company Who knows who they share your personal data with Think twice before using their product
Even though there are PayPal  credit card logos all over their website they dont take these payment options when shipping to some countries
I had to waste 30 minutes of my time and 30 in bank fees to pay for my shipment
Delivery was prompt but it was the wrong part I feel like I should not have to pay return shipping charges since you sent me the wrong part I probably wont be ordering from you again for this reason
Ray ban sunglasses were oblique but I keep it  didint have time to returen 
Who is checking the charges being processed I NEVER used the service and now my account has at least 8 charges for the same daytime and amount how can this occur  is NO ONE watching Who to call and discuss this situation with
GardnerWhite ran my credit 7 separate times due to poor attention to detail causing my score to dip and my monitoring company to freeze my existing accounts The furniture we have got was broken on arrival and had to be exchanged twice after initial delivery within the first month It is now broken again and the company no longer makes it due to frequent failures Jeff the corporate head of customer support was very rude and unhelpful which explains why I had issues at the store as well The best offer for resolution I got was a 50 gift certificate that expired in 6 months from date of issue
I will never do business with GardnerWhite again
very competitive price when booking online however you are hit with several additional fees and surcharges when you pick up the car which causes the price to almost doubleThese fees are not explained properly on pickup as i was told that the additional costs were for the fuel which would be refunded on dropoff which is not the case
WOULD NOT USE AGAIN
Scratched box that i have received and the Alexander wangs hat i received isnt in its best condition just wrapped in paper that i felt like someone wore it before
Poor communication with the customer service that never responded
they were rude to my bankers and to me the customer Asked too much question just to purchase my ticket with my own money they questioned me about buying a ticket for my spouse after telling them im buying a ticket for my husband they asked me the last time i deposited money in my account thats too personal Arent they selling and am i not buying i wont recommend anyone to buy their ticket with these people this lady called Debbie after telling her im grieving the death of my dad she was still rude to me and didnt give a danm about how i felt it was too much to deal with just to get a ticket Ive purchased from so many agents and never came across something like this this is the first time going through this to the extent of asking for my social security and other unnecessary things that didnt pertain to me buying a ticket from them
We ordered a ventless gas log set from WD in early December Our initial contact with the company was positive The salesperson who took our order was knowledgeable professional and courteous In addition the original shipment of our order was extremely fast
Unfortunately one of the logs arrived broken due to the poor packaging I contacted the company and they quickly placed a replacement order Awesome Until a month passes and I never hear from anyone So I call to get an update and am told I will be called back when they figure out what is going on
Two weeks pass So I call back Complete confusion like I had never originally called So I retell the story Second representative says they will get back to me with an update At this point I say Are you sure because Ive heard that before They say yes
Another week passes So I call back Same story This time I ask for a manager to contact me immediately A week later a representative emails me to let me know that they dont know when the replacement log will be here but they have sent an entire new log set Wow I think Thats pretty good at least even though it took forever
Then I receive the second log set and several pieces are broken due to poor packaging THANKFULLY the log we need is intact
The next day I receive the replacement log It is broken Not even kidding
1 Communication I found it extremely frustrating to have to be the one continuously taking initiative to figure out where our replacement order was I talked to at least two representatives on separate occasions with the promise that they would call or email me with an update with no further contact When I expressed this concern to the next agent that I spoke with there was never any obvious concern or explanation I work in organizational development and this is unacceptable customer service I only got sent to the manager at the very end
2 Shipping Both log sets that we received were lightly wrapped in bubble wrap and a layer of cardboard Having purchased extensive merchandise from Ikea I will use them as a stellar example of proper packaging for shipment Each item is wrapped in paper then plastic then high quality cardboard shaped perfectly to fit the item and sealed THEN placed into the box for shipment When researching WD initially I read many reviews giving this aspect horrible experience for those patrons whose logs arrived damaged poor ratings but chose to disregard them because the customers who received their items in good condition outweighed the others Now having been one of the others I can empathize more with their dissatisfaction We find it completely unacceptable that all 3 packages that were shipped arrived with at least 1 broken piece Any businessperson can tell you thats complete failure In addition to the level of dissatisfaction from the customers this cannot be a wise use of company resources
After this experience spanning the length of two months in its entirety I will never do business with this company again and advise you to do the same I wish I had listened to my gut the first time
Very bad to pay additional fee
online chat not workingphone not answered 11 am Tuesdayso poor customer service so far
Nothing i dont have any words to say some thing sorry
I waited all day at home on Monday for a delivery and nobody came and when I checked the package tracking online it said that there was an attempted delivery and that my address was incomplete which wasnt When I called the customer service agent was very rude and told me that they dont access apartment buildings if the receiver is not at home I told him that I waited all day for my delivery and that nobody showed up and even if the delivery man couldnt access my building they could have done what every shipping company does and leave a card with the instructions to get my package By the way I previously received a package delivered by Purolator and they left a card doswnstairs in my building so this is not new for them When I told him that the agent was even ruder and told me that this is their policy and that they dont access apartments buildingsObviously lying He aggressively offered to put my package on hold at a local Purolator store which I accepted thinking that it will be easier to finally get my products but today its Thursday and still no call from them I am very disappointed and frustrated by this situation and I hope that I will not have to deal with this company again
The day they said they would deliver they did not and did not contact us The next day we just missed them so we had to reschedule and pay a fee Then on the second attempt they do didnt give us a time so we had to be home all day until about 500 pm when the driver finally showed up
I asked several times if the storage space had outside access from a rollup door not an inside corridor NOT TRUE  there was only access from inside narrow hallways The agent at the location told me this happens all the time  promises are made that cannot be capped
I wish there was an option to rate less than 1 So placed an order01711047 on feb 4th here and never got a confirmation email Called on feb 5th to see whats going on and the guy Completely unprofessional said we are going to deliver less flowers and chocolates instead cake I was like why did you let me order then and even if you did you should have contacted me with that info Today feb 6th on the delivery date nothing got delivered I will surprised if someone actually reads this review as I was calling the helpdesk this morning and no one picked up Worst experience ever I was very reluctant on using sites to send gifts to India and now I know why
Overpromised but underdeliver Prices increase every year internet connection unstable promised to connect internet earlier but waited for weeks Unapologetic and rude customer service Please do not sign their contract and get tied up to them There are better and cheaper alternatives out there such as Drei and A1 Do your homework and compare the different companies Do NOT sign up for UPC just because of their ads in Austria
I ordered a red velvet cake for my twin sons 18th bday their favorite I paid 5435 for what turned out to be the tiniest most pathetic cake youve ever seen There was barely enough for 5 tiny pieces I was mortified  so upset that this ruined my sons bday I will NEVER order from this place again  will let everyone know about my experience so they dont make the same mistake I did

SpareFoot found us what sounded like a good deal  until we got the paperwork and found out there was an administration fee that had not been mentioned  and until we got to the storage facility and found out there was no unit available in the size we had reserved It was a waste of time
I returned the item because it was too small The item was perfect and very quick delivery but I returned it over 3 weeks ago and still no refund
Totally rude poor service I cancelled order in the end Rude is all I can say when I asked what exactly they were sending out for me Couldnt tell me after days of trying to get the order correct Would not deliver when someone was home 3pm was to late  Most people work and for a 3000 to Deliver 20 minutes outside of town I felt they should make an effort This lady I was sending the flowers to lost her father on Monday I ordered on Monday and yes Monday was a holiday so should have gone out Tuesday and it is Friday and still no flowers Called another company and they will be delivered today Friendly and very obliging
I am not sure how you can ask me about my satisfaction when I never received my order
We were told that there were 6 off of the sale price along with they would pay the 6 sales tax We picked out a mattress that was on sale for 699 and was promised the 6 off of that We had to leave once they got the paperwork done So hurriedly had to go Once we got home we were sold a 799 mattress  And with all we bought 3 piece sectional matttessand a bed frame NOTHING was 6 off Went back to get adjustment and told nothing can be done Will NEVER recommend this place  Yall knew we needed to leave and got us for 3500

Just received a Tripadvisor Customer Survey for Owners I filled in the fields honestly Some good some bad Tabbed to go to next page but it wouldnt load Tried a few times but still wouldnt load Hmmm
Went back to the beginning and filled in all the fields with top marks Low and behold the next page loaded Whats the point of asking for a survey if you wont accept constructive criticism You set the questions
Of course I and many owners know the reason You can simply say to Owners Guests and the Press We have just carried out an extensive survey and the positive feedback received was so overwhelming we are continuing on the path of ruination deceitfulness back handed dealings and Fk All of You attitude Kind Regards The Tripadvisor Team
I buy these workout clothes for my daughter to encourage her tremendous success in losing weight and getting fit She lives the outfits The selection is quite limited and I find the website to be slow and clunky For example I closed and relaunched it four times in order to place my order today The solidly signs are red often on red prints and very small hard to see Theres no option in outfits to say Capri pants with high waist and t shirt or bra top for example Site locks up frequently on my iPad

You told us to refund a part of the money we had already paid You never did it I hope you do it this week or ill finally report it
For the second time there seemed to be an issue with their website It makes you think your order did not go through so you repeat the steps and it goes right thru Than you get double the order and when I contacted them I was told it was my fault and that I would need to pay for shipping it back and pay them a 10 restock fee for their error The first time I placed an order and this same issue occurred I realized what had happened and called to let them know I only needed one flag This time I did not catch it One has to wonder is it set up to do this on purpose What are the odds
lack of professionalism
this was probably the biggest waste of times I entered all my books on the site which gave me a total of 25 back I understand everything may not be accepted but they emailed me saying i will be getting 6 back because some of my books were not acceptable because they were in poor condition which was FALSE because I inspected each and every book and they were PERFECT I sent one book in a binder because it came loose leaf they kept my binder and sent me back the papers in a rubber band The receipt they sent was noted for an Art  Painting book which all I sent was History Philosophy  Keyboarding So the book listed was not even mine I emailed them twice with my experience and no one emailed me back so terrible customer service TRUST ME PEOPLE DONT DO THIS JUST DONATE YOUR BOOKS
I purchased my child car seat from here as this was the best price I could find online In retrospect I would have happily paid more and purchased through somewhere like Amazon and had better service
I was promised a delivery date which was missed on 3 occasions I made 3 phonecalls to the company to chase my order The least amount of time I was on hold for was 20 minutes They seem to have one customer service repand they only work 105 and take an hour for lunch where you cannot contact them
Absolutely none of my emails were answered The only was I finally had a resolution was through Google as they protected the order All in all absolutely awful company no concept of customer service Place your business elsewhere

Shop assistant who served us had little or no knowledge off the product we purchased He read the main features of the product which was written on the display product box in from of us  Luckily I had done some homework on the products prior to entering the shop
Also he advised me that they were out of stock of the product we required and had to advise him that there was some products left and they were stored on the floor underneath the display model
On a positive the shop assistant was pleasant and friendly

I found AdAware inadequate in operation It failed to find several very simple malware type ads It took several runs of AdAware to finally remove all that were found in the initial scan Each scan did remove some that were found But not all Several scans finally did the job
Then I found it very difficult to uninstall AdAware from my computer Again several tries and it finally disappeared

I was very disappointed I just wanted to send a gift token to my son in Sydney and trusted that this would be simple and without complication
Instead I found it very easy to spend my A100 but my son did not receive the token and I received no confirmation that it had been sent I think that I have now traced the token and I think that he will eventually receive it  but it will be three weeks after his birthday instead of a week before Also I found it difficult and very time consuming trying to work out how to trace what had happened
Having previously had so many good reviews of Wiggle and some good experience I was disappointed

Hi
Unfortunately we are highly disappointed with our order tonight and the wait times I had purchased a large pizza and the contents of this was cold and sauce was overloaded dripping all over the floor The pasta was dry and also cold in the middle so not saucy at all and the Garlic bread burnt Very long wait times aswel was going to get this delivered paid for it online and the wait time was 1 hour 40 minutes far too long to wait with kids so had to go in and pick it up and noticed on the window it stated staff wanted delivery drivers and Junior staff Was unsure if understaffed hence waiting this long We paid 46 all up and highly disgusted with what we received Seeking a refund paid online via eat nowIt definately was not worth the money and food was put in the bin as it wasnt cooked and as it was full of cheese and chicken couldnt risk food poisoning as we have young childrenWe had requested delivery as our familys down with the flu Please refund our money was such a disappointing experience and we now have to seek other food as we are hungry We are regular customers so im not sure whats happened I have logged a refund with Paypal

From first till last moment everything was unacceptable I recommend no one to use this company 
All my 3 orders were delivered days late
Car was very nice clean Customer service wasnt great at all The person that checked me in wasnt nice at all Vercs rental policies are not inline with what other car rental companies are doing If you dont sign up for their insurance theyll charge you a 1000 security deposit seems a bit extreme Also if you need to extend your rental you have to return to the facility and go through the whole process that you initially did when renting the car not a very customer service orievtated company I wont be doing business with them again
I booked a room for 7 nights payed for it in a hotel I knew was good On the weekend before my trip I received an email telling me my booking was cancelled and my money was returned No support to call on Sunday and my trip started Monday Finally Monday I got contact from the help center and there was nothing they could do So I had to call every where for a room before my flight left and ofcourse the Hotel I had booked previously was almost double the price I had to change to another Hotel and still had to pay more than before All this before my flight I will never use this service again No help on rebooking just uups were sorry I would not recommend using this service to anyone
The website seems to be faulty I use a Macintosh so that may be one of the problems I made all the choices offered but they apparently were not saved by the system The site took my payment A day later I received an email saying that I needed to say what two choices were I responded Then another email came asking for more information on choices I replied A third email followed The next day another person emailed from the same email address basically saying the same thing the first person was communicating I was happy to learn that the labels are the size of a thumbnail I thought the size on the website was the actual size Good thing this was clarified
Awful experience ever Am not sure what the people below are talking about Save your money time and sanity and book even with flight centre or whatever do not use this company Had to cancel a flight due to medical reasons and was told a refund could be processed only if one of us was dead and this from a supervisor
Please do not book with these company
Danke nie wieder
On February the 5th I got my paypal blocked as I reached the limitations of 2500
As my account was open under my artist name  I unsuccefully asked many times to change it even providing all the documents requested I couldnt lift the limitations After 2 working weeks 1012 days and a considerable amount of money spent to contact the irelandbased costumer care I have been told to relax and wait for the transfer of my balance 719 to my new PayPal account fully verified and open under my real name Mind you this account is the one I opened around 2012 before moving to a foreign country and complaining with the terms of use opening a new account there Slovenia After another 3 days I received the standard mail that explained to me the total blockage of my money and presented my a request for a proof of address that has been provided 3 times using a phone bill a ID card and a utility bill Still probably I will have to wait the customary 180 days My small business is ruined and I am seriously disappointed They didnt even release my credit card I tried to be cooperative and to atone for my original mistake about the artist name fake name for paypal to no avail It seems they almost enjoy seeing people struggle against their draconian set of rules only because located in Luxembourg they are protected under certain laws Freezing money is apparently legal in the small landlocked country
Please dont use PayPal Transfer your money frequently Treat them as the con corporation they actually are Dont trust what they tell you
It is an uphill battle
Next time I will be as criminal so they are considering me moving my money out as soon as the first notification about reaching the limit hit me And I will close the account
As I guess a lot of sellers are forced to doI will spare you the meaningless and utterly confusing protection offered to buyers They basically ask the seller to ship the item without receiving the money he earned for 21 days
Never again Oh their English is sometimes sloppy too
I normally dont post reviews but I am today Beware that if you decide to go with Five9 that your billing starts immediately even if it takes them 68 weeks to get your phone system up and running
Once the system was up and running it works as expected
The rep who took my call said they had a storage unit that would fit the height of motorhome When I arrive the person at the counter said theres no way any of their units were tall enough for a motorhome We went out and confirmed that just to be sure It was a complete waste of my time SelfStoragecom is just a leads generating company not an actual storage company I think the rep probably gets bonuses for leads and didnt care if it fit or not
Although the clothes look really nice and I am excited to recieve them I kept having problems at checkout It would not let me use my normal school address so I had to change it to my home one Then it kept telling me that I was outside of the contiguous United States and charged me an extra dollar for shipping no matter what address I used Very annoying and very tedious If this happens next time I try to order I will not be continuing my membership
Very unhappy with size of Waterford Crystal bowl its a third of the size advertised on website Rose Boyle
Please stop your activities What is your added value 
What is the point of sending out emails saying that somebody has responded to feed back that has been left and when you click on the link it tells you that this link has expired
I ordered one bento box and it never showed up I got a email confirming that it had arrived but I never got it The whole process was very confusing because of all the other emails saying that it did and did not arrive
Everything I really wanted was out of stock in the cute prints in my size xxl Then you did not give VIP prices on two tops I ordered
I was trying to order a Jadore signature set as a birthday present for my sister The ordeal started with placing the order online After trying several times the order did not go through and I was prompted to call the customer service The customer service rep could not resolve the problem even after trying 3 different credit cards I use regularly His response was there is a conflict in my address I eventually managed to place the order online myself The order arrived a day late Once opened by my sister we realized that the set is missing and they have only sent us the complementary samples while they had charged my credit card i called the customer service and the rep first asked if i still had the original packaging Then he said they had to place an inquiry to UPS that takes 510 business days followed by an internal inquiry I told him that there was no point in contacting UPS as I had received the package but it was missing the actual order He did not understand how idiotic his proposed course of action was and at the end said there was no other way around it I demanded either a replacement sent right away or my money back and he refused I demanded to speak to his supervisor He put me on hold forever I called again later that day and spoke to the same person This time he said that they would not charge my credit card but offered no explanation or apology for this mess The charge kept showing as pending for several days on my credit card account Bottom line terrible experience terrible website terrible customer service Do not waste your time with these people
They will not answer their phone and wont return email messages I paid extra for 2nd day FedEx but after a week have not received the order I have a feeling that this company has gone under but is still taking peoples money My next step is to go to my bank and file a dispute which I will do tomorrow Very frustrating to have to fork out more money To get my supplies
Difficult to print gift card  would have preferred email option Kept telling me long running scripts Had I not already paid would have given up
I ordered a size large was sent a medium shirt I know I can return it I still want the shirt but in the right size I wont get the discounts I had before Just ugh
There is no guest checkout You HAVE to sign up for an account This wastes my time like I have noting better to do than waste 15 minutes signing up I dont understand why it is so difficult to spend my money
Wanted me to pay for the furniture up front and i was gonna have to wait a month on deliveryNO THANKSi went somewhere else and got better furniture

I purchased an item that is not returnable unless defective The product was defective and will not charge I contacted Groupon for help getting a return label They were of no help
I have used Bake Me a Wish before without any problem I ordered a carrot cake for my motherinlaw for her birthday They sent a peanut butter chocolate cake instead She said it was very good Since carrot cake is her favorite I was disappointed
Contacted them several times to prove that the blackjack is RNG based refused and wouldnt prove any hashes to hands
First they confirmed the reservation by email with the wrong dates After having that streightened out on October 6 2016 I confirmed by email to proceed with the rental and requested that it include the extra insurance and extra driver This should have been covered with a Full Rate package at 77284 Euros However When I picked up the car on January 15th the attendant told me that they had reserved it under the basic rate and that the cost now for the full insurance extra driver and petrol will now cost me 81349 At the time of pick up on January 15 2017 I had just arrived from a 12 hour flight and did not have the email showing that I had requested on October 6 2016 what should have been booked as a Full rate When I returned the car they told me that they could not help me and that I should email them when I got home Two emails later no reponse
Also although I requested a GPS the attendant failed to advise me that the model car I rented included a GPS and therefore I did not need to rent one at an extra cost of 60 Euros I only noticed the GPS in the car when I arrived in Nerja and could not return the one that I rented also no response from my emails
We will be returning to Malaga in the future but will not deal with Malagacar

BUYER BEWARE
Love the products hate the return process Receiving the RMA prior to returning an item takes too long and could be accomplished online much quicker
Drlig pridukter
My item didnt work and the return process is highly difficult I will never buy anything from this place again
Great boots super comfy buy with confidence from Uttings Very fast delivery too thanks
Im sorry when you send email out of the blue for no reason stating
Your review of allivetcom has been flagged by our software or our Compliance Team because weve been unable to verify the authenticity of it
when I included the order  and date of order in the review then you call me a liar
FY
See I put my order  in the review so the only way you could not verify the review is that you think I lied about the order 
I would not trust any rating from this site on any company
Worse you will likely remove this review because you are nasty cheats like that
Note I gave allivet 5 stars For some reason this company is targeting other companies The only thing I want from a company is to get what I order when I order it Give me that and you are a 5 star Screw it up but fix it right away with out issues and you are a 5 star
allivet no drama
trustpilot nasty back stabbing  that is nothing but worthless drama and no respect the guy sending out emails about dead relatives in Nigeria is more respectable than trustpilot
Even if they fix this issue they still called me a liar and I will never trust their reviews on any comapny
I got a call 10 minutes before I was supposed to pick my car up saying that there were no cars available I was already at the car centre to collect my car

Over a week ago I ordered a Pax 3 and a half pack oven lid Shortly after I placed the order I received email that the oven lid was out of stock and my order would not be shipped until it came it I waited a couple days to respond just in case the item came in and the order was shipped Then I responded to the email to just ship the Pax 3 I received a response with a case number but no actual response to my email Again being a patient person I waited a day but since I was on a gift deadline I then used the chat function to contact them The agent of course was very nice and told me the Pax 3 would be shipped right away Nope After waiting 24 hours I contacted them again via the chat function and was told it had not made it for that days shipping Since it was Friday that meant it wouldnt be shipped until Monday  two days before I need it The agent was able to get the shipping upgraded to express so I MAY get it before the birthday  well see And then I got this email asking for my opinion Seriously
5 stars Worst domain hosting company out there stay away Believe me if you really thing that you are going to save some small amount by doing business with onecom then think again I can tell you that you are more at a risk of damaging your domain by choosing your domain host at onecom  We had problems with 4 domains out of 25 NB all domains were configured with the same settings For some reason 4 domains did not work accordingly with the other 21 that were working Made one test and moved one domain to another host and guess what it worked DNS settings at onecom is a CRAP and their support are a bunch of special people
I liked the website user friendly easy to modify search and see all available deals
However the flight I wanted which was always showing up when I refreshed the search was not available when I selected it There was a popup telling me to call a 1800 number which I did I waited on the line just to get a confirmation that that price was not available
Bills appear high from the previous supplier I will be reviewing it soon
They steal your money Even if you cancel and dont make use of their service It is how thieves operate They do not listen to whatever you have to say and want to take your money Do NOT make use of this company
I could not understand AAG employee Maria Lopez on the telephone during one of our conversations and asked her if I could speak with someone else She called me a racist and hung up
Very professional The only thing I was upset about was no discounts for booking on line or free room for staying at least 6 days This was a practice in the past I am a repeat customer for many years
I typed in the model number for the GE Range and got the code for a replacement Oven bake element I ordered the part and it arrived quickly but looked nothing like the old part The replacement part is clearly meant to be used for a different range of models but it does not work for mine even though the web site claimed it was a compatible part DONT BE FOOLED BY THEIR RETURN POLICY This company is a bad I placed an order online and I received the wrong product It turns out to be my problem and send it back and PAY THE SHIPPING ON ME ONLINE ORDERS ARE NOT BACKED BY THEIR RETURN POLICY I am paying the damn shipping to send it back and will never order another product from this place AGAIN ORDER FROM A MORE TRUSTED AND RELIABLE COMPANY
Quick turn around but the Kinesthetic tape was next to useless
Didnt stick well and came off very easily Dont go with their own brand spend the extra and get something decent
This is my 1st time using this service if not for the amazingresponsive RV owner I would not use Outdoorsy again
I sent a request to Outdoorsy Customer Service asking to amend the date range error on my reservation prior to paying the down payment but never received a response The RV owner had to call them herself to get it fixed after waiting a few days without any response
I also dont like the fact I can only pay my reservation in full when I initially pay my down payment ora few days prior to my depatrure having the flexibily to pay in full at any time would be nice
This is the second time that your flowers I order have been nearly dead after a day I dont think I will order with you again If I put my faith in you to deliver lovely flowers for a special occasion and you let me down

We booked rixos belek by them and now they called me and say the hotel is not available but we can have another hotel for that in place But that one we dont want because we been there and we want the other one that we booked and payed for
The prices they give you are good but they can book you in another hotel
UPDATE We can book Rixos Belek on the website with the same date and same nights for the same price and they told us we cannot have that room but it is still available at their site
I ordered a package on the 18th February as a birthday present for my mother so she could have it at the beginning of march on her birthday I choose the delivery option which got the parcel delivered within 5 working days Which would have got there in plenty of time It is now the 10th March and I have yet to receive his parcel I have sent 2 tickets in to the site and have received a automated response back which did not answer my questions at all and just said to wait until the 18th March I need this issue resolved as soon as possible because my mother has gone without a birthday present and I have paid for this and paid for delivery But the Customer Service system is making it very difficult and here has been no update on the tracking system since the 21st February Very disappointed as I was looking forward to ordering from this website again but after his incident I dont think I will be
Ive booked a hotel with AMOMA and had to make a first name only change to booking AMOMA were able to take all of my money at booking but due to amendment policy Which is not clear on their website I was unable to change booking Furthermore they do not disclose their suppliers Dont book with them

Will not be using them again
To expensive Im sorry Im not going spend half of my working money on Ssense Very sorry
Moneyoff discounts dont seem to work on this site despite them being advertised as currently valid Also Marvin have no power to force the restaurants to give you good customer service other than passing negative comments given back to their members which they probably immediately file in the round file So its all very hit and miss You never know what youre going to get with each order Had a few good experiences and a few bad experiences Nothing is standard unfortunately PayPal is very handy to have as a payment option but theyll charge you 150 on your order for using it Considering the food isnt cheap anyway and often youll pay quite a high delivery fee theres really nothing here that you cant get with Just Eat I dont order enough to be bothered about their loyalty stamp thing By the time youve spent all that money through them getting a free meal is the least that could be done for you in return Not too enamoured with the whole thing to be honest
I ordered Slate blue bedsheets but I got Micro Chip grey color
I purchased a 12hour lvl100110 boost and was assured it would be complete within the timeframe After the 12hour mark they notified me on skype that the boosting hasnt started yet Then became annoyed with my questions over skype I personally dont mind the delay things happen But when they became annoyed with my questions on timeframe is when I asked for a refund I dont suggest using this website for your boosting
They are cheating dont buy your ticket with Travelgenio They stole 300eruos from my bank account
I dont feel that the ordered items were the quality that I expected
Stay way clear no customer service paid for a site to be developed by partner  Template Tuning in Jan 2017 its April Not a single bit of work done

What an embarrassment the state of the hotel room in this hotel Filty shower mat  scum marks all around the baththe floor are filty stain Not worth the price what we paying for
You cant get through to ANY of the telephone numbers on the internet and they dont reply to emails 
I have an urgent issue with a ticket for one of my staff members and cannot get through to sort it out
I am booking tickets every day I wont be using Tripsta again
Item was bought and sent using 7 day shipping method
It is coming up to 1 month without the tracking number being updated or item received Local post store says item never made it into the country NZ but wiggle are taking minimal action Refusing to refund or send another item if replying at all
Watch out
Buy elsewhere
this is the second time ordering from this company and they have taken 2 weeks to dispatch items clearly showing as in stock on both occasions customer service said read the small print will not be using again
I bought 2 shirts wrong size so my fault I tried to exchange them but Fanatics says they do not do exchanges I would have to return them
Not a problem I thought I had subscribed to a free trial of Shoprunner who advertised Free Shipping and Free Returns for 30 days
I used the Shoprunner return label but Fanatics still charged me a 550 fee for using The FANATICS LABEL
I guess they value 550 more than a chance at my repeat business

I booked a Sunset Deluxe Pool access Room at The Graceland Resort in Phuket with TravelOnline It all seemed to go through until i received a call the following morning to inform me verbally that only the Deluxe pool access room in the Graceland wing Which is considerably older not the Sunset wing was available I was told that i was required to book it on line and that she was unable to make the booking I immediately booked the room that once again I was told verbally was available it all went through yet again until I received an email an hour later thats right ONE HOUR LATER stating that they had attempted to call me Funny as I didnt have a missed call The email informed me that they were sorry this room was sold out alternatively they have a POOL VIEW room available If I book this room tomorrow morning they could have me in a broom closet
My mother was booked into a deluxe room I have since cancelled her room with the hotel and its cost me over 400
If you dont have the software to show potential holidayers that your rooms are not available you have no right claiming that you are experts at anything
My code is not working
Life proof is horrible When I first bought the Case everything was fine then about a week into it no one could hear what I was saying with it on I would constantly have to take it on and off to make phone calls Then while I was sitting down my phone shatters while in my back pocket right on the camera Life proof sucks Just get the regular otter box and dont waste your money like I did
The personal of costumer service in Madrid is very poor they dont have a professional person for attention they dont have experience for the each item problem

I purchased a Givenchy purse as a gift
After a few weekused only a few times the screw was loose from one side and eventually falls out The recipient emailed SSENSE with the issue but advised us to find a cobbler to fix and reimburse
This isnt really an after service and leaves the customer to go and fix on their own
It is unfortunate that we received a bag that had a defect
Lloyd
I love Temple and Webster and I dont like saying anything negative but unfortunately I have not received this item A bit disappointed
Simply put the download didnt work
The product did not meet the promised specification
Ive had 2 instances of notsogood customer service with this company
I was extremely excited to order my case but when I received it it looked nothing like the picture I ordered a case that had stars on a clear backrgound But in real life the transparent looking background was UGLY and white not at all transparent The case itself was cheap and tacky The print is PIXELATED and NOT glossy like it claims to be I cant believe I paid 50 Australian dollars for this
So i contacted them wanting a refund which means I have to pay for return shipping which I was unimpressed about So they organised a replacement free of charge
The second time around I ordered something with a full print so they wont be able to screw up and send me a white background when it should be CLEAR But of course they screw up again and this time send me an iPhone 6 case NOT iPhone 7 I have just sent them a message again letting them know they have sent the wrong item What are they going to do this time send me another case Maybe third time is a charm
ONLY BUY FROM THIS SITE IF YOU WANT TO BE DISSAPOINTED
We had an emergency and the agent charged us over 300 more than the flight would have been if we just booked with the airline and hounded us to post this comment
I ended up paying 3 times the amount I was supposed to pay according to my online booking
Very very abnoxious and disnohest behaviour a the pick up from the staff they were writing down by hand all this stupid prices on a piece of paper increasing the original amount booked online I felt beeing in a illegal street business with bargainers
They tried to charge me an extra for the under 25 years old policy but Im 27
I just received an email they dont refund the full deposit as apparently I returned the van delayed which is totally wrong because I flew out at 7pm and they told me I returned it at 8 pm
What a bunch of liars and dishonest people
Worst Company never
RUN AWAY
Ordered flowers 2days before a funeral Ordered for our family members
The time of delivery was at 900AM We didnt see the flowers at the service I tracked them on the website it said it was in delivery this was at 1200 PM I called was on hold for a total of thirty minutes during the waiting  my call was disconnected 3 times I talked first with a tired sounding woman who sounded like she was just waking up she said something and the phone disconnected I called back waited another 10 minutes finally man answered tried to review how to place an order at this point I was so frustrated I asked to talk to a manager so I was again put on hold the same man told me the flowers were delivered by UPS at 1100 AM the funeral was over Whats the point of having flowers deliver after the funeral Well in the end they said they would issue a full refund and a gift card we will see if they follow through The gift card will not be needed
One month I wrote the review below For some reason it has dissapered from Trustpilot  I wonder why I still havent recieved my product or my money Imagine having a shop selling nothing for high prices This is quite a breilliant idea

I ordered a GPS 25 November 2016  when it hadnt arrived to me by early December I filed in a message on their website that I hadnt received my product After some correspondence and a second attempt I was told that it was lost in delivery and the transporter would have to search for it If they found it I would receive it
Today  2 months after I havnt heard anything so I decided to call their customer service I was told that they were still searching and if they found the product they would send it to me If not I would get a refund I told them that I was not interested in a refund but just to get the product  I did not order it for fun I actually need it The reply was sorry we cant do this  company policy
Im not sure if I ever will see my money again  lucky for me it was just a small amount But I am sure that I will never use this company again You who read this shouldnt either
The navigation of the website isnt user friendly and maybe is causing damage to the marketing of the products I just order the product lets see how is the quality
I bought a new ASUS A6420 all in one computer last july and have had a number of problems sinceWhilst i can understand that computers can break down i would expect the best efforts to remedy the problems
With the computer shutting down regularly I brought it back and Elara installed updates and gave it backproblem recurredi was told that if the problem was software it would not be covered and i would have to paythankfully screen eventually showed that the Hard disc was faulty and I sent it back and the disc was replacedI was without the computer for a few weeks but at least the problem was found or so we thoughtA few days after its return the same thing happened againOn enquiring about a new computer I was told that ASUS have to try to repair it 3 times before this can happenThe computer is back with them for over 2 weeks and still no newsMy whole experience with Elara and ASUS has been very poor and as such i would be reluctant to do business with them again
Initially the deal was priced at 1999
Then another email tells me you want another 2999 and directs me to the last paragraph in the faqs where pre order and the real price reveals itself
I was about to complain to nochex for breach of FSC guidelines as well as my credit card company

I have used on 3 different occasion Delayed payment by 5 days twice and this time after five days of waiting I rang and they told me that my payment has been cancelled and will go back on to my deposit account I asked them why as i have made a payment to this exact same account on 3 previous payments and they said they could not give me a reason Very unhappy as waiting on money which is in no mans land for 5 days and could not use
Not sold that was advertised
We have booked tickets about a month ago for a chile football game tomorrow and still have not received them They verified our payment and took the money straight away but now have gone silent on us when we have tried contacting them about the tickets for tomorrow They arent in our spam or anything either
DO NOT USE
I cant believe how long I had to wait for just for rebooting a simple flight every time she would take information she placed me on hold for at least 25 min  Never booking with them again
I purchased an expensive watch and was not satisfied with it I feel the least this company could do is offer an exchange The background of the Rolex watch is meteorite and I was advised by customer service to look at one in a store before ordering yet the one I received from Worlds Best looked VERY different Again it would have been nice if they offered a return on an item that was not even removed from the packaging
The choices were great however the disclaimer for making changes within 24 hours is incorrect The flight must be cancelled and repurchased which may lose the requested flights Also when asking for a supervisor I was not connected to one
Booking travel for a business trip to Cologne and selected 1st class as offering free seat reservation This would allow me to sit next to a colleague and plan for the business trip ahead At no point in the booking process was I able to select my seat so presumed I would be able to do this after making paymentnot the case
I telephoned customer support who advised that there is no option to select your seat when making an online booking and that I now had 3 options speak to the train manager on the day ask another passenger to move or pay an extra 47 to change my seatyou are joking
Its a good job the customer support lady who answered the phone was very friendly and polite otherwise I would have vented all my frustration You dont make their jobs easy
One would think it common sense the functionality to select a seat would be built in to the online booking process but no So if you want to reserve a seat book your ticket over the phone
I ordered on 214 with a promised shipment date of 228 I get an email later on asking me for my shipping address again as they must have lost it After quite a bit of back and forth they finally ship on 321 nearly a month after it was promised At that point the price has dropped elsewhere
Im still waiting for my product to arrive

Airbnb had a listing for home in Bay St Louis which included amenities like housekeeping The host accepted my request then told me I would have to clean the home AND pay the housekeeping fee of 100 so her housekeeper could inspect my work The HOST did not comply with her advertisement so I retracted my reservation request
Airbnb charged me a service fee of 65 and refused to reimburse me stating thats i should have read the details of the rental and that it included a housekeeping fee They ignored my explanations that the service would NOT be provided In addition Shenae the host was baffled that i would object to paying 100 for cleaning that I was expected to perform
I recently bought a 3 pack Ink cartr The 1 black one I installed has no ink in it I reinstalled my old one and I could print as usual It just shows she is low I will shortly install the 2 black one from you and see if that works

I ordered on February 9 and received a confirmation on February 10 that my flowers would be delivered on February 14 On February 11th they stated that they could only deliver 6 roses instead of 18 due to high prices I told them I didnt care how much they had to pay I expected them to deliver the agreed upon product They didnt deliver anything I plan on calling my credit card company and reversing the charge
I bought cable temple frames and the temples were too short Called to have them resized and personnel on the phone were prompt and customer service was excellent They authorized a return and promised to switch out the temples for the larger size I had to pay the shipping and insurance cost back to Frames Direct 1150 The glasses were returned in a reasonable amount of time it was a new frame as promised but it was the same size as the previous So I have a beautiful pair of glasses that still dont fit right and my plan is to move on as I cannot pay 1150 each time an adjustment is needed I likely will not do this again
They have no stock  they ship directly from the manufacturer The website says 15 days but I finally got my tracking number and it does not deliver until next week  3 weeks from ordering Do yourself a favor and get form Amazon  you will get the item in 2 days if you have Prime
Hired a car through Ryanair Cartrawler who are agents for GOLDCAR in Alicante
After a 60 minute wait I eventually got served by an abrupt agent who debited my credit card 1500 Euros instead of just blocking it for this amount It was only after a few days into my holiday when I checked my credit card statement to find it was accruing interest and had to drive a 200 Kilometres round trip all the way back to the airport to have it refunded as you cannot get them on the telephone
On picking up the car in their dimly lit car park on level 2 large scratches on the drivers door were pointed out to me on the check list I couldnt see any more so accepted this and drove off I returned the car after seven days in the same condition as I picked it up to the check in desk again in the dimly lit car park on level two and the agent checked the car and said all was OK
Now the nightmare on returning to the UK I checked my credit card again only to find they had debited 28228 for scratches to the bumper I was livid and sent an email immediately to their customer services they were not interested and said the charges would remain I will not let this fraud go without a fight so have copied my 100 emails to their CEO Juan Cazcona waiting for an apology
Steer Clear of GoldCar They rip you off
An arrangement was sent to me for my mothers memorial and the florist delivered it to the wrong location The original arrangement was never located and the florist replaced it with what l felt was an inferior arrangement and not worth the 60 paid I attempted to resolve this through teleflora and their response was basically that they wouldnt work with me the buyer would need to contact them I didnt want to upset the person who sent the arrangement but I am still trying to get teleflora to step up and make this right
The beanie i reveived was great but the security tag was left on the gym sack so 7 wasted not happy
Have fun waiting days for them to send you a generated response
I was sold a ticket with a total cost of 89 pounds the ticket arrived as a Junior Im an Adult ticket priced at 564 this was not stated regardless of what they say 
The club have 100 hundred percent guranteered I will not gain access with the ticket as it has been void I will be contacting the the police to take this matter further as advised by the club
The ticket holder is currently under investigation for ticket touting I want a full refund
They made it next to impossible for me to delete my account
They dont easily allow you to delete work you submit even if your work did not win the contest
If my name was googled the work would show up and often times submitting to design contests youre obviously not going to put your best effort in so to not waste your time if it doesnt get chosen
Either way crowdsourcing design is a cheap and a huge disrespect to designers and their industry Build a relationship with a designer keep that designer
I never got my order after waiting almost two months Finally I requested a refund No customer service telephone number Everything has to go through email mail back  forth The web link they sent me to withdraw  refund has a button withdraw but it doesnt work no matter how many times u click it Will never order again from this companyeverything comes from china it seems and I never got my order
i paid 20 pound for the flowers the girl was leaving she was very upset with the flowers i did complain and they advised they will bloom they look more like garage shop flowers than anything
I ordered 5 fruit trees last year and all of them died I told them early on that they looked like they were dead but they insisted on me scraping the trunk for a couple of months They questioned my planting but I followed their directions exactly So they agreed to send me replacement trees provided I pay another 125 Since I had already invested about 800 I agreed to do it So I received the new set of trees in February and planted them To date it looks like 2 out of the 5 are also dead This is a very unreliable company I will not be paying them another dime
hi
We have been using Hotelscomexpedia etc good search engines but for some reason while booking from Triavago we got Amomacom with great prices soo got tempted  booked our hotels in Tokyo through them
First sign of fraud was when we called the hotel to confirm our booking we were told that the room we booked does not reflect on their booking we got a small room though we paid for a double standard
Secondly they claim they are 247 available but there is no response to any calls or emails
Thirdly when you book there is instant confirmation with the money going out but when you cancel there is a message which says it has gone to the customer service  they will revert back 
This totally reflects a scam as now i am worried whether i am going to get my money back at allIs there any way they can be charged with fraud
Did not receive everything I ordered so I am not happy with the service at all cant seem to answer any questions either
very poor performance
Justdont Horrible support servers are a joke and frustrating config settings
The equiptment was a week later than promissed when they finally came to install the floor mats I ordered with my home gym where missing several piecesas of 3172017 still waiting on remainder of floor matsNo discount no nothing The warehouse manager seems a bit incompetent to have dropped the ball twice To top it off I received a call from the wharehouse on 3142017 to confirm a deliver for 3172017 for a spin cycle I didnt order but what made it annoying was the caller insisted that was the order the only thing that save them from me not cancelling the whole order the sale on the equipment I purchased Otherwise they need a consultant to come in and train management on how to satisfy customers when there are issues with an order
We arrived at Coolangatta on a late flight 930 pm Once we cleared customs etc We headed to pick up our rental I was really frustrated and exhausted we had to wait another 15 to 20 minutes because the red spot counter was NOT manned While every other rental car firms had people on their counters Finally when the lady turned up she had been yakking in another part of the airport When we explained how long we had been waiting she became very aggressive and said well you people were not due to arrive and pick up the car until 1000 pm Rather than split hairs and be more understanding her entire attitude toward us has left a bitter taste in my mouth Would I use this company again NO I think not
Do not shop at this company They do not give you what you pay for The customer service was terrible in the three departments I spoke with If you want a horrible experience however they will exceed your expectations
After a regular ended rent in Sardinia for only 1 day I have not received back the deposit on my card
The rent ended absolutely regularly
In the contract is written that deposit will be refunded after end of rent NOTWHENEVER IT MAY LIKE TO RENTALCARS
This is not fair And answering that in 10 working days it should came back is not the right way to deal with costumers
Blocking 900 euros for an uncertain time and based upon factors not in control of the company is simply the reason why you should NOT ever rent from them
8 Months ago I purchased a small section for my living room from the Hagerstown MD location After 4 weeks of waiting I was told it was in and ready to be pickedup I drove down to get it only to find out that it was never actually there and was not even on its way The manager at the time did everything in his power to make it right  after another 4weeks he found my couch at another location and had it delivered to my house for free to makeup for it
3 weeks ago I figured why not give American Freight another chance So I went and purchased a BLUE loveseat from the same location I was told to call back in about 2weeks to see if it was ready for pickup I followed up like I was told to and the guy on the phone said my couch was not in yet but should be in another week which I was fine with Then a couple days later the manager calls me asking how I like my new RED loveseat I tell him I havent picked it up and that it was supposed to be a Blue model to which he seemed utterly shocked He told me he would go to the back to check for it because he was sure he had seen it back there  but he took the phone with him and I heard him ask the back room employees Hey I am looking for the Blue Eclipse Loveseat Model  for my customer on the phone and all the employees began laughing
The manager got back on the line with me and told me he would call me back and quickly hung up
Not a great way to end a call  me hearing people laughing at my now second missing couch  and then being hung up on PS Its been almost 2days since then and I still havent gotten a call back to update me
when I needed help to change the book I got nothing 
We had an accident while traveling in New Zealand It was a canoe tip over where we floated down stream for 40 minutes and then when we finally got to the bank the canoe was damaged
This all cost us to recover and repair the canoe and the lose of the five day tour with the canoe
The said I wasnt covered then why have insurance 
Very disappointed
Stephen
They took my money and never sent what I ordered
When I try to call them its just voice mail
My order1222 order1244
Ive checked my card statements
I realized that it has not been refunded yet
This problem still isnt resolved and I have lost my money
One table arrived broken didnt notice until the truck had left One piece did not arrive at all a somewhat expensive piece with little explanation and no indication of when it might arrive
Not a happy camper
All the receptionist were very pleasant and very helpful Brittany  Ari they were very informant and understanding I was very pleased with the mechanic that installed the device He was knowledgable and up to date on how the device worked Everything seemed like it was gonna be ok until I left the garage
The next day day 2 of using the device I blew into the device and tried starting the car it said start your vehicle Turn the key nothing I called customer service number was on hold for almost an hour before someone answered I explained what had happened she said sounds like a technicale problem She transferred me to another person I was on hold for almost another hour I was already Late for work now by this time I had to call out of work loosing over 200 in pay Arri helped me go through all the trouble shooting that we could do Including unhooking the battery for 20 min and doing everything over again She informed me that I will have to have the car towed back to the service center where I got it installed So now I have to loose another day of pay and pay a tow truck driver and after paying for the installation Im almost broke The only thing that would change my opionion of all this is if I was re imburrsed for my loss of pay and tow truck Thanks Intoxalock
I cancelled a booking with another hire company of the verbal Quote given on a Saturday morning When collecting the car on the following Monday morning the price Quote d was not honoured and the GPS was no longer available
Within 500 kilometres the garage we called at advised us that the car was unsafe to drive as the rear brake pads were down to metal on metal The car was also pulling to the left The ticket on the windscreen stated next service due at 65000k and the car was on nearly 67000k when issued to us
We were charged 200 to drop the car off at Sydney even though it was half way back to Brisbane the original office and a previous client had paid the charge the other way
The final straw was derisory apology received from the Melbourne manager
My advice is to think very carefully before using Redspot from Melbourne
The EzCater website is really easy to use Its quick intuitive and the service is great They send you the receipts for easy expensing and their customer service is quick and responsive The issue is that the deliveries are often way before schedule EzCater allows you to choose any time for delivery but often the restaurant only has select pickup times leading to early deliveries The last four times Ive ordered the food has arrived 3045 minutes before schedule was lukewarm by the time it was being consumed
My advice is to set the delivery time for 30 minutes AFTER you need it so itll arrive on time and warm
Should be an easy fix for EzCater if they just notify you beforehand of the delivery time discrepancies
My sprint iPhone 6s is currently unlocked and being used with no problems took about 5 days to unlock I was skeptical at first but Im glad I decided to just give it a try I have a 6s plus that I plan on getting unlocked next
Really bad service
Purchased a new handset from EGlobal Digital Cameras at a great price and it was delivered promptly After six months there was a hardware issue with the phone so I have tried to get it fixed through their RMA process It has been more than six weeks since it was confirmed received by them and they are unable to give me an update as to what is going on In retrospect I should have just paid the extra money and purchased the handset directly Wouldnt buy anything from them again
I use MSE to find the best deal for me taking into account price service and reviews Consequently I end up changing every year The standard tariffs would be 2 to 3 hundred pounds a year more than Im paying Im very cost conscious therefore I will always put price first and look at reviews The suppliers should automatically put youcharge you according to the tariff which is best for you But they dont The Regulator needs to do something about this as collectively the public is paying billions of pounds over the odds British Gas could give an end of year rebate if they could have paid less on a different tariff
It took longer to come than I thought From the ad I thought it was an off brand but it was just a refilled cartrige It was leaking  made my hands all inky  the printer didnt recognize it Its not clear on the website how to get back to them
I have recently purchased an Eames Lounge chair however I am still waiting for it to be delivered
It is quite unclear whether Modecor have the item in stock or not I checked daily their website and it seems that the availability date is constantly changing A day ago this armchair was available and ready to be shipped today it says it will be available from some future date The same confusion subsisted when I paid for my purchase more than 3 weeks ago
I have been scammed a couple of months ago by Wallace Sacks who went bust see also reviews on Trustpilot they were rated 8710 when I paid more than 1000 for a couple of armchairs  they have zero ratings now and is currently under administration due to mainly the lack of stock I just hope Modecor will not become the villain too
Not really happy with the delay in the delivery of my armchair from Modecor The costumer service only told me that theyd deliver last Monday its now Saturday and they still havent replied to may email returning a tracking number let alone delivering my purchase
Very dissatisfied costumer Think twice before buying anything from Modecor Check that they have stock and DO NOT buy anything in advance
I would be happy to add more stars to my review should I receive my chair or be contacted by the costumer service with a plausible explanation for the delay
UPDATE I have got a reply from the company confirming they have no stock and that they expect a delivery in about 3 weeks
I am happy to wait a little more however how much longer
Also they have reported my review to Trustpilot trying to remove it as they say have no reference of my purchase
Ordered filters online and they were suppose to arrive by a certain date I waited a few days to follow up and only then did they send out a label created email and notified me that the filters had shipped Waited another 8 days and no filter Emailed customer service again and they claim my package was lost Seriously I can see the FedEx tracking It never left their warehouse Apparently they created a label to appear to be shipping something but it never shipped Wish I had read other reviews before ordering Waste of my time If my credit card is not credited within 24 hours Ill file a dispute more wasted time
I booked a ticket from Vienna to Mumbai today in Indian Airlines using Travelgenio and the total charge during the checkout was INR 32106 and after the payment was done I get a confirmation saying that I have been charged INR 33991
If you want your tickets to be of 33991 then why wont you just show it that way instead of cheating the customers There is no transparency in the process
Would never recommend anyone to book a flight using Travelgenio
I bought the flowers for my Daughters birthday  once i had placed my order i was told they couldnt be delivered till 4 days after her birthday Then they never turned up till the day after that Ill stick to Interflora in future
Hello Smart Start I concluided my probation time in Octuber 2016 and I was told I will receive a letter about the order to removal my device by mail So Months pass and then I found out that I wlll have to pick up that order in Court So I ending paying Over  46000 Dlls I didnt expect this charge Thanks a lot for your service Bit I honestly wont recommended
very slow on getting the items sent to me
Poor quality color and print And after changing all 4 color cart in my cannon printer everything has a pink tint to it
Beware most hire car  rentals need to charge for damage to make the money I worked for avis
So car was great and airport service fantastic we used the car for about 120km Palma Mallorca to Puerto pollence and back we flew back Sunday morning so we filled up Saturday to get an idea of fuel usage 786 euros Early start Sunday and refuelled 2 miles from airport 6 euros brimmed
My advice take a video of the cars damage i did before and after and kept all fuel receipts So i get home and my initial 95 fuel deposit came back as 86  And another charge 157 for what  No idea car arrived back unmarked The damage form had 2 marks the car had 56 all on video
Surely this is fraud charging for damage twice maybe three times Sent emails nothing So contacting credit card to get a refund
Not trust worthy unless your taking there insurance i guess  1100 deposit refunded so whats the 157 for exactly 
Go elsewhere save yourself the hassle chasing
Posting the before and after video on YouTube as evidence 2moro  enjoy the social media experience
Every month my house mates use pp to pay me there rent and every month I have to chase pp to release the money to me Its a complete joke I utterly hate pp in this area and would massively recommend you never use pp to transfer money
Mr Tyson stated direct pay frm my bank was the cheapest way to go He also stated the money would be withrawn on the 28 of the month I asked if it could bearranged for the first of the month as I only get my retirement on the first of the month He stated that could be arranged He withdrew the money on that day February 23 2017 without my knowledge and contrary to our agreement I am now overdrawn on my bank account I want this money returned too me plus fees incurred This is causing a hardship for me
Sent a return back last tue by dpd still to date no email to say it was returned r recievedwont be ordering again
I sent to your company an email for a reimbursement for more than 10 days now
And still no feedback for your side
Communication really worst one I ever saw
We cant call any customer service
Only call center for booking
Didnt appreciate the fact that we bought and paid for specific seats in specific spot When tickets arrived less than 36 hours of the concert they were NOT the seatssection we had chose and paid for nor were tickets delivered when they were originally posted for delivery
I find that very unsatisfactory will never use Ticket City again We have always used Razorgator and Stub hub for concert and NFL tickets and have never had these issues So much for their guarantee
While the agent worked hard in the end even after I had authorized the payment he said the price went up I had no choice but to pay the added amount because I had already mad other connecting flights Not to be trusted
Never just never buy from this company Absolutely unreliable
I have never received the insurance policy but only the review link

After booking a 5 seater ended up with a fiat 500  much smaller than we booked 
Products did not work as expected
its been a week since i ordered a pair of fans for my mimaki machine order number 100112562 its a quite simple order but to my surprise they didnt had the spare part in stock at the moment even when it showed as available in their website they sent me an email by that time saying that they had only the generic part and even so it took like 2 3 days more to answer i didnt really wanted a generic part not to mention it was cheaper and the difference between the two parts would be available as credit for my next purchase which id probably never make they should have canceled the order from that point whats that slogan for anyway Purchase before 6pm CET well ship your order the same day so yes i made a paypal claim because its been a week and i simply couldnt get the shipment information it was very delayed and i was left without any information about the order status i guess theyre just too lazy at digiprint im definitely not buying from them again word of advice
Lyft always rip you off on the fair and I have found uber to be so much more affordable and more professional drivers Uber drivers also have nicer cars for their basic cars If I was anyone comparing the two please take uber Lyft is not worth it
Your customer service was rude and did not listen to my concerns The supervisor told me that there was no one that I could talk to after him He was the final word He was awful Ive worked in IT as a senior manager for years I know there is always another escalation point
I will probably never buy from Groupon again I have told many of my friends and family of this experience
Why is it hard to talk to a real person from priceline
Collected my car and did the service and returned it to
me
In Christmas time the car did not start for two times so I sought advice from mechanics and they said fuel is not coming to the engine It was sorted by itself after two three days and I was going to talk about it with Servicing Stop as the car was just fully serviced In addition they claim that they provide 12 months guarantees for their services However this is not the main reason of my complaint
The main reason is that in the meantime that the car had fuelling issues I opened the bonnet and I realised that the Top Engine Cover is broken So I tried to contact them several times but they mostly did not answer the phone or someone answered and said the manager is not available and so on So I decided to contact them after Christmas and I did However after numerous communications it seems that they do not accept that they have done it
Firstly they said we will arrange for another collection and will sort this out for youand they booked my car to be serviced again and the engine cover to be replaced in two weeks time They even provided me with a date a time and I stayed at home but no one turned up Then I called them and they said it has been canceled Without informing me
Then they said we will have to speak to the garage that has serviced your car It took another week and I kept contacting them everyday but they did not provided an appropriate answer Finally I could
access to the manager and she tried to resolve the issue Finally she
didnt accept the fuelling problem and did not offer me guarantee service and said fuel filter should not be changed Regarding the engine cover she asked me to get a Quote from Mercedes and I did I sent the Quote to them and finally she said No the garage does not accept that they have done the damage I ALSO TOLD THEM THAT THEY HAVE NOT DONE ANY CHECK ON COLLECTION TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY DAMAGE ON THE CAR ALSO THEY HAVE NOT DONE THIS WHEN THEY RETURNED THE VEHICLE SO THAT THEY CANNOT SAY THIS DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE BY YOURSELF while other companies normally have a checklist and have a look at everything and sign
the checklist by both parties on collection and delivery date But they said we will not compensate and you can ask for other parties to help you in this matter
I even gave them final chance to resolve the issue informally by sending them another email but they said we will not be changing our position
So I ended up with a broken engine cover fueling problem and absolutely annoyed In addition the certificate of service that they have provided is a very dirty and unacceptable paper which has not ticked anything so I am not sure if they have even checked or replaced the air filter oil etc
PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY FOR SERVICING YOUR CAR
YOU WILL PAY TO A COMPANY TO DAMAGE YOUR CAR AND BRING IT BACK FOR YOU
I bought 6 tickets for 230 dls and my boyfriend got the tickets too so I dont want the ones I bought at this site But the problem is that the ticketbis site doesnt give you that option or any number to contact them I dont even know if I have the tickets because I cant download them
I ordered a tablet online Received a receipt but no collection email to follow When I informed the store they were very unhelpful but told me they would look into it and call me back They did not call back I followed up several times but nothing in response Eventually I contacted Management and the issue was resolved however when I went to collect the product the staff had sold my item within 90 minutes of my last conversation They had to track down the product in Irish stores Overall a very frustrating unsatisfactory service I could not recommend DID to anyone
I have made an order transferred money on given account And  nothing No mail Telephone number on the page does not work Is wrong I start to think that I have been cheated
Still after three days my server isnt launching ArmA tried everything and in the best of this story every time that I sends a ticket the supporters replies the same answers

We didnt get the bracket we selected up to 75 TV and the one we got didnt have the correct amount of holesPLUS the part that fixes to your TV was too small for the part that connects to the wall SO it could not even be used as supplied Further to that there is no writing whatsoever on the instructions and very unhelpful pictures about 1000 times more complicated then say and Ikea pieceWe wanted to write to them and complain but they hardly speak English so what would be the point they wont change
Save yourself the hassle and pay the extra for a really good brand we paid over 100 for this POS
The coupon should have been on the site instead I wasted an enormous amount oif time in chat

checked to see what restaurants were still open and delivering to my area I put an order in and after 10 minutes I get a phone call saying they dont deliver to my area i contact Marvinie they sayd i have refund after 3 working days im now at work and i havent more money to buy food
Worst experience ever for booking a flight It was first changed then cancelled then they spent 3 weeks trying to find an alternative
When I called them I received 3 completely contradictory responses as I kept ringing to avoid confusion
Customer service member1 Said I could have a refund for the flight from Manchester to Paris and book alternative means of getting to Paris so that the rest of my flight is intact
Customer service member2 Said my whole booking would have to be cancelled and refunded
Customer service member3 Said I had a time change on one of my flights and needed to say whether I accept it or not
I eventually was offered a full refund to which I replied
Dear Customer Care
I fully accept this refund of 58610 GDP and I can confirm that I will not book with your company again as a result of the poor service and the stress and inconvenience that you have caused I EXPECT THIS REFUND TO HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY unlike the slow service you have provided so far I am utterly disgusted after the disaster with this booking that you have not at the very least offered me a refund that totals the amount of my original payment 603 If not some kind of compensation for your poor service
Your customer service has been poor inaccurate confusing contradictory and has left us worried about a trip that we have spent two years planning working for and looking forward to
The current flight prices for the same trip are an extra 200 above what we originally paid as we originally booked in January to avoid inflated prices
This leaves us in a situation with no flight and way more money to pay
You have spent the last 3 weeks or more very slowly contacting airlines etc in order to rectify this which is too slow for such a huge amount of money and the lack of urgency has left us feeling that your company is entirely unprofessional and you certainly do not care
I plan on sharing this information on as many online platforms as possible in order to let other people know what kind of terrible company you are and how you treat your customers I hope this results in a lack of custom and people will no longer be scammed by your low prices for nonexistent flights
I expect my money to be returned to my account immediately or I will seek further action against your company
Please forward this to your highest management and complaints department
Completely disgusted and disappointed
Greeted after a long trip by a rude grumpy and unprofessional customer service officer is not how one wishes to start holiday We will never book with Redspot again
this is the 3rd time you have messed up my order or having probems with it
1 sent me incomplte item
2sent me wrong item
3missing item in postor a screwed up on your side
The conversion of the currency was not accurate When I placed the order the conversion rate was R1286 to the 
Worst flying experince Ive ever had they did not notify me of flight changecancelation then were unable to help and even gave me bad airline info when I had to deal directly with airlines
Recently purchased an iCloud unlock service from them I waited two days before receiving a mail that they couldnt do it showing some blatant reason which was unacceptable Refund was also not given rather giving a network unlock service free which is irrelevant and not at all useful to me at any time
I was quite happy with the price of the vehicle but some key sales points couldve been certainly used and I believe the vehicle couldve been delivered quicker Not happy regarding the mats situation and wont be coming back for my services
Energia are over charging me I emailed them on Sunday with an explanation They ignored my email
I recently went online and bought two tickets for liverpool v Spurs I never received a confirmation email until next morning but did receive another email ten minutes after completion saying transaction was not complete when I received an email the next morning I was told that someone would contact me to arrange pick up of the ticketsthe game was at 1730 and I had to travel from London to Liverpool I received no call by 1300 so I dropped them another email to say no one had contacted me and I have other options for my day within 12 an hour I got a call to say someone would meet me in the pub before hand I told him it was too late for me to get there and I wanted to cancel the transaction he told me contact ticketbis and apologised it took so long and he understood I emailed ticketbis on 2 more occasions only to get replies from Carlos saying transaction was non refundable I didnt use the tickets and Im sure they sold them on I told them to keep booking fee but as their website says they dont release the money to the seeker until the buyer has received and used the tickets  I told them I want a refund once again I was denied avoid this company at all costs you are taking a major gamble
Says it well doesnt it First key received and second didnt work
Good products and always on time
I think the disrespect to the drivers is too high No one cares to listen the needs and the WHYs from the drivers The real improvements will come from HAPPY DRIVERS and their experience in the field with the customers
I did the research on the company before I purchased the product I was hoping that the product was going to work with my Epson 300  help with the cost of the ink I followed the instruction  printed my sheet  the color was terriblenot even close the right color so I email the company  they responded with instructions which i did twice it still didnt work So i asked to get a refund  was emailed that they would send a free label to send back the product Said it would be there in 25 business day waited pass the the business days after emailing that I never received the label so I sent it back myself with the Post Office I even email that i had it sent back with the instruction I was told to do even sent in back in same package the was sent to me I have had no responses from them yet I guess I just lost  30  on a product I couldnt use Very disappointed  will not recommend them to any of my friends
I ordered a takeaway from via your site on Saturday night 43 It was from Chefs Corner and was one of four restaurants that appeared in my geographical location Not a great selection but it didnt matter so I placed my order I received a call then about 20 minutes later from a guy at Chefs Corner telling me that I live in Glanmire and that they only deliver within 5k of wherever they are based This is all after receiving an email confirmation Which I have and the money deducted from my card
Long story short  He was unable to deliver and asked me to contact Marvinie and they would sort it By this stage it was late and there was no where else to order from The money was refunded on Sunday to be fair Not a great impression to be honest there are a lot of other similar sites which offer a better service
We ordered the same mirror three times in order to get one that was not damaged
And then got a phone call to let us know that the store had three mirrors in stock As we explained to the operator that yes the store had three mirrors  one on the wall all scratched two we returned do to problem with the paint appearing to have been smudged  looked like a thumb print sliding in wet paint
If we can not walk out of the store with the item I doubt we will order anything from RC Willey againJust to much hassle
Perfect
matches my other globe perfectly
Delivered quickly
Packed securely
Thank you
Used this service 3 times twice I paid for express services so items would arrive before a certain date and both times I had to call up to find why the items hadnt been picked up and was told they didnt have time to collect had I have known that wouldnt have used as it stated pick up would be by 5pm
The other occasion went with no problem
Unable to fulfill and deliver the gifts as promised The product is now tiny Ill admit they have not changed the price since I last ordered a cake from this company but the cake is now a third of the size as previous orders I absolutely will NOT recommend this company to anyone
was promised product by a certain date called about it and order wasnt even shipped yet and was told it was going to be expressed shipped and wasnt so they lied and sucked
Order55707636
Placed it and charged and shipped according to tracker on 9th Dec 2016 and yet it still hasnt arrived
Cant email support because order isnt listed by system and therefore cant sent anything by email to them as its required field and they do not show email address as to where to send it directly without using their website
Worse customer support ever and information on how to help yourself with it is nowhere to be found Cant do a return because its over 30 days
My money back or I will sue you NZ Fishpond
I was very disappointed to receive my box of shoes surrounded by some plastic bubbles protection  not even a minimal wrapping no Thank You note or invoice nor any instruction on how to return the item in case it does not fit Not to mention that all the online sites I shop on provide return labels for free Not very professional Pity

The airfare price was acceptable but I was charged and additional 10 for booking fees No way will I use this again
I saw the charge for a question was 2700 when I went online I was charged twice for 1 question I was charged 2700 and then charged 1500 Why
I have another related question and was told I would not be charged again Where do I go to ask this question How can I get more help
We had a huge issue with the company MegaDrive on the airport of Budapest As we booked a Insignia the company gave us a Dacia which is at least 13 of the price We could get the insignia we paid for already for an extra of 21 euro extra per day We didnt do that
When contacted rentalcars about this The feedback we got was that the cars are the same size and have 5 doors airco and a stick When we gave the argument so has a BMW 3 series or 5 it went silence In reviews you can even read that the Dacia is not a secure car and shouldnt be rented at all They also said that Megadrive didnt charge us anything extra That is because we didnt pay the 21 euro
Next point was that we pre paid a full coverage insurance on rentalcars When we told this at MegaDrive she said it was not possible and need to be paid at the counter When I presented the staff that I paid they laugh at me and did swipe my card anyway Also rentalcars doesnt do anything other then pay me the money back for the insurance instead of doing something about the fraudulent staff at MegaDrive
We talked with rentalcars twice on the phone but the mantra back was we are independent and you dont rent a brand but a car which has the same specs like amount of doors airco stick etc  total BS of course
I wouldnt rent here again
I will never use this company again
Where do I begin DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY I am still trying to obtain a refund I am lawfully due after 4 weeks
Firstly they did not explain that I would have to pay customs charges to accept delivery this was 1237 on top of my purchase price Unacceptable
Secondly the item then arrived and it is faulty I purchased a pair of size 10 trainers and the insoles are a size 7 or 8 at the most so cannot be worn the trainers themselves also look nothing like the photograph
After many messages backwards and forwards the company admitted they are the wrong item and offered either 600 to keep I have now paid in total 4000 a replacement or a refund  as long as I return the trainers I expect a full refund but why would I have to incur more expense to return a faulty item
I will be taking this to the financial ombudsman as they are holding me to ransom for a refund I am due
AVOID
Both my wife and I had policies with this company for years but decided to move both policies for a range of reasons Not being able to get somebody on the phone would be a good place to start When you do being sent back to the online system to make changes which the system clearly wasnt capable of was most annoying Most people live busy lives and require quick and reliable service This never happens here  and I have unfortunately too many bad experiences here My wife was getting her car serviced and the garage offered her a loan car for the day Went online to make temp change only to get you fall outside underwriting criteria Sent an iMessage for them to call back when they did they told us to go online to make the change We said we did that already they didnt seem to care Long story short  they refused a temp cover while her car was in the garage I have never had a good experience buyer aware Steer well clear and get to a decent insurance company
I bought FOUR cartridges Three were in a pack which I later realised were not genuine cartridges The other was a genuine Canon colour cartridge The genuine cartridge works beautifully but all the aligning and head cleans in the world cant make the generic Ink Station cartridges work properly in my 2mth old machine I was reasonably happy with price however it was still much more than the cost of my machine But considering I cant use the stock that I purchased it wasnt reasonable at all The packaging was great and speed of delivery was good But PLEASE DO NOT BUY generic cartridges from here I feel like I have wasted 100 because I now have to go buy more cartridges to replace the three new Ink Station ones that dont work Theres a reason they are CHEAP I am appalled at the lack of quality
They missship leave items out and then they dont respond
Its been 6 weeks and I have still not received everything in my order
Every time I request they send the missing items they tell me okay the checks in the mail and then I hear nothing I have done this 5 times to no avail
Plenty of other competition out there Try Udecor or wishihadthat or crownmoldingcom
Architectural depot is the worst
Even 1 star is way too much for Bravofly
I wish I had read the reviews before booking my flight through this company
I booked a return ticket for April 2017 from Denmark to Tehran including a full insurance from Bravofly Two weeks before departure Bravofly informed me that the airline had cancelled the flight I called the Bravofly customer service regarding alternative flight Surprisingly they asked me to directly contact the airline to ask for an alternative flight option And they kept telling me that full refund was entirely upon the airline I had to make phone calls abroad to reach out for the airline central office for a refund as the alternative flight was not even an option neither offered by Bravofly nor the airline
The airline issued refund transaction document which was collected personally by my brother from their central office I forwarded the document to Bravofly customer service But Bravofly keeps telling me that they are still waiting for the airline to initiate the refund and it can take up to number of months to get a refund
I contacted the airline regarding that claim and the airline said that they have balanced the credit for my ticket payment meaning that they have made a transaction to the Bravofly so is apparently Bravofly that has confiscated my money more than 8000 Danish krones
When I complained to Bravofly the ONLY thing that they say and do is to say sorry which doesnt do any good to me as I have lost my money time and holidays Bravofly even charged me 1 DKK per minute for making phone calls to them to get my money back and still havent received after 10 days When I ask about the insurance they ask me to contact the insurance company for getting my money back The funny part is that the customer service of the insurance company is also part of Bravo team AND Bravofly has told me in an email that they will reduce a handling fee of 20 euros from money A handling fee for doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE
SHAME ON YOU BRAVOFLY

We ordered a washing machine water pump The first one arrived damaged We thought it was from shipping The box had a hole and the part was crushed and broken We called the company They refunded us for the pump and we ordered a second one The second one arrived packaged in a flimsy box broken as well I would not order from this company
I ordered a gift for my fathers birthday and they cancelled the order after two days with no reason I emailed them and asked them why and they didnt reply back to me Even though I had the sufficient funds on my bank account and the item I ordered was available but they gave me no reason Thats so disappointed
This site is fraudulent They confirmed payment of an order charged funds then cancelled the ordered for unknown reasons Do NOT ORDER FROM HERE SCAM
Update Please dont listen to anything they said in their bogus reply Your billing and shipping address DOES NOT have to match to use a card How do you think people shop online and send to different addresses everyday on LEGIT sites You make no sense What type of company is this There was no additional verification What authorization code and form You should quality check your system because its terrible You took my money then cancelled the order Nothing in between FRAUDS
And lastly I have NOT received a refund How do you take the money BEFORE your supposed Verification Process Backwards and bogus DO NOT USE THIS SITE
Ive recently sold an item on eBay but the buyer didnt read the descriptions properly and requested a refund through eBay Though the eBay case was closed the buyer raised another dispute on Paypal which withhold the fund in my account without even understood what happened Unbelievable Also they charge unreasonable high rate of commission for the sellers to receive money from the buyer

I dont like that I never received a reminder email that I was within the five days I needed to skip this month in order not to be billed I cant afford to forget or not be reminded about this sort of thing so Im going to end my subscription and the quality of the clothing while decent is not as good as what I could find at GapFit or Athleta so theres no reason why Id pay full nonVIP prices at Fabletics
Exorbitant surcharge at Malaga airport Despite purchasing fully comprehensive insurance online the member of staff on the desk at Malaga airport insisted on charging me 12079 when I arrived to collect the car He stated that if I did not pay the fee I would be required to leave a credit card deposit of 2000Euros as a surety
I was assured the 12079 was a refundable surcharge when returning the car When I returned the car the member of staff mysteriously developed a difficulty communicating in English and rather than miss my flight I left the desk without a refund being actioned on my credit cardsilly mistake
I wouldnt trust these gangsters again Easycar are as bad for recommending these shady gangsters
I ordered my products on March 15th and have not received them yet
I am one of Lufthansas frequent flyers programme premium members yet despite numerous complaints  including to the CEO  nothing has changed but I have received a ton of excuses and explanations On a flight from Malaga to Bucharest via Munich the food served in Business class was a disgrace Three olives and some tired salad leaves half an egg and some pumpkin seeds When I think of the nearly 700 euros that the ticket cost I wonder what kind of service they include to justify such a shameless meal service And yet nobody ever solves this issue which occurs on more and more of their flights It seems like they are making cost saving but on whose expense The tickets keep getting more expensive while the service can now compete neck to neck with low cost airlines which you can fly at a fraction of the cost Its plain simple unless there is no other travel alternative I will stop flying this airline and when I have to fly with them I will make sure I bring food from home with me
They took 3490 from my card when I did not purchase anything for 3490 and did not give me my money back
Absolutely appalling  look nothing at all like they do on the photo  the photos are photo shopped and look nothing like they do on the site  yes the prices are low but the quality is low  I could write so much neagativity about this site as I am disgusted  Ordered for my partner and nothing what I wanted  Trust me avoid  Shop at interflora where you get more than what you pay for  And also all the flowers on show on the site are fake
I received a Quote to sell this book multiple times and I sent the book in good faith everytime The book was in new condition every time I later get an email saying that I have sold them this same book before and they will send the book back to me at 399 at my cost Meanwhile they are still offerring Quote s on bookscouter to this day for this exact book It is very bad business not to honor your Quote s If you want a better experience I would suggest Powellstextbookscomcash4books or chegg They are much more professional
I receive emails without the option to unsubscribe something i consider KEY for a good service
It was bad experience with keep calling and now i am leaving your application service due to bad serviceThe main reason is that when i do call to India network gone offline and call rejected
During a complete and expensive rebuild of my transmission they failed
to repair the existing leaks in the lines from the transmission cooler I took
my truck to my mechanic for service and he was surprised to see the leaks because this was the reason they sent me to Cottman in the first place
One of the worst sites on the internet
I have left some reviews and they have been taken down for words that I see appear all over their site on other companies
Our company has had genuine reviews removed and yet they have allowed fake a defamatory reviews to remain is this the kind of company you want to deal with Should Trustpilot be allowed to engage in ruining businesses effecting jobs No
I have requested for their complaints procedure and CEO details all of which have been ignored
However if you pay Trustpilot they will make sure your company stays at the top of the list dont pay them and they treat you like trash
I think its about time someone investigated them its also funny how they report their own reviews and can be in control of their own website when they are the ones who set their own guidelines This site should be called donottrustpilot
I Purchased sanitary ware and tiles for a cloakroom refit November 2015 The tap sold to me for low pressure turned out to be not fit for purpose After ordering from the showroom I was told everything is dealt with by customer service
In April 2016 after numerous communications to customer services I finally received a letter from the customer service office manager agreeing the taps sold to me would not work under low pressure We have acknowledged this mistake and have agreed to the return of the tap and issue a full refund and as a gesture of goodwill we will refund the 75 refit charge
I sent my letter accepting this refund by return in 2016 and have emailed copies to the office administrator when requested since
I have been calling customer services endlessly since November 2015 when I raised the problem and from April 2016 for instructions for return and refund of c200
I have only ever been able to speak to an administrator and leave messages for the office manager who wrote the letter Since April 2016 the officer manager and her boss have always been out or in meetings I have also been copied into emails from the administrator to the office manager asking her to call me
Neither the office manager or her manager whose email was passed to me by the administrator after a year have ever come back to me
I have been advised Porcelanosa are in fact in breach of contract but still no resolve The showroom a separate arm of the company and who can not help in this matter have though tried to contact the office manager on my behalf as a measure of goodwill copying me in Still no joy even when other company staff ask
Reading other review sites I am sadly one of many customers receiving such dreadful customer service and being left out of pocket by this company and this office manager who is actually named in other reviews This is certainly not the customer experience I expected from Porcelanosa or would want other people to experience
My next step is to explore legal action I feel though as the sum for Porcelanosa is minuscule they bank on customers not pursuing such claims In contrast my bathroom refit was carried out by a local company who have been brilliant even going the extra mile with a brand supplier to exchange a part that failed just out of warranty
Please before deciding to entrust your hard earned money to Porcelanosa explore all the review sites out there they feature on I can now only wish I had
I booked the tickets through this fraud portal after making the payment I got to know that baggage is not included in this flight

No mention that there is a charge for picking a seat
You will not get better out in the market
Turned the car in early but was unable to receive a credit Best to deal directly with rental agency The money saved is not worth dealing with an unresponsiveuncooperative 3rd party
I will post the same on all my social media sites
As a print vendor that was with ASF for two years I can say it was a waste of time and money The company did not deliver what they promised and there was zero communication to their customers when they had concerns about their investment After I ended my membership they even went as far as to remove all traces of content I contributed to their forum over that time How low can a company go Join Art Storefronts and find out
I wrote to one lady to make a booking only to have another lady contact me back offering accommodation I thought this was the lady I contacted and made the booking only to realise later that it was for a completely different host The accommodation looks nothing like the one I thought it was For this reason  ie I didnt know that my details would be forwarded to someone else I have give only 2 stars This was not made clear to me and I hadnt wanted anyone else to contact me  I had avoided the tick box to allow this service or so I thought Sorry to ramble on 
I have been on program for 2 months and have not lost any weight I want to stop my program now

I received a set of damaged bags and have been trying to resolve the issue but no one will help me I was conversing with someone via email but they have stopped responding and everytime I call customer service they say its been handled by a manager so they cant help me When I ask to speak with someone else Im told they are the only person working right now I am beyond frustrated and regret ever dealing with this company At this point Im scared to mail back the damaged product in fear I wont get my money back
Car unroadworthy would never use again and they didnt seem to care
Didnt return my call unacceptable
facebook offering a further discount didnt accept my Quote  convenient way of NOT giving the discount very poor
I would not have to call you if you just played fair with what you are offering online get your act together in that way
Besides that I find you guys quite good overall
Delivery windows kept changing Finely showing up  1130 pm

After one hour on the phone trying to get my money you have complianced me to death
Everytime I ring to find out if my employer has sent my pay I was put through the ringer Even when I asked you to review my history there was always more question I just wanted my pay
The last conversation with Joshua Hughes of the London office on the 22nd February was a 1 hour nightmare He asked me where I was working I stated that I am in Algeria he put me on hold for 15 minutes then came back and said there is a problem with people sending money from Nigeria Wrong country mate Algeria Then he put me on hold for another 15 minute Very stressful
I have done hundreds of transaction thru OFX and this compliance is ridiculous
I can not handle the stress of trying to do business thru OFX
I ordered 2 replacement game cases and 2 games from their online store They sent 1 empty case worth 99p in a tiny cardboard envelope via courier and then tried to state all items had been delivered Con artists It was impossible for more than 1 item to fit in the envelope and now they are blaming courier Joke Out of pocket and having to fight via paypal which I doubt will be any use as they want evidence and they provided tracking for the 1 item and claim all were in same parcel Avoid at all costs I used them in past and seemed fine Never again They have lost my custom forever
I couldnt even get my check cashed because it was so faded so you all got a free book out of me Thanks for that
I have paypal account for ten years and they now asked me about new ID verification for security reasons I send them all required documents but my account is still locked Support absolutely dont reply my emails So I am very angry and think that all my paypal money is lost

My name is Deborah Rawlinson I applied for a loan from them online on Tuesday I received what u called preapproval I was assured or certainly led to believe I would be receiving the loan of 5000 Waited all day today Thursday  much running around and hassle to provide them with the details yesterday I was led to believe I would be officially approved today I was called by whothe girl working on my application twice the first time I was told they only needed one more bit of info and the lender would happily grant the loan I had already provided that info the day before so it was a little annoying Then they told me I was only approved for 2000 my old vans worth more than that Im devastated after all the stress and will make sure I warn everyone else online about NATLOANS
No valeu a pena

I booked 8 days car hire in Munich through Holiday Autos which turned out to be using Flizzr I gave an estimated collection and drop off time My drop off time was 12 and we dropped back at 1300 I had paid for 8 days and the times have always been a guide however we have been charged a late drop off fee We are disgusted and Holiday Autos have not been helpful at all We are now receiving letters to say the number plate has been damaged even though there were no incidents at all when we used the car all we did was drive to the hotel and back I realise now why they told us not to have the car inspected at the drop off so they can rip people off and suggest damage when there wasnt any Never use this company we feel like we have been scammed
The actual size of the fridge we ordered was different than the cut sheet by 14 which makes a big difference when you are trying to fit it exact under a counter It also took longer than 6 weeks to get our order

Sparefoot made reservations they said with Storage America in Providence RI When I arrived at the facility there were no reservations made I was then bounced around to two difference facilities trying to find space to move my furniture into storage The truck Sparefoot reserved for me broke down The entire day was a disaster
When I called Sparefoot to assist me with the problems I had the supervisor Kate from the Phillapeans told me there was nothing Sparefoot could or would do I asked to speak to her supervisor and she told me her supervisor was Chuck Gordon the CEO Really Well when I asked her to transfer me to him she said that all she could do was give me the generic email for customer service
So Sparefoot took their money and ran They dont care at all about how the experience turns out for the customer I will NEVER use Sparefoot again because they simply do not care about resolving problemsonly about making reservations so that they get paid Very poor customer serivce
Love the lights Did notice that within my last order 1 of the light bars didnt work Please make sure that they are working The issue light didnt work but also would not allow any of the light in that chain work
I paid 2500 for laser eye surgery in April 2014 The main reason I opted to use Optical Express despite them being more expensive than other companies was because lifetime aftercare was included in the price I paid for laser eye surgery
I had a free aftercare appointment in September 2016 where they told me I needed corrective surgery as my eyesight is poor I require glasses or contact lenses to be able to have 2020 vision I did not expect this a mere 2 years after surgery however as they were prepared to fix things and to fulfill their promise of 2020 vision I was happy for them to correct my vision I decided to wait till 2017 so I could arrange the time off work to have the surgery
In February 2017 I tried to arrange an appointment to begin the process of the corrective surgery however I am now being told it will cost 5000 to just book an appointment Of course I asked why as I was promised free lifetime aftercare After all I paid for my eyesight to be corrected and their surgery failed But their reply is that aftercare is only for 12 months and if I require corrective surgery ie to get the eyesight I was promised I would have to pay for this again
Optical Express deny that I was ever offered lifetime care Despite already allowing me free appointments after 12 months and despite thousands of others having the same promises made to them They even explained how costeffective the surgery was as I was told I wouldnt have to pay for an eyesight test again
They say it was just 12 months aftercare in my terms and conditions I was given no copy of these term and conditions The only document I signed was to do with potential adverse side effects Which by the way the first time I read these was minutes before my surgery 4 weeks after I had already paid the 2500 for the surgery
A medical procedure should never have a time frame for aftercare  especially when you paid for the surgery on the basis that you would be looked after for life Disgusting company
Tried searching street name but just keeps telling me to select a street name

What can I say I ordered a bouquet of flowers for next day delivery and the recipient never received it They just ruined my day and my confidence in buying flowers online Prestige Flowers blames the courier and me the courier is blaming the company for giving an incomplete address and the customer me still waiting for a refund mediated by PayPal The customer service is there just to copypaste random lines from TC not to help in any way Their greed is shameless really
I bought product after a very persuasive and high pressure sale I am being told they are doing a special promotion and will use staff The salesman was the manager of the shop in london near bond station I noticed that he asked me from where I am from once I mentioned I was not from here so not local he became extremely persistant and persuasive I feel they are targeting tourist I finally bought product for 400 Then 5 minutes after I left the store realized that it was a mistake I do not know those product looked at the internet and realized that it is definitely not worth the money I felt been manipulated and trapped I went back to the store for a refund I have been told yes it is possible you have to contact the email on the receipt I asked how will I take back the products then he said you will come back in store with a number code for refund I have witness of this I sent an email and am being told that they are not doing refund only exchange I am extremely frustrated but this situation I want to escalate this and will do the necessary step If someone has the contact information of the CEO mr Deville seems to have been in touch with him or any phone number please can you kindly share Most importantly I would recommend to everyone to avoid this untrustworthy company Their selling techniques are very aggressives and the customer service dishonest If you have any advice please let me know Julie
I did not receieve my lenses after 20 days of placing the order and been charged for it so I called them and they told me my specific lens had been discontinued However I never received any notification of this until I contacted them which I consider unacceptable
I also kept asking them what other options they had available so I could let my doctor know as he is from outside the US and they did not help me at all Very bad experience with this company
do not deliver then when you query them and try to claim back via paypal they tell you to close paypal claim or they wont send order
Then they dont send it out
After buying an item I noticed that item is useless without another item that I need to buy There was no mention of this another item on the item I have purchased webpage Couldnt go anywhere with customer support for a resolution to this problem
THESE PEOPLE WILL TRY TO HARD SELL YOU EXTRA INSURANCE CHARGE FUEL IN ADVANCE AT HUGELY INFLATED RATES AND DEMAND A 1200 DEPOSIT AT THE OFFICE BEFORE YOU DRIVE AWAY EVEN IF YOUVE PAID FOR HIRE INC INSURANCE ONLINE IN ADVANCE AVOID THESE CRIMINALS We booked online through Rentalcarscom  arrived Bcn airport they have no cars at the airport collection of cars involves a long convoluted walk outside and around various car parking areas in the heat to eventually find the Goldcar bus which drives you miles away from the airport to their secure compound in an industrial estate
After a long time waiting watching other customers stressed crying being berated by staff we were warned by other customers not to buy the extra insurance
Finally got served by a very rude woman Despite having paid for insurance online she claimed that it was invalid as it wasnt their insurance Tried hard to get me to buy their insurance 200 for 2 weeks cover If not we had to pay a 1200 deposit or we couldnt have a car The day was getting on and we just wanted to get out of this stressful office with other holidaymakers upset angry being forced to pay for extras we were miles from anywhere managed to negotiate the price of extra insurance down to 100 and agreed to pay despite buying insurance online I thought Id just try for a refund on that postholiday we just wanted to get going Turns out they want another 90 for fuel in advance Does this little hatchback even take that much fuel No way Managed to negotiate the price down a bit this is starting to get expensive but weve already paid for the hire online we dont want to go through the rigmarole of cancelling going back to Barcelona airport empty handed to then have to go through the whole car hire process from scratch they exploit this scenario at their secure compound some people just pay up the extras so they can get on and not lose a day of their holidays others leave upset out of pocket EVERYONE is stressed out truly horrible experience

I checked the advertised price then completed the booking When I confirmed my purchase the price increased almost 20
Ive stuck with Fabletics because I dont know how to cancel beyond calling and waiting on the phone I mean because of this I have purchased some things but thats usually because I forget to skip a month and get a credit Not really how you want to create a clientele though Wouldnt suggest other people come to Fabletics except that you have talls in some stuff You do usually sell out of that though so I usually have to get leftovers for length which makes me feel as if Im bargain bin shopping when Im hoping to get something high quality So again not a good experience and not one that I would tell people about
Very hard to get in touch with a representative
Not everyone has a good Internet connection Questions not able to be answered
No answers of emails the chat only promises to get an answer nothing happens
My husband and I went in to buy a couch set and found one rather quickly I ask the woman that greeted us if they had two of a certain couch She left to check Another employee came up to us and asked rather snooty if we were greeted when we came in We replied yes Again with a lot of attitude she asks By who I really was appalled by her attitude and walked away and let my husband deal with her Well the lady helping us comes back and confirms they have the couches We go to purchase them and I am all but ready to pay She asks me if I know how much the couch was I tell her the price and she walks away She goes over and speaks with my husband saying that someone must have switched the tag and couldnt honor the price that was listed on the couches We just walked out the store Ill try not to shop thereoverall bad experience
There is no record of my order with the electric company Plus your chat stopped working when I was chatting with an agent Horrible service

Bought a pair of clearance ski boots They said ships in 35 days A week goes by and I dont hear anything or get any communication I reach out to customer service and after another 48hours I finally get a response saying boots are not available They billed my credit card as soon as the order was placed yet took over a week to say they cant fill the order Terrible online experience compared to other online merchants They then offered a substitute which wasnt as good of a boot or deal I said yes anyway immediately as my options were limited as inventory was more picked over The next email from them was another apology saying the substitute they promised is no longer available Now their offer was an even inferior boot to their substitute and was going to cost me 25 more  than the original pair I ordered Terrible experience
Called for flowers for a friend who just had a baby All was well on the phone call Was Quote d 58 I wanted it delivered that day since she would probably be gone from the hospital by the next day Which they agreed to do after he had checked with delivery man and florist 7 hours later I look at my email to see a charge of 67 for 3 roses and a tiny bear Thats insane  Also almost 10 more than what I was told would be charged to my card I also look to see that none of my information is correct other than my first name email and phone number My address was shown as Arizona when I live in WA and last name wasnt even close  I also tried to track my flowers to see if they even were delivered and there was no confirmation and the deliver date said the next day What A HUGE MISTAKE AND WASTE OF MONEY  Calling company tomorrow to see if they will at least compensate me for the original Quote 
Update The flowers were never deliver  I had contacted my friend and asked how she liked the flowers and bear to get a very dumbfounded what flowers and bear Then After calling and being on hold and arguing with the lady on the phone for about 20 minutes that I did not want her to deliver my already over charged pathetic 80 flowers to someone who was not in the hospital anymore I was put on hold for another 10 minutes and luckily was finally refunded my money after about 3 days Dont do it  Read the reviews Look at all the deleted reviews  Not a good company
Horrible service

Made a reservation through Opodo 2 months ago They recently emailed us telling one of our flights got cancelled Thats it They didnt suggest any solutions They just gave me a number that doesnt exist anymore
Now Ive been trying to contact them for 3 days writing on their email calling them 0044 800 368 3866 music is playing nobodys picking up the phone
So what am I supposed to do with my flight Are you going to change my flight now or get me a new one Are you going to solve this problem
Everytime i order everything goes well except for the last time i had a really bad experience with Ssense that made me stop ordering from them
In february I hired a car from this Company The car was not given regular service before delivery som I had to fill engine oil This was not a problem but I informed the Company about it when I delivered the car back The car was delivered back with a full fuel tank and no damages
Returning to Norway I soon found out that Goldcar have drawn 550 euros from my Mastercard  With no reason given at all I have contacted them for an explaination and they have confirmed receiving my mail But they still not given any explaination and they have not payed my money back
I have informed them that I consider this a simple theft and that legal action will be taken

My experience with Reid cycles
2 weeks and I still havent received the bike I ordered sent the wrong model the first time received a week and a half ago mistakes happen I understand but I rang to tell them that they had sent the wrong item no apology or anything seemed to be a chore to organise someone to pick it up
Wouldnt send the correct item until the other one was picked up in an afternoon when I was going to be at work so had to wait from the Wednesday till the Monday to be home for the courier  complained in an email that it wasnt fair to not send it until incorrect item picked up
Last Friday morning was sent an email saying that correct item would be dispatched next delivery its the following Friday and still nothing
No connote to track it to try and be home for the courier
Email yesterday morning asking if its been sent and where it was no reply
Absolutely disgusted at the service Ive received and will not be doing business with REID cycles ever again was a birthday present from my partner which was last Sunday and didnt get to enjoy it
Definitely will be shopping local from now on
I started selling things on Ebay and the only choice is PAYPAL  so I had no choice The fees are VERY VERY HIGH and then the service you receive is PATHETIC 
I sold some gift cards and the transaction was fine it was sent recorded delivery and everything was fine
Then I go to try and sell some more unwanted gift cards and PAYPAL put the payment on HOLD   not release for 21 DAYS  
I am sorry but that is not acceptable
I called them and they were NO HELP AT ALL The call quality was terrible   I could hardly hear the customer service agent   It was like talking to a robot 
My problem wasnt resolved and the money was still on hold for 21 DAYS   so I reported it to the buyer and canceled and refunded the sale
I WILL NOT PUT UP WITH THIS KIND OF SERVICE
 remember the longer PAYPAL has your money the more INTEREST THEY MAKE
It has completely put me off selling with Ebay and I am shutting down my PAYPAL ACCOUNT 
Think its rubbish how companys like aerial force can take down and report all bad reviews whats point as they seem to beat system
Now I am really annoyed see my original message and your reply
Your tickets say ticket also includes a transit pass any Belgium station Leiden is in the Netherlands Nowhere do your tickets confirm validity in the Netherlands The words Any Dutch Station is nowhere on the tickets
Your tickets are not confusing they are simply wrong
Can you tell me if the tickets are valid in Leiden

I booked Leiden  London The email included tickets only for the Eurostar I sent an email querying the other tickets and got no reply I tried telephoning but the number was constantly engaged I had to buy new tickets Leiden to Brussels The SNCB service is really disappointing and worrying  we are both almost 80 years old and can do without such hassle

Many thanks for sharing your feedback James
We are sorry to read that you have been encountering difficulties to call our Contact Center
We also regret that it was not clear to you that your Eurostar tickets include the Any Dutch Station supplement as shown by the any Dutch station mention appearing on your ticket and in your fare conditions Your Eurostar tickets are valid all the way indeed from Leiden to London via Brussels
Your connection from Leiden to Brussels is not specifically mentioned on your ticket as this kind of ticket allows you to take any train at any time except Thalys from any station in the Netherlands to BrusselsMidi
We admit that this may seem confusing by its simplicity On the other hand this kind of ticket is not only more flexibel as it allows you to depart from anywhere in the Netherlands but also much cheaper than a separate ticket from Leiden to Brussels
Feel free to check if you can still get a refund even partially for the additional ticket you purchased  which turns out to be superfluous
We nevertheless wish you a smooth and pleasant journey
Ordered a pcb pump driver for a Mira advance shower I was installing parts were missing out of the box and no instructions 
When we went to collect the car at the airport we were informed we had to pay 19day extra more than the cost of the car hire for an additional driver even though we did not need the extra driver It was just a case that the person who booked it was not the driver when booking they do not give you the option to state otherwise Annoying as this was we were willing to paay the fee then to be told the car was a peguot 208 when we had book a 4by4 The woman at the desk insisted it was a big car even when confronted with pictures of a 208 absolutely ridiculous We were then told we could not take the car without the premium insurance which was 50day which was completely too much at which point we just gave up and requested a refund which they obviously did not agree to as they are the absolute worst company I have ever encountered This also seems to be a theme with them so unless you want to get completely ripped off when collecting your car avoid this company at all costs
Let me start off by saying I NEVER write reviews but this one I have to write
I purchased a vehicle 2010 Buick Enclave from the Marlow Heights Md location in October of 2016 The day I drove the car off the lot there were issues with the vehicle I had to bring the vehicle back to have some work done to the drive axle November comes and goes payments made on time everybody happy December comes and goes payments made on time everybody happy
January comes in with a bang Im driving down Interstate 95 in Woodbridge VA when all the warning lights starts coming on and the engine dies I called the warranty company Aaverix they told me to have the vehicle towed to Pep Boys I did Pep Boys said hey we cant fix this There is engine problems air bag problems and motor problems So Aaverix approved to have the vehicle worked on by the Buick dealership The dealership said the engine had to be replaced with a long laundry list of other items to get the vehicle back to safe operation again
The dealership contact Aaverix Aaverix said we will only pay for the engine and thats all I called Drive Time and they told me they would cover the cost of the rest of the repairs or I can get another vehicle I said ok Great I went to the dealership to try to find a vehicle that was similar to mine There were none I couldnt go to a smaller vehicle it just would not meet my needs So i agreed to keep the vehicle if they repair So during this time I had to rent a SUV to keep my life going which Aaverix was not reimbursing me for which came to almost 200 a week So the engine was ordered and it was put in but when the dealer put it in there were other issues with the motor that was preventing it from running correctly I called Drive Time customer relations and spoke with another lady and she said they would not be covering the cost that they would only cover 70 and I would be responsible for the rest HERE WE GO AGAIN Of course this made me furious I went on and on about how they just told me 2 weeks ago they would cover everything She eventually put me on hold and came back and said yes Im sorry we will cover the cost and we will wave this current payment Ok Great she said but since the engine is in the car can you have it towed back to Pep Boys because they can do the work cheaper I said fine
Now we are on week 4 of not having my vehicle Everyday the collections dept calls me looking for a payment I tell them they need to call Customer Relations and I havent driven the vehicle in over a month So now Pep Boys have the vehicle again They get the car running and only fix the items related to the engine and nothing else They tell me to come pick up the vehicle I get there and the ABS light is still on Service Stabilitrak Service TPMS Service AirbagService All Wheel Drive So at this point Im furious as to why they call me and the car is not fixed They advised me Averix said to only fix the engine and thats it So at this point I call my attorney and give him the details He advise me to call back to try and get it fixed if they decline then we could look at court So Pep Boys call Aaverix and they said they will cover the axle if I pay another deductible Umm HELL NO If you told me to come get the car and you knew it was still messed up I will not pay another one So today I called back Customer Relations and they said they would wave the deductible Which let me know that DriveTime Aaverix and Bridgecrest is the same damn company When I mentioned about the 1 payment they would wave she told me no that was not in the notes Im fed up I dont have the energy to fight with the LIARS ANYMORE I WILL JUST COUGH IT UP AND I HAVE LEARNED MY LESSON If you are looking for a vehicle Please Please Please take my advice Go elsewhere It is not worth the headache and worry of these LIARS Im in the process of trying to trade this car and go with another company SAVE YOURSELF THE HEADACHE AND STRESS
Update 31717
DETAILS AS PER MY LAST REVIEW NO CONTACT FROM 5PM YESTERDAY THEN ANOTHER AUTO MATED EMAIL AT 0755NOW 1330 ON SECOND DAY AND STILL NO DELIVERY IF YOUR ORDER IS FOR A SPEIAL PERSON IN YOUR GO ELSEWHERE
I boughta couple of things for 70 euros When I received the items they charged me 30 euros additionally
If I had my time back I never would have switched Company doesnt inspire confidence or trust
the files are not organized
Dont trust them when they tell you on down payment Quote over the phone After you get to the dealership they want you to put down 14 cost of the vehicle Terrible way to conduct business
Fel bukett blev leverad
They tell you one thing and do the opposite 
Didnt deliver on time no explanation no reason for delay will never use them again
Ive tried about 4 HelloFresh boxes and like the idea of it While its convenient and prevents food waste its a bit pricey and the meals can be hit or miss The pictures of the meals look great online but the taste of the meals arent consistent Also if you want to canceldeactivate your plan make sure you do so 5 days in advance prior to your delivery and track your orders if you pauseunpause your subscriptions Otherwise you might end up with and pay for a HelloFresh box that you do not wantneed Please note that HelloFresh will NOT send you a tracking email notifying you that your shipment was sent Overall I was disappointed with the customer service and my experience with HelloFresh I tried calling and emailing them and never received a response so I had to call again for clarification This may be great for some people but is not for everyone
Sometimes it takes more than a month to get my orderI have liked everything I have received but you sure have a long wait Example I order from Amazon all the time and always get it in 34 days Go figure I am disabled so their are a lot of things in easy comforts I can use I guess its worth the wait
I am honestly livid at what has happened today on this service Online it looks like an amazing deal but dont be fooled
I got the full service for 139 which I thought was a great deal and then I asked for spark plugs extra which was ridiculous as most services do them as standard anyway I was told they were 43 inclusive of fitting and VAT I get a call to tell me my car was ready and the bill was 235 BUT no engine coolant or brake fluid had been topped up because they needed replacing wrong I paid to have them all replaced 8 months ago so I know you were just trying to get extra money out of me The privilege of this was 125 plus vat
When I questioned why the bill was 235 when it should have been 182 as that was what I was Quote d he said the spark plugs were 7999 plus vat Spark plugs have never been 80 I told him I was told last week they were 41 and he said that prices change daily and I had to book them in advance which I did last week He agreed to honour last weeks price how nice but I had to pay vat on it Online your price of 43 inclusive of Vat
So basically I have just paid you 18950 oh yeah you have to pay 1 for the privilege of using your own debit card for some checks 4 new spark plugs and some new oil No other fluid in my car has been touched
absolutely will not be using this service again its ridiculous
Oh and we collect and deliver your car for free  yeah and spank half of my petrol in the process and bring my car back stinking of cigars Terrible
Tried updating my shipping and billing address several times site did not save information and my package is being returned to sender Contacted Opticontactscom twice via email before they responded They can resend order with an additional fee once package has been received but fee was not specified in the email Unhappy with customer service at this point
Wouldnt let me use my free shipping code process became frustrating

42 for a cake that I could have bought at the supermarket Such was its quality Dry not much flavor and with frosting only on the top and not much of it What about the sides bruh Plus 19 for shipping First and last time I order from this horrid place
This company should not be in business for one more second It sucks and will definitely ruin the reputation of any business who chooses Purolator as their courier service
The driver doesnt want to deliver the package actually He just want to dump the package at your front door and gets his job done if you even call it a job When it comes to apartment building and you need him to knock the door and leave the package at the front desk believe me he wont even bother to enter the lobby And the customer service specialist in Purolator probably dont care either All your explanation and complaints wont matter Nobody in Purolator cares
Order arrived damaged Will be returning and asking for a refund
Hello
I am trying to find a number to call you at

I booked a return flight through Lastminutecom with Turkish airlines LondonYaounde The airline cancelled my return flight Lastminute informed me by email and told me I could book another return flight on a different day or get a refund
I requested a refund Quote over one month ago and am supposed to hear back from Lastminute within seven days I have not received it over one month later I have called Lastminute maybe 15 times Every time I am told I will get an update and callback within 7 days or 24 hours or that evening or within 3 hours No one ever gets back to me
All I hear are apparently sincere constant apologies and claims that my query is being escalated and reescalated and that the problem lies with the airline as they are not responding to your requests for a refund Quote  I find this extremely hard to believe I have called the airline many times and am told every time that according to their terms and conditions it is the booking agent Lastminute thats responsible for calculating and issuing a refund I can get through to them on the phone in less than 3 minutes They are extremely helpful and efficient so I dont understand why its taking ONE MONTH for Lastminute to get in touch with them I can only conclude you havent tried to get in touch with them and are simply stalling in order to keep my money
I am in Cameroon and supposed to fly home in a little over a month I desperately need to resolve this situation get the refund that is owed to me in order to get home
This is clearly your business model There are hundreds of postsstories like mine on the internet
When are You going to sort this out
1 They do not take P O Boxes which is frustrating because they get dropped off at the local PO I dont get packages delivered to my home if it goes to the local post office They get sent back What a go around 2tried to change my delivery the first time around and once order is placed this is not an option very irritating After placing a second order 3I was able to track this and inconveniently had to drive to the local post office to get my package  which is out of my way 4 Upon opening my packages I discovered I received four different kinds of curtains total of eight with a width of 36 Four thick glossy foam backed curtains and four microfiber without the foam backing I originally ordered only 4 panels that were suppose to be foam backed 5The four panels I ordered were suppose to be 80 length Wow I order a lot online and WILL NOT be ordering from groupon again
cheap nasty and overpriced when seen up close 
If you are fine with Avis sending whatever is available from the florist that makes up the delivery and not anything that resembles the arrangement you wanted then this is a great place to order from I wanted to get a tulip only arrangement that was featured on the Avis website Their website even said if I ordered in the next 43 minutes they would waive the delivery charge I got all the way to the point of paying what I thought was the 6499 tulip arrangement and although they waived the delivery fee they added a 1348 Service fee I called Avis and complained so they waived the Service Fee I bought the arrangement in good faith that it would be similar to what I saw online I was wrong The friend I sent it to said it was full of greenery spring flowers and 3 flower buds that had not opened She didnt know it they were daffodils or tulips I called Avis and they said it is in their policy that it can be a Designer arrangement instead of what you thought you saw online I didnt read the fine print so I lose but so do they because I wont buy from them again
I purchased 2 Wearsafe devices for my college age daughters Unfortunately  they simply did not work out They controllers are very sensitive Even after trying to correct the setting they continued to go off if bumped or tapped The result left me getting numerous alert messages for no reason In addition they are poorly constructed and fell apart numerous times resulting in us pushing them back together I sent them back and asked for the account to be cancelled after 2 months On a good note they where responsive to giving me instructions as how to return the items and cancel the monthly service fee

What kind of a service would you call this It does not even deserve a star
But to write this review I had to give it a 1 star
I will never insure with this company again

The cabin itself is beautiful On the other hand there was a huge problem with the water It was very cloudy and very smelly I guess of sulfur The faucets would spray out in a sputtering motion and the pressure was off We let it run for Almost 30 minutes on 2 separate occasions one before the plumber came and once after and after it ran you could see the dirt in the color of the water light brown and by the dirt visible in the sinktub The bathroom water barely got warm So showeringbathing was annoying The shower with the jacuzzi tub would spray out so bad when the jets were on that it soaked the whole bathroom Then the button got stuck to where it kept spraying and we had to use a knife to pry it back out to shut off the jets The shower upstairs either sprayed in a sputter motion or barley let any water out The kitchen sink was a toss up Sometimes it worked and sometimes it sprayed and sputtered out You could smell the rotten egg smell anytime the water was on We had to buy drinking water They were doing work on the cabin next to us And in the kitchen there were exposed wires in an unfinished outlet But other than that it was very pretty Our family enjoyed the beauty of it And the beds were soft But the water was a huge issue so it gets 2 stars And one lamp upstairs was missing a light bulb It was beautiful but needs work
Ate too many steps to return merchandise Im very disappoint
The food was okay mostly like the convenience of having almost everything in one box for each meal but their website is awful and you cant select the same meal twice so if they have two options you dont like you have to skip Also their skip feature doesnt always work
I placed my order online It took almost a week for the order to ship I still have one item on back order that was supposed be shipped on February 12th and have not received it yet
Hi
back few months ago you Guys didnt sent my correct order I had some boots missing on my orderIve tryed to in contact with you And also left you msgsbut No one Answer me or called back at all
Nearly impossible to make direct contact with insurer once you have taken out the policy
Worst level of service that I have received from any previous insurer
Renewal Quote was extremely high and double what I received from my current provider
No restroom in the facility
I got the program of favorites because it was all I could afford The food was mostly bars Bars for breakfast bars for lunch bars for snacks I quickly became tired of this food Not only that I signed up for this program because I received an email offering a discount of 20000 When I checked out however the 22400 has escalated to 27600 When I contacted customer service I was told someone would get back to me No one did

Today I was trying to connect my HP laptop to my HP printer It kept telling me that I was not the admin on my laptop So I called customer support for some help After waiting over an hour to talk to someone the man told me that the warranty was expired on both of my products so he could only help me if I bought extra warranty All I wanted was for him to tell me how I can make myself an admin on my own computer No other company has ever made me pay extra money when I had a question about my product This is absolutely ridiculous and I am completely appalled by the service that HP gives to their customers I can guarantee that these are the last HP products that I will ever buy I will be now buying from companies that are willing to answer a very simple question
I made an order on 11012017 and received the items on 17022017
WHAT A SERVICE
there wasnt any excuse just emails that my order will be delayed
it was delivered by probably the cheapest DHL delivery as it took 5 days to arrive

overall  if you want cheaper gear this is ther place
but if you want a modern day delivery time choose a different site
4 packages ordered over a period of 4 months 4 time I was at home all day 4 times I got a text message  your package could not be delivered since no one was home
Maybe actually trying to deliver it would help and ringing a door bell as well complete untrustworthy service
Poor product Unresponsiveness from groupon
Rentalcarscom forwards you to Budget rent a car or other companies When you get to Budget as happened to me and as they admitted verbally happens not only to me they dont find the voucher or they have some miscommunication with Rentalcarscom The result is that you get double charge from both companies  You pay twice When trying to resolve it each company forwards you to the other  Rentalcarscom are not even in the US They forward you to call the UK 
Be aware of this Scam  My issue was not resolved I actually been charged twice 
Ordered 2 jogging pants Received 1  but tracking showed 2 delivered Called customer service Was confirmed only 1 shipping but they would not reorder Was told Id be reimbursed to my card in 10 business days That is yet to be seen and Im not holding my breath Will not order again from thisCostumer care and satisfaction is clearly not on the priority list and they deceived by leading to believe that they shipped the full order until I called them on it Very bad experience
I think its poor that sterling does not get a fair euro exchange I bought a 20 Euro gift voucher for my nephew but was charged 20 sterling which I think is unacceptable so will not be buying vouchers online again

Turns out I was speaking with someone from another state who had told me the facility was near me but it turned out it was 15 miles away 24 admin fee where everywhere else is half that and 1999 for a lock and everywhere else is 10 or less also had reserved an 8x8 online but after speaking to them none were available Chose a far better facility near to home
They charge booking fees which I could deal withbutthe 24 hour change  cancellation policy they do not honor They wanted full price of ticket that includes 3 flights they would not change one leg of the flight per my request without charging me the entire ticket price 943 plus an additional 7500 I was within the 24 hour policyBUTthey have a policy that it has to been within the same calendar day I called the airlines that the flights are booked withBUTdont bother because FLIGHTHUB is in charge of making the decisionyesdecisionit is well within their rules to have made the change without charging me full price DO NOT BOOK THROUGH THIS COMPANY
I decided to give Servicing stop a go yesterday and WOW how silly was i
They collected the car and took it to a local garage and unfortunatly the car failed the MOT on three points The cost of repair through servicing stop was 480 plus VAT without the 3rd job been mentioned Ive since spoke to a local garage who can do the work for 100
signal is quite unstable
We purchased our new car on the Wednesday and on the Thursday our bank had tried numerous times to contact the sales person and the car yard to no avail so they finally got through on the Friday We felt you made the sale that was it and we waited 5 days to get our car because our sales person was off work
My package was lost or stolen and it took over 5 weeks for ssense to issue a refund to my bank I was very disappointed with the experience

Sure low rates are great for passengers but not for the drivers Lyft has the ability to increase rates to make the service a service not a giveaway Ive heard too many stories of drivers being deactivated simply based off of a passengers feedback never asking the driver their side of the story Ive also heard stories of drivers not being completely covered in certain situations specifically when a passenger is involved The city of Seattle requires Lyft to provide uninsured motorist insurance for the driver but the terms of the insurance not clearly state the coverage only applies IF the driver is in driver mode Sorry drivers no uninsured motorist coverage unless the driver has it on their personal insurance
LyftLine a joke travel 15 minutes to pick up someone to take home under 3 Again great for passenger horrible for the drivers Outside of The City of Seattle
PrimeTime you could get a request from a PrimeTime area that was 150 You take the ride with no knowledge if the ride is PrimeTime or not At end of ride 0 extra The competition tells you up front of ride has an increase attached to it
Customer Service Slow is the nicest way to put it I often take to twitter to get a faster response to incidents Incidents are supposed to be resolved in 24 hours I had one take over 48 When you do get a response They are frequently copy and pasted responses in which the agent doesnt take the time to change the name in the email to yours Makes you feel the Lyft Love
Local Office Excellent service little parking Youd think that for a company that relies on drivers and their personal cars parking would be available or even reimbursed
rating based on failed unlock experience 1 month ago i contacted them before making the payment they advised me to try and find my lost credentials and in case i fail i can always use their unlock service this was their last human response after that nothing just auto response saying my legit phone reported as stolen and therefore cannot be unlocked and instead they giving me some voucher to other services that i have no interest in  so my money taken and no unlock  no response so far still not giving up

I made reservations and when I landed and went to get my rental car they said they couldnt give me car because I only had a visa debit card This is the card I reserved it with so I was at the airport and had no car it was awful Thank goodness I found another place to get a car but I had to pay double because there were barely any cars left only trucks
The insurance value is decent at a cheap cost however the monitoring system in the car is poorly defined and will not take into account your correction on the road for other users for example you may be judged incorrectly for breaking and turning and the system cannot take into account whether youve been cut off or if you have to move around a parked car at specific corners Also there is no benefit to having a high score where other companies will provide you with money back for good driving
The current customer service system is just terrible and its designed for them to contact you at their convienence without any warning at all I was owed a refund and they insisted that I contact them when I didnt they sent me a cheque out for the refund I fail to see why they couldnt do this in the first place instead of insisting I contact them
I never got an email confirmation even after I requested it
I bought a full price dress for my daughter The day it arrived she tried it on and it was too big I called Peaches Boutique to see what I needed to do to exchange it for a smaller size The first person I spoke with told me the dress was not available in the smaller size She advised me to have the dress altered I looked on the website and saw the smaller size dress was available to order I called Peaches back and was told once again that the dress was not available I said that I was able to add the dress to my cart and the website stated that the dress WAS available and ready to ship in 4 days The operator told me that they did not have the dress So now instead of an easy exchange I have to spend even more money having the dress altered

Do not come to fredericksburg location theyre very rude and the guy who helped my friend was cursing when speaking to him and complaining the whole time Was not aware you had to make an appointment and taking it out on him that other people were late to their appointments and saying he will not serve him again knowing he had court before showing up Disappointed and will be speaking to manager
They delivered something I didnt order were unable to stop the order and shipped it to me anyway I then had to spend 75 of the purchase price to send it back Im now out 45 and still dont have what I ordered
bookingcom just dont care  they never investigated this fake hotel and their malign practices they offered us compensation of 20 but never replied to our genuine concerned  I have stopped booking with them  hopefully their monopoly would end soon

unacceptable they charges me ticket protection plan without me knowing it ill be posting this to my facebook you guys are scammer
The only thing this company has going for it is that chat supper the fact the people on the other end of it are clueless is no help
They have overcharged me when I cancelled my account at least three times they didnt even contact me to tell me Straight to debt collectors
They deactivated my website losing my money due to a malicious plugin
Stay well clear
once again I place an order an important order for a Z6200 PSU without it the printer is dead
still awaiting delivery so decided to check my account digiprint only to find order still processing so I still have a dead printer no delivery and waited a life time on so called live chat
Yet again it appears to be an order where the item is out of stock yet they failed to notify me at any time of this instead making me have to contact them to find out
VERY POOR Time to find a new supplier I think
Delivery NOT on time  10 days delay 
Only HALF of products delivered
NO timely answer to multiple emails
I will not place order again
Hi

I have sent number of emails to customer services but didnt received a reply Attempted to call but all lines are always busy
I am being charged interest daily on the outstanding balance
Never ever again I would like to complaint to their regulator if I knew who to complaint to
Shame on you Dickmanns
6 months ago viagogo took 213 out of my account for 2 tickets they failed to deliver customer service is rubbish they tell you your guaranteed to get your tickets its a load of lies 3 days before concert I contacted them after receiving a message to say theyll be delivered shortly i then had to chase them up and had email back to say they havent any tickets 6 months ive been waiting for these theyve left a little girl extremely upset and me minus 213 stay clear of this company
Your bank account gets charged when trying to pay by credit card or if you successfully change to your credit card by reading all the small print they will charge you using their extortionate forecast fees without even giving you the option to pay in the original currency during checkout You need to read tons of small print to be able to use the service without getting ripped off
I chose Servicing Stop based on their website a they imply they are backed by the dragon Deborah Meaden b they use OEM parts and so your warranty should not be invalidated HOWEVER I later found out that Deborah pulled her investment in 2010 let you figure out your own reasons why and because Servicing Stop work as brokers for local garages therefore it is an absolute lottery what you get Servicing Stop have no power if youre not happy with your service For example I did not get my service book stamped nor did I receive any detailed breakdown of parts used  Both are needed to validate my warranty but apparently Servicing Stop will ONLY request from garage if the customer requests at time of booking  I was never given this option and in the 30 years I have serviced cars I have ALWAYS received a breakdown of what theyve done and what a garage has used Needless to say I am now stuffed with my warranty and will never use Servicing Stop again
 UPDATE 
Total lack of customer service Despite leaving my phone number and emailing at least 10 times to date 3 weeks later all I have received is their automated  copy and paste response of we are sorry to hear about your experience please get in touch with us blah blah
I had just walked out of the plane and realized I had left two iPads in the back of the seat in front of me I asked to go back and retrieve them and they would not let me First they told me they would be retrieved and left in the lost and found within 3 hours Then they said they would email me within 3 to 5 business days letting me know if they had them They ended up turning in the one iPad but not the other which doesnt make sense since they were together When I tried to locate the lost and found Lufthansa employees were extremely rude and they didnt seem to know the process of getting my items from lost and found or exactly where lost and found was If its possible use a different airline
I order a pair of shoes and where very happy to receive them just a couple of days later Unfortunately they where too big and I returned them in accordance with cancellation terms The refund came shortly after but refund of shipping costs where excluded despite the fact that the terms for cancellation on the home page states that these costs are also refunded Despite request on both email and through PayPal I have not been able to get a refund of these costs A shame as everything else worked fine
Your website forfeited 16 credits from my account
Your customer services reply was There is oneyear expiry date for the credits
Fine You have lost me as a customer in future since there are many stock photo websites out there
I had a very bad experience with Travelginio When I bought the tickets from Argentina to Peru when I was typing the name it was no enough space to put the complete name so I call Travelginio the lady that answered the phone told me dont worry buy the tickets then call us again and we will fix the name I trusted what she said I bought the ticket then I call back and another lady said no problem I can fix it you just have to paid 15000 dollars more because I need to do another reservation At the end after many minutes arguing she said I give you 2 options or pay the difference or I cancel the ticket so I decided to cancel the ticket She refused to give me a confirmation of the cancelation and let me talk with the manager Even though the ticket was canceled immediately they charge me for the ticket Then my nightmare started I called many times to the numbers in New York but nobody did nothing until I contacted the main office in Spain I need to say the Customer service in Spain was very helpful but it took 3 months to have my money back meanwhile I was paying interest for the money in my credit card
I really think that Travelginio needs to fix their web page that is no right not to be able to write your name they cant limit the space because there are some names very long and when you travel your name needs to be spell exactly that appear in the passport and the other thing is that the personal that is in customer service needs to be well trained and not lie to the customer But I am great full that Travelginio gave me my money back Thanks Customer service from Spain
Item dispatched on Monday 13th Feb Still have not received it by Friday 17th Feb Poor service
Its been over 2 weeks and I still havent received my order I live in a metropolitan area Blainville Qc Canada not in the middle of nowhere This shouldnt take so long to receive

THE WORST FIN SERVICE EVER THERE WEBSITE IS BAD THEY DECIDE IF THEY LIKE A CUSTOMER AND CANCEL THE TRANSACTION
DONT BE FOOLED BY A BETTER RATE RATE DOES NOT MATTER WHEN YOU WANT TO TRANSFER FAST THIS IS NOT THE FIN WEBSITE TO USE ZOOM IS THOUSAND TIMES BETTER
SENDING CANADA SHOULD BE EASY AFTER CREATING A TRANSACTION THE MONEY WAS DEDUCTED FROM MY ACCOUNT NEXT DAY WITHIN 24 HOURS
THEN I RECEIVED A SECURITY CALL TO VERIFY AND THE PURPOSE IN 5 MINS I WAS TOLD WE HAVE CLEARED THIS TRANSACTION
THEN FOR 4 DAYS THE MONEY WAS WITH THEM AND NOTHING WAS HAPPENING SO I ARGUED AND COMPLAINED A LOT AS TO WHAT IS HOLDING THIS TRANSFER WHEN EVERYTHING GOT CLEARED 4 DAYS AGO
SUDDENLY THEY CHANGED THE STATUS TO WITH PARTNER
AFTER 48 HOURS IT WAS STILL WITH PARTNER THEN I CHATTED AND YELLED AT THEM WHY IS IT WITH PARTNER FOR 2 DAYS
THEN 2 DAYS AGO THEY CANCELLED
THIS COMPANY IS EVERYTHING BUT FAST PLEASE USE ANY OTHER COMPANY
I waited 10 days for an order and it never came When I called they said they got my address wrong so they reshipped it The reshipment never came Now its been 25 weeks since my original order This is ridiculous
Ive tried to unlock my iphone 4s on doctorsim and it said the bill is only 999 Waited for 7 days and said that it may take more days to unlock it Waited again and said they cant do it regular price It has to be 100 Note Its an iphone 4s That is more than the cost of the phone right now
The worst part is when you asked for refund They put it as a credit So you have to use their service again to get your refund I dont recommend this to anybody
I chose this company to send a sympathy gift to a family during their time together for their mothers funeral BECAUSE THE PROMISED DELIVERY DATE WAS EXACTLY WHEN the family would be all together However it was delivered 4 5 days late when everyone had already left for home In fact even the host family had left for
the weekend and found it when they returned on Sunday so noone was home so not sure whether it was delivered Saturday or Sunday
The postage cost was almost 50 of the cost of the product and it is unacceptable that the gift did not arrive as promised
I went 10 books and they sent back 5 and didnt give me my check for the other 5 they kept Wont be going to then snymire
Good service  But part didnt fit Put in my hover serial number said the part would fit my hover but it didnt
Disappointed
after 3 years of being a good customer without claims  they have raised my insurance twice no thank you
Very disappointed with the bacon Very fatty out of a 1lb package 12 of the pound was FAT Would never purchase this again
Staff are good value Should have told me about petrol and where to find cheap price
I requested unlock for my brand new 7 from EE and they priced me 3299 for the service After about 1 hour I received reply from them saying they can do that after 6 months of my contract or I need to pay another 80 I requested 24 hours refund as stated but havent heard from them since I paid 33 for an information I already knew Dont spend my money in the stupid things
Stay away from this thieves
The delivery guys was wonderful but the merchandise had blue ink on it and the manager still wanted them to put it instead of taking it back

This is my first experience with my new Energia account I found that the website is extremely slow to the point where no information shows once you click a tab until at least 3 minutes have passed This has nothing to do with my web connection as I have no problem with any other site Also an email letting me know that my bill was ready was never sent
As this is my first time dealing with this energy provider it has not been satisfactory I even found that the replies from custom service were also very slow at coming back to me compared to other energy companies that I have dealt with in the past
In short purchased table and piece was missing and they sent a team out to my home twice without the piece that was missing I was told that I would get the replacement part at the end of January 2016 but in actuallity it was delivered and installed the last week of February 2017
The flowers I ordered and the flowers I received were not the same Because my grieving grandmother didnt send me a photo of them within 48 hours they refused a refund At first they only offered a 15 STORE CREDIT AS IF I WOULD RETURN then after a heated discussion they gave me a 10 percent discount on an 80 purchase AFTER I emailed them 3 times before they replied Completely dissatisfied with the entire experience
Rental carscom was a great service However I booked fox rental and they werent very friendly The car I was given was not clean and the back side door was not closing properly I asked for different car because children were sitting next to Ithe unclosed door They were short and said it would take 30 minutes Werent customer service minded
They sent me a link to track my purchase A link to a courier company that was not delivering my purchase When I contacted Hitchweb They told me that they did not know that the courier was not delivering my purchase Then they give me a link to the courier that is supposed to be delivering my purchase The link has a message saying that my address is a bad address Cannot be located After going back and forth with Hitchweb about the Bad address they tell me that they gave my phone number to the courier company and I will have to deal with them direct because it was time for them to leave the office I will never deal with Hitchweb ever again
Ive had a decent experience with the products Ive purchased but a TERRIBLE experience with the consultant Not only was the no refund policy not communicated at all to us during the party and even during the order process but I was misled in being told it would take 34 days to receive my backordered product I feel like I was being duped by the consultant in order for her to make a sale and when I tried to cancel the order after not receiving it in the anticipated timeframe shes ignored me I gave her adequate time to cancel my order and will be disputing the charge with my credit card company BE AWARE of the return policy before you purchase anything you are unsure of this has been an unnecessary headache
It costs me a lot of money to buy it online and the massage ball looked weird I think the pressure of the ball was empty and very time I roll my back on it slide off i recommend people not to buy it is a robbery for your money
DO NOT ORDER FROM CHICAGO AIRBRUSH SUPPLY
OK with that out of the way I ordered a really expensive brush and compressor combo They pretty quickly emailed me back to say the brush was out of stock Irritating because they could have just updated their website to reflect that status but they let me order anyway I responded to their email and asked them to please cancel the order as I needed the items quickly and I would be able to get them elsewhere No response to my email
The following day I called their customer service number I talked to someone who was rude hardly listened to me and then without any info aside from my order number told me I would get a refund in a couple of days That was 12 days ago
They no longer respond to emails and no one answers their phone I left voicemail and attempted to use their web based chat too Nothing
Super super high outrageous fees per each ticket purchased If you press complete my order You will be charged a ton of extra money So please review order before you hit complete my purchase And make a decision You will be SCREWED Too much 
More than the actual ticket price SMDH
I have ordered with you before and the cartridges were fine But these one have caused our printer to crash It doesnt like them are wont print So Im not happy about that
AUTO PRICE UPDATING CAUSED ME TO HAVE TO REDO my personal info on the order 3 TIMES and the fear of having to do it a fourth time caused me anxiety and to hurry up possibly causing a mistake in my order since I could not take the extra time to recheck it
Purchase an order verify completed but the order is cancelled with no reason
Redspot is so smart to take the security bond deposit yet so slow on getting the bond back I strongly suggest that cash should be acceptable for security deposit as well Other than that the service is great
We booked a flight for my daughter and grand daughter from Calgary to St Louis return The flight to St Louis went normal but on the return flight Delta flight information suggested both passengers where 3 yrs old and could not fly without an accompanying adult My daughter is 25
Delta indicated that FlightHub was the one to enter the information in Deltas system Either way both passengers had to be rebooked as new passengers in Deltas system and almost missed their return flight to Calgary
Most likely will not use FlightHub ever again
I was charged a 27 fee for switching electric companies which I was never warned about nor had I ever been charged for switching in the past What a complete waste of time AND money Very upset And NOT FAIR
I cant say enough about my disappointment with Hobbylincs customer service The fact that I had to contact the manufacturer to verify that indeed there is no supply issue speaks volumes

The car was fine however every aspect got overshadowed by the rudness of the personal of goldcar
very horrible customer serviceNobody ever answered my calls have been calling them from last 3 days but the freaking claim manager named Lewis would not answer my call or email the entire process of claim is just frustrating and agonizing
I really trusted this company to deliver my sisters 40th birthday flowers I am embarrassed to see the photos she took to show me the flowers she received I ordered a large extra 10 Rose  Lilly Hand Tied bouquet of flowers created by Melanie I would have liked to attach photos to show people what she received It was poorly constructed bouquet I thought it will look at good as the photo however it was far from it
She did not receive a large bouquet but a small to medium size one she further told me she saw that some of the roses have begun wilting already I am astonished with the high reviews of this company When they delivered such poor service I have contacted them three times regarding this order I emailed twice to customer advisor Darren Hurst to discuss what she received I still have not receive a reply regarding this order I put two enquires through on to their site and still no response
I would have liked to speak to them before posting this review however there has not been a response and left me no choice Please avoid
Booked a car with these chancers Paid 45 for 4 days which was extremely cheap however the insurance they tried to force me to take out was 96 euro and then there was a 26 euro charge for refuelling the car which is a bit of a joke Apparently there was an option on the website to return the car full with no charge I didnt see this and when I said Id return it full I was told it didnt matter as id be charged the 26 euro anyway No cancellation was allowed so I decided to cut my losses at 40 quid and take a car out with autoriesen who were very helpful and much cheaper All in all Id avoid these gangsters if possible
I bought a ticket for my son on Ticketmaster Resale for a perth wildcats final He turned up at the venue to be advised that only Ticketek could sell tickets The ticket I bought was worthless I contacted Ticketmaster the next day and have had no response or refund Disgraceful
First their live chat is deceased you can never get a live person to ask questions second they are quick to take your money but never send what you paid for and third its a fly by night rip off company and the attorney general needs to investigate this companyJESSEE JAMES used a gun to rob with DRESSLILY uses the internet to fleece its customers
I recently purchased a Groupon for two weeks of boxes for 60I am moving in two weeks so this was a perfect for me not to have extra food in the house Unfortunately I was having trouble applying the Groupon code online therefore had to call in to customer service The first representative I spoke to said they applied the code for me and I should go online and schedule deliveryselect my menu I was able to log on to the website but I could not select my menu options I called back and spoke to a second representativethis time i was told they reapplied the Groupon code reactivated my account and I should not be able to go online and select my menu It worked and I thought everything was fine Then I get an email this weekend that says my delivery was unable to be processed I called this morning and Im being told that I can not use the Groupon since I had purchased back in October 2014 and my order has been cancelled for tomorrows delivery WHY WOULD NO ONE TELL ME THIS WHEN I CALLED IN TWICE BEFORE Now Im out 60 and i will never recommend HelloFresh to anyone the supervisor I spoke to was not even apologetic for the lack of customer service on her reps for failing to disclose this information prior Im going back to Blue Apron after this should have stuck with them in the first place
I accidentally booked the wrong dates for my hotel on the day I was booking it I called Agoda and they called the hotel Usually I would have to pay the first nights fee due to the cancellation policy however Agoda readily agreed to pay that fee for me I was really impressed with their efficiency and grateful for their service
BUT I received no emails as such they cannot prove that the customer service lady told me I would get a refund Now I still do not have a refund for this
I am so mad at the aroma globe product It is so NOT what was described Not only is it not an oil diffuser I cant even open it to add water to use as an humidifier I had good experiences with groupon during Christmas but the one thing I buy for myself just might be a deal breaker for me
Did not mention my product would cost 20 more due to USA rate
I miss my flight because of the storm then i did pay it two times its never happen with me
odered over 3 weeks ago received nothing When i contacted them and asked them for a tracking reference number they immediately refunded me with no explanation When i emailed them stating that was shocking service and to go all this time without posting or contacting me is not acceptable They told me item was returned becaue i provided a bad address  The addrress on the invoice is most definitely mine  theyre just liars So they take ur money after theyve scammed u on additonal tax they then dont bother sending item then theyll convince u its ur fault u provided wrong address Urgh scummy little company that i would advise all to avoid
After a month waiting I inquired about the order 1702170926710794that I had not received They said it might be delayed as much as a week A week later still no package I wrote again and this time the customer service reply was that the order was lost in shipment I replied that if they could expedite a reorder I would do so If not please refund my now 5 week old payment The very next day I received another customer service note this time stating that the order was delayed At this point I do not know what to believe but certainly am not inclined to ever do business with them again
I placed an online order for 2 items I was contacted immediately and told only 1 item was in stock but that they would send it immediately and send the second item on when available The first item arrived the next day which was greatly appreciated
However 5 weeks later there is still no sign of the second item and no response to my queries
My son is in the military and he bought my ticket His orders necessitated a change They wanted to charge me 275 plus another 1600 even though the air fare diffierence was 100  I realize the change was going to cost more but what a rip off
Prestige Flowers customer service is one of the worst Ive EVER come across online How can they claim to be No1 Online Florist when Prestige Flowers have FAILED to deliver my order they FAILED to answer my emails youve FAILED to reply to my Live Chat enquiry which by the way is NOT a Live Chat Feature and they FAILED to offer me any kind of compensation
I ordered this bunch of flowers to be delivered on February 8th paid for Next Day Delivery BEFORE 9pm on the 7th I received an email confirming the delivery date  but they have NOT arrived Ive confirmed with the reception at the delivery address that NOTHING has been delivered but yet the Customer Service representative claimed that the courier says theyve been delivered How is this possible Why are they using such unreliable couriers Why arent my flowers delivered on time as both the website and the email I received claimed they would be
I was on hold for 15 minutes TWICE before my call to Prestige Flowers was answered and I found Customer Services thoughtless and so without empathy that it drove me to frustration  she didnt sound like she cared and was merely repeating the a scripted apology Claiming it is a busy time and orders may not arrive is NOT an excuse If Prestige Flowers cant deliver the product because they are unable to handle a certain amount of orders they shouldnt accept more orders and Prestige Flowers certainly shouldnt take the not insignificant sum of money from customers if they know they cant fulfil orders either
Its not my fault or interest that your courier has failed you  but that is not my problembut Prestige Flowers have effectively taken money for something you cant deliverliterally
Prestige Flowers claim that you are going to start an investigation  I fail to see how that is going to help me when the delivery date has passed and they have FAILED to deliver the promised delivery So I have effectively paid for something that Ive not received so I require a refund ASAP
Prestige Flowers Service and Customer Service is a joke two emails broken Live Chat 2x 30 minute phone call with NO adequate responseyouve failed the most basic task that a florist should do Offering me a measly refund of 480 on a bunch of flowers that cost me nearly 50 is frankly insulting in the extreme Raising an investigation is of absolutely zero use to me when the promised flowers have NOT been delivered to my fianc on the day required
I have a 36 waist I ordered Large 3638 and they are to small Now I find I cant return and am out 3600 Never again

Paid to unlock my Samsung Galaxy S6 UnlockRiver provided the unlock thru the MetroPCS unlock app Problem is that my S6 was sold BEFORE MetroPCS added the remote unlock code to their phones So I require a numeric code just like the S5 line I contacted UnlockRivers support people and got the lessthanhelpful runaround This used to be a good company to do business with and I unlocked several phones with their help previously I wont be using them again Bad business attitude and poorly trained employees

Item was delivered to wrong address PartsGeek has not sent me another item even though it was not my fault PartsGeek chose the shipping company I have paid for the item with shipping cost included Good customer service would have sent me another item as ordered and then figured out what happened
I received my frames in less than a week and were even nicer than they looked great so I placed orders for 2 more pairs I spent a small fortune on the glasses because I had such an amazing experience the first time I received 6 emails asking to verify the small amount charged to my card for security purposes then my order would be released I complied each and every time the repeated phone calls at my work were answered with the same request for the same amount I gave the amount expecting my order I still have not gotten my glasses I have a reprimand at work for the repeated phone calls and as I was writing this review I received yet another e mail asking for me to verify the stinking  233 charge Im starting to think I am being scammed Please just send me my orders already it has been 2 weeks 
A crappy CalDav solution to integrate mail and agenda into outlook results in jamming my outlook over and over again
This besides the fact that the CalDav plugin has to be updated more than 1times a week Its really a horrible customer experience
When asked to a planning they say they dont know when and if they will succeed in integrating with EAS syncing Outlook
Goof luck with that 
I bought a bed set for 3700 The showroom showed that there are 8 supports on the bed and we only received 3 I weigh close to 400 pounds and do not feel comfortable sleeping on the bed knowing that it might break at any time
From time of order to delivery was just over one and a half hours Not good when you have guests around Probably wont use this service again

Has an unusual mantra of the customer is always wrong They have a faulty website Which drops out and there customer service line is commonly on the fritz I know its not just me as others start hitting up the online question box in droves This company i assume works as a third party In revenue raising at the exspense of fools Who have booked a service through them There advertised price is not the price U are going to pay well more Hopefully not to much with your sanity
I am not happy at all with this company My contacts were not in stock and had to be ordered from mfg It could take 710 days to ship to me When I checked the status after 2 weeks I was told the order had shipped from mfg but had not arrived at warehouse yet I asked for expedited shipping and was told they couldnt do that I needed to understand that any company would have this type of delay when getting high power contacts from the manufacturer After waiting 20 days for my contacts to ship I ordered from another source and received my order in 2 daysI cancelled my order from OptiContacts and will not use them again
On Monday the 6th of februari I ordered flowers with the promess that it should deliverd on that day

Signed up with Groupon to take advantage of a very good deal from Windjammer Cruises in the Caribbean Confirmed availability with Windjammer before purchasing the Groupon then purchased only to find out I havent actually bought anything until Groupon finishes processing and sends me an email After waiting a while for the email called customer support to find out the credit card may have denied the transaction despite no indication as such on the Groupon site Yet another call to the credit card company BofA revealed no denial just an authorization of zero dollars Finally another call to Groupon revealed because I am a new customer I have to wait an extra 48 hours for them to process Fortunately Windjammer another much easier call went beyond the call of duty and is holding a cabin until the Groupon processing is done
Always changing the prices i selected a flight and literally after entering my details and booking it had gone up 15 even though i selected this trip That should not change oh and they also said it was in CAD then there was a note saying its in USD AFTER booking WTFFF This company is a SCAM and a JOKE  Will NEVER book again Lesson LEARNED

Order shipped for free but freight company charged freight on top of import tax the latter tax is fair Wiggle disinterested in the costs their chosen freight provider arbitrarily apply Its policy not a consumer sympathetic or service oriented response
It taste like old coffee wish I could return it
Ordered a beauty trolley which arrived nice and quick Fairly easy instructions to put the trolley together but the trolley came with brown marks that I cannot get off Really annoying as this is suppose to be brand newunused It is a white trolley so the marks can easily be seen It also had a weird condensationliquid in the packaged box Would not purchase from here again as it is very disappointing
Needed help finding out about a charge by PayPal on my charge card With each message I sent they would reply with no help just tell me to report the problem They take you round and round in circles till you just give up Never want anything to do with them again

Was looking for a larger storage unit at the Public Storage I currently have an account at Sales associate would not get up from the desk and seemed to be uninterested in keeping my business Only said that he had nothing that he could rent to me So I went to another Public Storage who was very helpful in obtaining my business Since this was in another town and was a new account under my spouse we did the internet special 1st month 50 off We were then told that we did not qualify since my spouse had an account at another facility that I was the emergency contact on Feel that I was taken advantage of because it was a different store and the internet pricing was not honored
Ordered 3 ink cartridges Upon opening one the ink started spilling out from cartridge onto my office carpet I immediately threw all 3 out
I called and told them what happened They said I would be credited for amount and to write an email stating what happened and ask for damageincident report Sent email and have never heard back from them
The interesting thing is that the last time I bought ink from inkfarm was about 10 years ago and the cartridges ruined my printer I figured after ten years the product would be improved so I took a chance and ordered this time NEVER AGAIN
Had another framed arrived damaged with a nice chuck out of it due to improper packing Otherwise service has always been good
Possibly the WORST experience EVER Less than 12hrs after paying a day early might I add the cruise is reduced by 250 per room Worst communication efforts from the agent Wished i had booked DIRECT
Waited 3 hours to collect a prebooked car not cleaned  dent on everypanel  stunk of freshly smoked cannabis  must have been staff  Complained at hire desk rudely given the option of waiting another 3 hours or taking it  Rang DoYouSpain no help manager out of office will ring back  never did 
Most annoying when I got home gave clear polite customer feedback  DoYouSpain not interested  no customer service  not bothered about such poor product delivery 
Watch out rip off fueling charge too that you are not aware of at the time of booking  ended up being the same cost to hire as the big companies  but with 3rd world service
A company that does not care about its customers  DO NOT USE

Booked a flight on Friday for 1202 dollars to uk  was sent a confirmation saying the flight was confirmed My friend got an email requesting copy of passport and credit cards He responded a day later and was charged 1395 dollars for the same flight that we had had confirmed for 1202 I was so annoyed and asked them to cancel it as I can book it cheaper on another site The reason I booked with them was price and now I am being robbed of 200 dollars more for the same flight Totally insane If this is good service then I dont know what bad service is I shall never book from this site again And would not recommend it to anyone who is booking internationally
Due to my job I have to spend around 20000 a month online I have been using Ebates and befrugal and recently Swagbucks and they are 99 of the time accurate I tried topcashback twice First time on American Express gift cards and second time for a flight ticket and they denied to give me my cashback Had to file a claim with BBB to receive both of my checks HORRIBLE experience
I changed the flight timing so amended the booking details changed the pickupdropoff times n flight details it has been 3 days since I amended the booking but the status is still pending confirmation N there is nobody to write to or chat with to solve my booking status
The dresses are horrible I ordered a dress and when it came it wasnt the right color The jewels look so fake like something a kid will wear for halloween Then the size range dont match I got my dress and half of my body couldnt fit into the dress Never coming on this site again And will never recommend it to anybody
Reps lack empathy I didnt feel that they really wanted to help me I understand there are rules they cant change however the reps presented those policies in a hostile manner which made me felt that they care less of how customers would feel Im sending my review for improvement in the way reps represent remitly and is NOT to cause harm to anyone

Thanks to Euroflorist my order was delivered 2 days late on Feb 16 and I didnt receive any reply to my email until Feb 22 regarding the status of my order
Thanks for ruining my valentines day
Ive used taxi box a few times and its always worked ok Then we had to move a box interstate and we were told we could have it delivered to the Byron Bay Area We paid for the redelivery to Brisbane and were told they couldnt deliver our box to Byron because it was outside of there redelivery radius So we had to pay more cash for someone to bring us the contents If we had known we would have had a removal company do the move for us at a much lower cost so it wasnt cost effective in the end Kind of annoying Taxibox should not give out information and then not be able to follow through or atleast train there staff properly to how exactly they operate Probably wont use them again
I ordered a set of baking tools which contained 46 tools They only SENT ME 3 TOOLS The service guy asked if I would like a reshipment or refund and I answered I would prefer a reshipment because I really wanted the tools If that was not possible I obviously would like a refund Then the service guy said I had to send back the 3 tools unused and in the original package and so on to get a refund and also marked my service ticket as solved I really dont have the time and energy to send back 3 small items which will cost me more then the refund Ill get This is really bad service and I feel scammed
First time I bought something from this site and definitely also the last time
I ordered one Carhartt jacket and I received another Carhartt jacket Then I inmediately contacted to Fc Moto and reported the error pics included I was waiting their answer for 23 days and they didnt tell anything I contacted with them once more and Fc Moto told me I must return the wrong item and I did it After one week I asked them and they said that didnt received the jacketThey should choose a faster return because its a serious mistake to send a different item One month later I still am without jacket and money They offer a veryvery bad service
Ladies and Gentlemen
I am really disappointed about the supply of service  The flowers were delivered in the middle of the night means between midnight an 200 on the 1203 and not as agreed months order on the 1103 It was the 50 th birthday of my girlfriend and the message card has also not been delivered I think I paid over 1000 KR for a miserable service 
So my prom is March 11 I was very excited for my first prom because Im a junior but anyways I found this beautiful dress on here and I just fell in love with it So I ordered it like January 14 with the custom measurements and it said the set date to get here was like February 26 which I was fine with Well it is now March 6 and my dress is no where to be found so if I want to go to prom I have to go out and buy another dress when i only have 4 days I recommend that if you order on here order like 5 months in advance because you wont get your dress on the set date I will never use this website again Worst website out there
I booked some flights and car rental through Bravofly and received an email saying that the booking was awaiting confirmation I was suspicious of the car rental price as it seemed too low and I contacted them the next day to query it
I was told there had been an error and that the car rental price was incorrect and utterly excessive I asked whether I could cancel the car rental and continue with the flights and was told that was not possible I requested that the booking be cancelled and told that my money would be refunded
I set out to purchase new tickets Foolish me
I have now had two phone calls from people telling me the flights have been confirmed and subsequently I have emails telling me I will be refunded tuppence hapenny for the car rental but I have paid for flights I no longer need despite having requested the booking be cancelled I doubt I will see any of my money back
Avoid Just buy direct from the airline
The company was not forthcoming with information I felt like I was pulling teeth at time Instead of feeling like a worthwhile customer I felt like my requests for information were a nuissance to the person I was working with or else they were bored with their job A more professional service that makes the customer feel valued would be appreciated after I spend over 2000 with your company I had to followup on when the product was going to be shipped after saying that I was in a hurry to receive it Would I get a tracking number More friction than necessary
Canceled policy as received company car sent back insurance never received refund for the extra months that i was entitled to total of nine months may as well have burnt my money at least then i would have gotten some value from it through the small bit of heat it would have given me Not seeing that again and will not be dealing with this crowd again or recommending them to others
Avoid at all costs
Too expensive as calling card
The recurring 50 payments once a month are beyond ridiculous Will be unsubscribing immediately
This company is so full of it 
They send out vouchers to all the states then when ya try to use them they give this BS answer
 As a resident of your state will not permit the use of money off voucher against the purchase of alcoholHoweverWould ya like top open an account
If thats the case why bother to try and solicit business when they damn well know if your state allegedly will not accept a money off voucher 
Be smartstay away from these hucksters 
I purchased a bulb for my rear projection TV from electrifiedcom through Sears I installed the bulb and my TV showed the message projector lamp is nearing end of life need to replace I assumed it was just something on the TV needed to be reset so it knew there was a new bulb in there like an oil change light on a car A month and a half later the bulb stopped working entirely my last bulb lasted 8 years Cannot return bulb due to being outside the 30 day return policy Luckily it was only a 20 bulb But beware of electrifiedcom
We had three products that were broken and one on back order that we werent told about We waited two weeks for my sons bed to be put together and the table we needed to exchange somehow was never scheduled even though we spoke with someone about scheduling an appointment Then someone called me on a Wednesday to confirm Thursday night delivery and Thursday evening I received a phone call that it would be delivered Friday morning when no one was home Then the night we finally were going to get the new table the replacement was also broken The driver then rescheduled our appointment without telling us and it ended up being during the day when we were both at work Very bad experience will not be going back as we spent a lot of money there and were caused unnecessary headaches
Irritated that an extra week has been added to my already long delivery time After reading many brilliant reviews of uberchild I felt confident that although not well known they were a quick and professional company However I find their emails and customer service to be rather blunt and unprofessional
Annoyed that my travel system may not even arrive before my baby is born meaning I will have to spend more money 
Very bad support when I tried to contact the support first they had put the excuse that my account was disabled then they tell me to change the password of my email something totally incoherent pure scam although it seems very real with detours and do not help me to refund Or to reset my password
Very bad support they do not help they do not cooperate not even with something as simple as recovering my password or account
I booked a return flight from Xiamen to Beijing I was scheduled to return to Xiamen on the Monday morning at 640am on the Saturday evening I received a message saying the return flight was cancelled no options for rebooking just that it was cancelled So I contacted Last minutecom who said they didnt know if it was cancelled and would have to check 5 phone calls later the last at 2am with multiple employees telling me I was in the UK when I was actually in Beijing I had to just book another flight myself to ensure I actually got a return flight Throughout this whole experience the staff of last minutecom were completely useless and I now cannot get an answer to any emails regarding a refund for the cancelled flight I will never use Last minutecom Bravofly or any other affiliated company again By far the most clueless unprofessional and out of date company I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with Rip off merchants
Transferring money from PayPal to bank account is too slow Their customer service is third world service with people doing very little to help and are very hard to understand on the phone
Good and fast acess to my storage
Ive been with its4women for a few years always thought I was covered for all scenarios Reading policy and ensuring as a mother id never be caught out your Main Web page states clearly all policies include roadside assistance I have a screen shot as such last month I had a blow out in Dublin City being in a new car I had the puncture pump and no spare the hole was too big for the pump to fill
I rang my road side assistance to be told by an external company I wasnt covered I then had to walk 50mins in the rain across Dublin to put myself and two children on a bus back to Meath while I paid for my car to be towed and wheel changed in Dublin
I gave up and purchased new cartriges Dan
This is my first and last time using this site They lure you in with a price which is misleading You only discover the price is wrong when you actually make the booking Once you are in the process of making the booking all sorts of glitches appear which makes it difficult to access the advertise price  which is the basis of your transaction Once the transaction has been completed the price is much higher than that Quote d and to come out at this stage you need to pay a cancellation fee
They also make a payment calculation in dollars not local currency which is much cheaper
Their business model is based on deception and I cant understand how they get away with it
On time delivery but was charged three times what it was worth I went to a local shop and paid only 4  you charged Me more
You sold me software that you advertised as Windows 10 It isnt Windows 10 its an update to Windows 10 I contacted Microsoft they told me I had to buy Windows 10 in order to install the update But they stated that Windows 10 will not run on Windows XP Professional You advertised it would work To date you have refused to refund me my money That is the last time I do business with this lying company that doesnt have a clue as to what they are selling
The battery wore out and I replaced it but I have not got the system to start working again I bought 2 different batteries and the system simply will not accept them Waste of money except that I needed to install it for insurance because of previous flood
This is the second time I used their service First time it all went like a dream and I was very happy Left a five star review too
This time I booked my partners car She was waiting at home and nobody showed They didnt call either
I used the 0800 number 5 times and couldnt get through to a human Logged the issue via email and they are looking until it
Anyway its 18h15 and the day is gone Wont be using them again They just lost 2 customers
So here is my experience
I carefully checked the Widerrufsrecht which said customers have rights to cancel the contract for no reason within 14 days as required by the law
And it is nicely written as followingWenn Sie diesen Vertrag widerrufen haben wir Ihnen alle Zahlungen die wir von Ihnen erhalten haben einschlielich der Lieferkosten mit Ausnahme der zustzlichen Kosten die sich daraus ergeben dass Sie eine andere Art der Lieferung als die von uns angebotene gnstige Standardlieferung gewhlt haben unverzglich und sptestens binnen vierzehn Tagen ab dem Tag zurckzuzahlen an dem die Mitteilung ber Ihren Widerruf dieses Vertrages bei uns eingegangen ist
All looks very official and reasonable
However after they provided socalled guranteed contacts I found out their match algorithm does not really appear correct So I decided to quite I send the cancellation notice within the period required by them
And I am charged 78 of what I have paid for half year
It is written nowhere
Totally trap
Be careful if you are considering to sign up with them
When you book a car months in advance you expect to have it waiting when you land I had to wait at the desk for 45min before I was served and then it took an hour as they bumbled around trying to bring the car I had ordered when I finally got to the car one of the seats was off its runners I had to call redspot employees to try and fix it 2 separate people tried to fix it and failed At that point they said they would call in another car Frightened by the prospect of having myself and the 5 people traveling with me having to wait another hour I proceeded to fix it myself Needless to say I would be reluctant to use Redspot again
Item arrived faulty Has taken a week for any of my calls to be returned Am now being accused of having worn the faulty item despite having contacted customer services the afternoon the item was delivered to report the fault They refuse to replace faulty goods and are saying that even if I return the item to them I may not get a refund Shocking customer service
I ordered a hoodie on March 3rd and it is now the 30th There is no shipping information on it and no customer service number to call I think this place is a scam I want my hoodie or A FULL refund This company is horrible dont get ripped off like I did ROSEWE is also a scam site China based company ripping tons of people off everday I hope both companies get a class action lawsuit against them for there actions
I called to check on an order I placed on 37 because the ups status showed it still hadnt been shipped I was told someone would get back to me and no one ever did
You reply with you sent tracking status  that is correct however the tracking status never changed from label created That was why I called and that is why the person said they would look into it and get back to me Again no one ever did I stand by my review of poor service
I paid a 92 dollar to start and then when I got to the hertz check out the sheet I received from you the reservation was canceled and was made under another reservation that I did not know about they had me in a volts wagon beetle when I requested an American car or if Ford Focus They did not have anything else available at that time and I was forced to get a different car which I was not happy with but did the service as I did not have time to try and change If I wanted a different car it wouldve cost me a lot more and I also ended up having to pay over 200 in addition to the 92 that I originally paid and was not happy
Food is quite good but delivery times are not good and customer service at least email responses is nonexistent Even though our first weeks box of food was supposed to be free to us because it was a gift from my daughter Hello Fresh charged us the full amount anyway and then did not respond to any of my emails to them asking the charge to be corrected My receipt for my first order showed the charge as 000 but they charged my bank account the full 5994 Delivery times have been from midday on the day of promised delivery to the the day after the promised delivery day We probably are going to be canceling our account with them Too bad because the food and recipes are good
Sometimes skylux is really helpful Other times it is a distasfer
Recently I was sent a confirmation of payment for multiple trips except mid way into my travels I noticed I didnt get my e tickets two days before a trip They had not gotten the tickets yet so I had to buy more expensive ones It was a holiday at an international destination and I couldve been stranded I ended up paying a 15 higher fare and couldve taken better routings
Was Quote d wrong price when sales person took order Only received 1pc instead of 2 Retuned item back for full refund Tracking shows part was received 2 weeks later Still waiting for refund
I just posted a review of Kiwicom
Kiwicom responds claiming they cannot identify my booking and thus cant respond So I added my booking number to my review using the edit feature I then emailed TP asking them if they could inform Kiwicom that my booking number was added to my review but I cannot reach them
Call the number to get information regarding my order and the lady that answered just say she cannot provide it and I must wait until someones call me back  I need the information because was a wrong information provided by ups saying my package was on the warehouse in Hialeah which was on fire some days ago
First attempt to apply the decal didnt stick the did send a replacement The vinyl was tissue thin and I thought I bought the better of the options they offered I will not order again price was inexpensive but you get what you pay for
Item was fine
Overall shopping not geared for single purchase needed by Friday
For delivery price  drop Hermes 
I rented a car through Rentalcarscom and ended getting a car through economy rental who has a F rating with the better business Bureau And ended up being more expensive than most major chains with their mandatory insurance policy 
I ordered two swimsuits online from AMI and they were both in stock 10 days later I finally received shipping confirmation and they advised me that one of the swimsuits was backordered They second suit arrived a week later and it was not what I ordered I contacted the company and they said just keep the one that they shipped in error and asked if I wanted a store credit When I told them no I wanted a full refund their tune suddenly changed They advised me that even though they screwed up the order I would have to ship back the item AT MY EXPENSE in order to get a full credit Even though I used Paypal I was not protected The companys name is DESE Enterprises and if you look at the complaints on the BBB they are famous for ripping off their customers this way They have a F rating with the BBB

when i received my candy some of it was melted unwrapped damaged i didnt have enough candy for my wedding and had to go out and purchase more I wouldnt recommend using this company
Enjoyed the locations we were taken Some activities seemed a little tone deaf and intrusive to the communities we were visiting Guides were friendly and informative barring the below problem
On the ground company running the tour through Cambodia allows for guides and drivers to drink whilst with the group This led to incidents of drinking driving which was unexpected unprofessional and unacceptable
Also the emergency hotline number provided for problems incountry was not answered when called when the tour guide didnt show up after having an accident
Intrepid refunded 2025 of our total booking cost after our return after multiple complaints starting during the tour with a slow response time
I would think twice before traveling with Intrepid again

I dont even want to give them ONE star Appalling This service is a joke I had a friend send me money through my PayPal account that Ive had for years I then had to confirm my email address which for whatever reason could not be done online I called customer service and took care of it Then when I tried to make a payment using my PayPal balance through a site that readily accepts PayPal it not only didnt go through but when I called customer support again they asked me to verify my identity Thats a good thing But the questions they asked we found from public records Now I was asked a question about my halfbrothers wife Simply because she shares my last name Now I have no idea really ANYTHING about her Anyway after some other security questions I was confirmed But they told me that the attempted purchase didnt even show up So I tried to make the purchase through a different merchant Who also accepts PayPal This purchase STILL did not go through It showed up for more than I was trying to spend too So I attempted to put through another smaller purchase with the customer service rep on the phone and the website kept bouncing me to an enter credit card information screen The representative was unable to solve the problem and I couldnt make what was supposed to be an easy online purchase I do not have a valid credit card And even after verifying my bank account I was STILL unable to spend my PayPal balance If I HAD a credit card I wouldnt have been trying to use this service in the first place They didnt do anything that they were designed for I wouldnt recommend PayPal to my WORST ENEMY
Was assured part to be correct Not the case
Had pay shipping both ways Not fair
Poor customer service Stay away from this place
I went to rent a cabin and upon checkout this company added more than 50 of the list price in fees 100 cleaning fee for having 2 dogs Complete ripoff If the place is considered pet friendly include pet cleaning fees in the list price I will never use this pace again
Always freaking late 
Buying delivery ok but not honest about service charges
My friend bought tickets for an Adele concert Each one of us paid more than 800 nzd so we thought our tickets are VIP tickets When the tickets arrived our tickets were only worth 308 each Seriously 500 difference WTF This company should be sued Whoever is behind this company karma will get you So people dont even try this company NEVER
I love you guys and I love your products I usually always shop at your store But your online portal is very poor performance It got so overloaded that 5 times I had to completely shut out of my web browser and then reopen it just to complete my purchase Thats a little bit ridiculous I work in computing as a software tester so granted that I will admit that perhaps my critique on this matter may be a little sharper than the typical end user to your site but at the same time I feel this makes me qualified enough to know what is acceptable and what is not acceptable for an online service
I purchased multiple themes here already Unfortunately the last theme was not as expected so I requested a refund removed all the file and purchased a different theme which was actually what I was looking for
Refund was denied because the author of the theme doesnt want to give us a refund It is very sad to be treated like this after purchasing multiple products there already
This was the last time
Where do I start Lets see first I purchase a Android cable box for 2500 not bad right Then I waited for ever for it to arrive Finally when it does arrive it doesnt even work Turn On When I tried to reach TOMTOP for assistance I am told that all of their items are tested before shipping them out Sure Just like the 1000  1 other items you sold to hardworking customers that did not work I was ensured I would get a new item tic toc it never came I asked for a refund and they gave me the run around YES Finally I get a message that they refunded me my money Oh so I thought because here I sit still checking and guess what NO REFUND SCAM SCAM SCAM Their merchandise is TRASH Stay away from TOMTOP and antiquechina2009 on Ebay They are one in the same
had enough with it
Service is rubbish Takes ages to return your query And the tracker is useless It took 21 days to get my phone unlocked And in the mean time they have slashed their list price by 10 than they originally charged me
I will never use them again
Awful awful
I have called 2 times and still dont have my itinerary yet
The ring took about a month to ship They also sold the diamond I had purchased and offered me a smaller diamond for the same price or a larger diamond for a higher price I am not impressed with the hundreds of clearly fake 5 star reviews I only noticed they were fake after I had ordered which was not pleasant The ring looks great but honestly I would not do business with them again

UNREASONABLE SELLER DISPUTE OUTCOMES
I ordered beams from Architectural Depot on March 10th for a renovation we had to undergo unvoluntarily we were flooded by hurricane Matthew and displaced for 5 months with a newborn baby The site said the arrival of the beams would be between March 23rd and March 28th I went online to track today March 28th and they have not even been shipped When I called and spoke to the rep she said due to the volume the order would be delayed I asked for an ETA or if they could be expedited and she said no she just went on and on about how popular the beams were and thats why they were late Thats great but of no use to me She was unable to answer my question about when the beams would arrive Absolutely terrible practicestheir process of estimating appropriate time arrivals is unacceptable product needs to be shipped when you advertise and even worse customer service to add insult to injury I ordered from this website specifically due to their turnaround If I had known it wasnt accurate whatsoever I would have ordered elsewhere from the more well known online beam source and would have had a more painless experience Im sure Buyer beware
This was the worst experience ever I would not suggest you ever use flight hub to book  in fact I would say pay extra to avoid booking through them
The advertising is not in alignment with actual business practice They DO NOT show you rates online They give your information to other lenders and then you get spammed with phone calls Is there a way to stop the phone calls NOPE
Terrible experience
I cancelled a flight around Christmas time due to a family emergency and they said that I would have a credit on my account The credit amount was 720 When I went to book my new flight of 458 they said they were going to use my entire credit amount and I would be charged an additional 260 This makes absolutely no sense to me I stayed on the phone or over 2 hours on hold waiting to speak with a manager who ultimately did not even attempt to solve the problem NEVER call their phone lines they are unhelpful and the language barrier makes it impossible to discuss the problem at hand
Multiple customer reps get simple sizing questions wrong The size and measurement of the product is literally labelled on the box
By the time the item was delivered the items in were sold out so I was unable to purchase the proper size All that was offered was a 10 off next purchase of which the code wasnt even received
I bought the Thom Browne shirt from Ssense while on sale however turns out Holt Renfrew sale was better for same shirt
My flight was canceled and I received an email from KLM that they would offer an alternative flight In the email they wrote that they aim to contact me within 3 hours They were not reachable by phone I called around 5 times and waited 30 minutes before connection was broken At the service desk at the airport I was recommended to contact KLM through Facebook which I dont have KLM never contacted me I had to book a hotel and buy another flight with Swiss Air 10 days after the canceled flight KLM sent a standard email with an apology but they didnt want to pay back the costs of the canceled flight Very poor service next time I will take another airline if possible
The company Nelson Alexander comes highly recommended They have been prompt with all correspondence and extremely professional Thanks for your support

Have only had one experience with Sortlist as an agency and it has been bad Their site has technical issues and the opportunity I was given was either bogus or poorly screened When I tried to voice my concerns to them they responded with a canned answer Terrible Ive also taken the time to check out their Facebook page and find it unethical that one of the founders of the company has given Sortlist a 5star review If youre a client I suppose youd have nothing to lose If youre an agency thinking of testing a new way to conduct business development stay away from Sortlist
I booked a tripped to Japan a few months ago I first tried FlightHub because it was the easiest route When I went to book my flight I got your flight could not be booked at this time Please try again later I had no reason to believe this flight was booked your website said it wasnt and I did not receive a confirmation email So I went straight to the Airline and booked through them
Long story short I found out by looking at my credit statement that I was charged twice and had a painful experience with the airline and my credit card company to get my money back Thankfully I did
Since then Ive not use this website again until recently because it has the best price Other than this problem I appreciate the cheap prices and the convenience of looking for the best flights for me And your app is well made
Very difficult to find plummer willing to install Only purchased because State Farm theatened to cancel homeowners insurance without install of Flologic Dont know if its working lights are off although connected

I have been a pinterest member for years I am also conservative I have multiple boards on pinterest One is a site for planning for my sons wedding I received several emails from pinterest saying they deleted several of my pins I assume it was to a conservative site Pinterest deleted all my 30 boards I have tried to email pinterest with no responseFor the years and time I spent on pinterest I feel they deleted my board bc I am conservative Please help What do you do
UpdateIt has been a week Pinterest has not bothered to contact me I feel pinterest has stolen my pictures of my boysI pray everyone think again before trusting pinterestespecially with family picturesThe company deactivated my account with no warning They do not care
I have sold back many books with sellbackyourbookcom but my latest experience was extremely disappointing After carefully putting in my books and ISBN numbers which totalled approximately 80 I get an email that my numbers were wrong and the books only were worth 6 I dont know what to make of this but I will not use this site again
Complete joke showed up to the rental place and was refused the car based on insufficient documents even though everything was present according to their terms and conditions on the voucher When contacting customer service they said there would be no refund even though we hadnt even seen the car much less driven the damn thing Im pretty sure most of the reviews on here must be bought because this company is an absolute sham and I am looking forward to getting my money back through a charge back Avoid at all costs
Took 1hr 20 mins for delivery after been told it would take 45 mins  The delivery guy rang and was not near the premises Then there was a language barrier
Buyer Beware when purchasing patio furniture We spent 1400 on a set for our patio After only 2 years the fabric on the furniture has literally begun to disentegrate After contacting customer service we were offered nothing by way of assistance We were told there was originally a 6month warranty from the manufacturer and since that time has passed Sorry theres really nothing we can do at this point This was after asking if there was anything at all they could do ie offer to replace the cushions in question offer contact information for the manufacturer anything at all to help us since it was not a cheap set and lasted a very short amount of time considering the price Had this been a cheap set we would not have this feeling but we expected more out of the set and out of this company Order Information  I1523320

Flowers never arrived gonna ruin mothers day now comany doesnt give a crap
What a Con this site is i won my free bet was told to bet it again before i could claim and when i won that they change the odds so i cant claim it when i asked the apparent online person they shut my acct so they have my original moneywhich i lost as i bet on Haye and the bonus i allegedly won wouldnt recommend them to anyone so why they got the promo for last nights Haye v Bellew is anyones guess there is no complaint service with this site

Booked via TripAdvisor a hotel The hotel was meant to be a 5 star luxury hotel Arrived at the destination and despite having paperwork confirming my 5 star hotel I was told there was no booking for me
I called Amoma customer services who had said their chosen company had made a mistake Amoma have done nothing to help me and I had to go to my credit card company to get my money back
Amoma are just a online platform that farm out your booking to another company If your abroad and it goes wrong there is nothing they can or will do to help if stranded
I recommend booking with more well known companies Rather than risk going abroad and spoiling your trip
There are other reviews I have found regarding this company for the exact same thing
Search all the 1 star ratings and see for yourself
they are not serious they do not aswer e mails no info about nothing i am still expecting my phone and my money i will go to china in few week and if i do not get my staff they will have big broblem with me
My order was scheduled to arrive Feb 27th per Wiggle tracking It didnt arrive until a week later with no explanation of why it was delayed Fortunately this wasnt time critical purchase but an annoying situation nevertheless
I bought a dishwasher online  it arrived  was installed on time However I broke 2 glasses on two occasions because the tray was not adequate to keep them upright I rang DID to advise same  they said theyd get back to me  that was over 4 weeks ago  I continue to hand wash my glasseswould not recommend you buy online
Very professional i will recommend to any one 
The glasses were pretty misshaped and warped and also were displayed in the picture way bigger then they actually are
I had to unfortunately cancel a flight reservation within minutes of making it I called customer service and had the worst experience I can ever recall My initial intention was to rebook it in the am after sorting out a work schedule issue The website clearly states that cancellations within 4 hrs are subject to no fee for anyone and in Canada within 24hrs I painfully tried to explain this to the initial rep and then his supervisor detailing where to go on their website counting paragraphs to guide them to the relevant part of the terms  conditions document and so on It was a terrible experience that lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes recorded on my phone and left me frustrated lacking confidence in the knowledge expertise or courteousy of flighthub employees and unfortunately never wanting to ever use flighthub again There was no apology offered at the end once the supervisor acknowledged that I was right and there was no offer of a compensation for my wasted time and being up until 1am because of this unpleasant experience Disappointment is an understatement
After checking a few sites online I checked out Flighthub as they priced in at almost 12 fare of airline Reviews by trustpilot were high so I proceeded to book Online process was simple enough and as I proceeded I made sure of dates flights all details as it was my first time with this company When all was done I printed out my itinerary I looked at it 5 hours later and was shocked to see the flights booked were a month after I had requested I called Flighthub and spent well over an hour talking to an operator in the Phillipines who at first would do nothing then when she found out it was booked within the last 5 hours she agreed to change but it ended up at full fare plus a 7500 fee They switched dates but I couldnt prove it and so it cost me more money to book through them than the airline itself SCAM
Did not get the car did not refund my money Very unhappy this trip is very unhappy because of car rental also delayed a lot of time Hope Berlin smooth

The esthetics are very appealing but the cables like to pop loose if you touch them If you tighten the cables enough to prevent them from popping loose the brackets that hold the handrail to the top of the posts bend and heaves up
A better rail mounting bracket would easily resolve this issue Considering I paid almost 5000 for the materials for two flights of stairs I should NOT HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM
I have now returned to my clients on 4 occasions to tighten cables
Unacceptable
just returned from the Steigenberger Aqua Magc after 7 days and can only Categorise this into 3 Categories
1 The Good  The Staff at this hotel cannot do to attend to your needs in this Case i am only considering Bar staff Waitersbar and poolRoom staff Chefsand the Animation Team the only people who really matterin making your holiday a success Too many to name here individually they are all very friendlyand spaek to all the GuestsSomething the Management could learn from
these are the hard workers at the hotel and nothing is too much trouble for them the Food was Good and the Service was excellent  Well done 
2 The Bad  The TIles around tthe pool areas are dangerous when wetnot the Correct Tiles at all ateam doing digging at the Hotel Dolphin pool left a lot of debris small piles of concrete at the pool Steps ony after i pointed out that this should be Cordened Off  did they take any action placing Yellow Tape over it
Not a good Advert for Safety Precautions at all
3The Very Very Ugly  just after we arrived we went for Dinner in the Main Restaurant while carrying a plate of Food to my table  i slipped on what can only be described as a gresy patch of Floor both feet went up in the air i landed on the Tile floorhurt my left elbow right ankle when i got up I discovered my left wrist was deeply cut by the Plate the waiters immediately bandaged my wrist and the Manager came over to seeLater while sitting in the Lobby bar the Manager insisted i see the Hotel Doctor  and i use the word Doctor very loosely he insisted i needed stitches  i maintained i did not as the wound was gelling together ok  but against my wishes he put in the so called stitches he seemed more interested in money matters than his Hippocratic Oath he wanted me to go back the next day i did not to me he was a Veternarian not a doctorhe spent more time farfing about than giving me Medical attention
On the day that we were leaving and checking Out the Management of the Hotel tried to stick me with a bill for 25000 I refused to pay it  as the Hotel was responsible for the accident i had and the Doctor put in stitches i did not want or Need
One of the Managers tried to insist i pay this billeven trying to rattle me
by saying they would get the police  i told them no bother its a civil matter  not a criminal one
They even took off the Transfer bus  my luggage and my partners who had no connection with this and locked it in a storage room again trying to rattle me
The General Manager got involved and only when i got the Guest Relations Manager who was in the doctors office with me  and confirmed with her that i did not want or need stitches  only then did the Management back down and I DID NOT PAY
As the Transfer bus had now left without us i insisted that the Hotel get and pay for a taxi to the Airport after some more wrangling with them
they then agreed to do so Where was the Thomas Cook Rep he was nowhere to be seen  did not appear and told me to sort it out myself he was as much use as a Chocolate Teapot totally useless
This is not a good Advert for this Hotel and i would like to see DIETER G General Manager reply to this review or does he only reply to good reviews
Ordered their super gloss cards
The edges are cut so badly they are unusable Already delaminating
Totally unfit for purpose
Ive opened a complaint and require a refund as I simply cannot give these to customers as they are embarrassing
Just because I reviewed one of your companies doesnt mean I want you emailing me And no way to unsubscribe B
Cheap domain names but try and contact them for support and youll reach a brick wall
Every single email address on the website bounces back as address not found and they provide no telephone support Ive been waiting on the online chat service for hours
Avoid
Just made a reservation the system duplicated the reservation and debited twice my credit card Since then Im trying to contact the client service no email address just a phone number in Spain and nobody is answering Its unacceptable that there is no way to send a quick noteemail to the client service in order for them to fix this
I waited 1015 minutes at a locked office door because I was told by the phone operator that theyd be open for the next hour  I was 1012 minutes away
When the agent got to me she told me that shed charge me extra because she could not sogn me up before her shift ended I should come back another day
I went to one of your competators and signed up in less than 15 minutes for a much cleaner facility at a lower price
Thank you for turning me away with poor customer service
My insurance went from 460 to 830 I left 4 messages to be called back and No one rang me back It was like they didnt want me to resign with them So I had no choice but to go elsewhere
UK buyers beware  returns are at your cost and must be shipped to Canada Doesnt say anywhere on the website that returns are going to be international
I ordered an Garmin Approach 2 gps golf watch It was obviously a return item The packaging was damaged and busted when opened the watch had been hurriedly stuffed in and the settings had been set before To be fair i used the watch because i needed to and found it to be working ok but i would have returned it if it hadnt been required at the weekend

Sorry posted by accident
I know its not your fault but your courier service did not deliver the item I followed the tracking service and they said they had attemped to deliver and i was unavailable at 1104 am The address i supplied is a school we were open i was available all day there was no card or notice left I had to go to several locations to track down the order it was not at my nearest Post office So as you can see my experience was not a good one and does warrant a two star rating
Gerry
Overall very nice representatives but their phone wait times are aweful Always takes long to get through I waited an hour once
Very unhappy with Harvey Norman service Unfriendly staff at Naas branch Was mistake done buy Harvey Normanfor which nobody apologized even I was meant to collect item the next day and it was allowing to order and pay onlineclick and collect that wasnt true after traveling to Naas store where it was showing online that the product is available that wasnt true it wasnt thereI Had to wait more than a week before they delivered it to Naas store this item was a present for my mother which isnt getting received for her Birthday because of delay So dissapointing and very sad over dealing with your storeWont recommend to anyone
I thought I was using the Consumers Report car price service but that doesnt exist anymore Instead I got switched to the True Car scam This is just a bad fixed price referral service where you the buyer get tricked into a bad fixed price for a car and the dealer gets a premium price without any negotiating and True Car gets a 400 referral fee for nothing DO NOT USE TRUE CAR DO NOT CLICK ON ANY TRUE CAR INFORMATION NEVER GIVE YOUR NAME OR EMAIL ADDRESS TO TRUE CAR THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT GET A GOOD DEAL IS THE DEALER AND TRUE CAR NOT YOU
I ordered a top in mid January and after 2 months I still have not received it even though the tracking says it was shipped I have sent messages and nothing was done I wouldnt advise anyone to order from this company
I paid 200 per ticket when I received the download the actual ticket price was 4850 Wow However seats were amazing
When I signed up with Energia I was told I could get my bill at the start of every month but after talking to a Energia team member on the phone I was then told this was not possible I asked to speak to a manager and the Energia team member said a manager would contact me
The same day I got an email saying that Energia would contact me in the next ten days
This did not happen and when Energia did contact me they said there is nothing they can do as it was outside their control but they would wave the 50 leaving fee
Its just cost me around 39 to pay just over 1000 to someone  will do a bank transfer next time Much cheaper
overpriced products and expensive post and packaging I only use this crowd if I have no other choice
Today my LG G4 phone refused to start working it appears to have bricked and is completely unresponsive Having looked online this appears to be a common problem with the LG G4 to which LG have admitted
The rest of my story is the reason why you should never buy an LG phone or possibly any other LG product
I rang the LG Repair Centre and on my first call they asked for the IMEI number printed inside the phone On giving this I was told that mine was a Taiwanese phone and as such not covered by the warranty  apparently the components are different Really LG Why does it work anywhere in the world then LG refused to repair the phone or even to take the phone back to repair it if I offered to pay The phone is one year and three months old and in otherwise perfect condition LG said my only recourse was through the online retailer from whom I purchased
So I looked up the online retailer then called the LG Repair Centre back This time I was told that LG would not honour the warranty because my retailer had bought the warranty from LG so my only recourse was back through that retailer I have subsequently found that the retailer is no longer trading Hard luck on me
Interestingly in neither call did LG ask how old the phone was they were keen to use other excuses than the phone being out of the warranty period I wonder why
Finally the LG representative said that if I was prepared to pay for the repair then I could send the phone to a third party and gave me a name and number with whom I could get the phone fixed Nice
So to recap
 The LG G4 is a top of the line mobile and has a known fault to which LG have admitted
 But LG will use different excuses as to why they will not repair the phone under warranty eg its Taiwanese different or the retailer bought the warranty
 LG will also not repair your device even if you offer to pay but will refer you to a third party
LG this is very poor You are not taking any responsibility for producing a faulty design selling it to unsuspecting customers that buy in good faith and then refusing to provide any redress As a company your attitude stinks and I would urge all my friends in fact anyone out there not to buy an LG phone or any other LG device because they simply dont stand by their products
You have been warned Please share
I declined an outfit in February I did not know I was charged anyway until I got my credit card bill later that month
I sent these to my fianc and he never received them It said they were delivered and yet he never got the cupcakes So disappointing
when the original delivery was turned away from a hospital on health and safety grounds they contacted me so i gave them an alternative delivery address the flowers never arrived there either and there was no mention of a refund or apology
Surely as the alternative address was in the same town it would have been easy to change delivery free of charge
The dress I ordered was horrible nothing like the picture in terms of colour fabric and shape I dont like the attitude of the website Claiming things like clothing returned after later than two weeks will be returned to you and we do not cover delivery costs for returns gives a very unwelcoming sense to the website
Rented out in less time and for free on gumtree with a lot more interest I wish i had saved my money
You have ruined our Valentines Day The only thing that you need to do was deliver the flowers on 14th of Feb between 8am6pm  Even in Turkey when I order something they are able to deliver it less than 24 hours from 1000km far away but you couldnt be able to achieve deliver some bunch of flowers just in London within 10 hours and now my girlfriend just had to organise a redelivery The package was flowers and now the condition of flowers is getting worse each second I hope you can achieve to deliver it at 15th of Feb Your company has been such a disappointment for me and my girlfriend
Groupon has 2 problems
1 Most of its vendorsservice providers despise Groupon because Groupon takes a huge cut from them for bringing customers to the business As a trickle down effect some of these vendors offer substandardsecond hand service to the Groupon customers Groupon also hardly vets businesses and whether the business is even open for service at all
2 So when a customer who has a bad experience or has a worthless trip to use the purchased voucher contacts customer service they go for another bad experience First of all there is always a long wait All customer service folks have a standard preformatted reply They do not even read the complaint transcript instant chat or complaint email In most cases however their standard response is that some nonexistent committee at Groupon would look into the matter and someone would get back to you in 34 business days However nobody ever contacts back and you are left to contact Groupon again and wait in the long queue
A Groupon experience is a hit or a total miss depending on your luck
I reached out to costumer service in order to figure out when to order my new fruit trees such that they would arrive for planting season My three trees arrived in the middle of winter February in Pennsylvania Needless to say I now have three dead fruit trees

Please note that the jacket you will receive is nothing like the one on the picture I did not expect high end quality considering the price but also did not expect such bad quality It is not worth it Do not recommend this purchase at all
Make international order X1339477101 on this site but received some trash instead my parka Support decline all my proof about this situation ignore almost all my mail and say nonsense in callservice Terrable service Never ordered again in this store and talk all of my friends about this
On March 4th I ordered a mans ring size 10 shipping date March 17th I got an email 2 days before stating that they shipped out the wrong size and that they sent the ring back and that I would get the new ring on Monday or Tuesday of the following week well no ring came so I called customer service and got the answering machine and left a message for them to call me back and got no call back I went into the store in Lindsay and the girl told me that theres was nothing they could do at store level because I ordered it online and told me to call customer service and I told her that I did that and that was why I came to the store because no one has bothered to call me back she said to keep trying Someone needs to make this right at least a call back and take ownership of the mistake that was made
Please cancel my order
Your sight makes no mention of a service fee until after payment I dont think this is an honest practice I will most likely cancel this reservation and call the property directly
Ordered Oakley Metal Plate frames Provided credi card details billing address and shipping address were same That wasnt sufficient for them and they requested additional proof Understand they operate out of Hong Kong so I thought why should I trust them with my card details In any case I provided the additional proof but not happy I know their lame excuse will be that allows them to protect the customer Emails from their security and customer service department were poorly written Even their automated emails arent professionally written I would NOT recommend them to anyone If you dont trust your customers why should we trust YOU Received a pathetic apology
Your business seems set up like a scam to keep my money There is no app and the mobile site is not user friendly The skip the month option is only visible in the first 5 days of the month I was told i cant cancel my subscription without using my credits And when i went to use the credits i was already charged for I can only use them in increments of 59 Im extremely disappointed and I will be telling everyone i know
We have stayed at Outrageous Cabins numerous times and typically had a good experience However our last stay was very disappointing The heat stopped working in our cabin and I called Outrageous Cabins Instead of taking care of the issue themselves they gave me the number for the HVAC company I literally spent the next 4 hours either on the phone with the technician trying their recommendations to fix the unit and ultimately waiting for an after hours technician to arrive Outrageous Cabins did not offer us anything in the way of apologies  nor were any discounts next stay offers etc offered We felt it was their responsibility to fix the problem but they made us take care of it There are plenty of options when it comes to cabin rentals and while we will certainly continue to go to Gatlinburg we probably wont use Outrageous Cabins again
The checkout process was frustrating I would add something to my cart then try and checkout and the item would disappear when I would try to checkout
I wasnt really happy I ordered things and I didnt get them the way I ordered
I would give zero stars if that were an option I got a free wine voucher When I tried to use it the voucher did not go through So I was charged 106 dollars worth of wine When I called to see why it did not go through the customer service lady I was on the phone with was polite and helpful at first but when I explained the issue her attitude changed right away to rude condescending and very nasty She told me it was all my fault cause I didnt follow the instructions properly when there were no clear or any instructions to follow in the first place I was hoping to be able still use the voucher on the wine I had been charged for and just add on the 60 dollars I would need but then she accused me of trying to get the wine I already ordered for free I would never do such a thing Also I was put down as a member without being notified until after the fact I would have loved to be a member when I would have been able pay for it but given what just happened and the other reviews Ive read I would never become a member Im sure there are other wine companies that I can join when the time comes She voiced her joy in kicking me off the membership list when I asked her to take me off the membership list She also used the excuse that my email were going into my spam folder which is complete BS because I checked my spam folder and nothing from naked wine I notice they use that excuse a lot when theyre also respond to negative reviews Total smokescreen Knowing what I know now and how poorly I was treated on the phone I would never become a member or would I buy from them either All I wanted was for my voucher to go towards the wine I already order and to just charge me 60 dollars more wine which they refused Now I out 100 dollars and they dont care because it is clear theyre just a crooked business that only cares about getting people money
PS I dont live in the state of Texas anymore I live in New Mexico now So my voucher should have counted
I think its incredibly sneaky to hide additional costs in the check box section after youve entered your payment details If transparency was your aim these would be highlighted before getting to this stage to make it easier to spot and also amend your booking to counteract the costs I was also refused the companies official complaints procedure when I contacted them Wont use again you can negotiate the same deal or better directly with the rental company or use a cashback website and get it cheaper
correct number sent in but keys i received not work
Get charged for excess km when in the terms stated unlimited km
The intermediate bank you chose turned out to be very expensive Nearly twice the cost of your service So their greed has tarnished your service Its up to you to sort this out if you want people to use your service Are you not aware of their costs There is no point in using you in future If I transfer via my own bank which I have done in the past at least I know what I am getting and paying for Why did you have to route via an additional bank at the destination in any case Strange indeed
Ive never had problems with receiving my order but this time I never received it
Its been over 14 days and Ive written to costumer service 2 times both times I just got the same answer That my package would arrive shortly It didnt
Now they wont answer me and they wont give me my money back
I am so angry And due to this lack of good customer service I intend to never order from them again

I booked my car in for A Full Service  Mot for the second year I got a Good price My car was arranged to be picked up by a local garage between 8am and 10am I waited until 10am but noone turned up to collect my car I phoned servicing stop and explained the situation I was left on hold so that they can contact the garage I was told that they could not get an answer and there is nothing they can do so leave it an hour to see if the car gets collected I waited for an hour  still no show Phoned servicing stop again and was told that they still can not get in touch with the garage their phone is just ringing out I was informed that my case will be handed over to my service adviser who will keep trying to contact the garage and call me back I waited until 5pmand had to call servicing stop again as I did not get any call back from them They apologised and said that they have been unable to contact the garage all day and that the garage has acted in a very unprofessional manner I was told that an adviser from servicing stop will arrange for me to call me back to rearrange the appointment I took the day off work especially for my car to get serviced and Motd and did not want to risk this happening again so told them that I do not want to rebook and have now arranged my service and mot elsewhere I feel like I have had an entire day wasted and I hope that Servicing stop do review and discontinue using garages like the one they selected for me as they have now lost me as a customer I had a 5 star Review for servicing stop last year but due to this unacceptable experience I have had to change it to 1 star
Last years 5 Star Review
I booked my car in for A Full Service  Mot I got a Good price My car was picked up by one of the garage employees within stated time he left his car at my home and took my car to the garage I got a phone call from servicing check to say my car failed its MOT and they gave me a price for the repairs I knew that all the parts that were needing replaced were required as they were advisories on my last MOT I agreed to get the repairs done immediately got the online link to pay via email Quick and easy to pay online Car returned shortly after 6pm slightly later than the time given but I didnt mind as I know from experience how bad traffic is at that time I got my service book back all stamped with Mot Certificate and service paperwork This is the first time I have used Servicing Check the agents I dealt with were friendly and the service was great I have already booked my car in for its service and MOT for next year
Im very dissapinted as I was a HUGE fan of BOOKINGCOM so far Unfortunatelly it seems that company grow to the point that cant handle anymore with all customers and dont care about them Recently I booked a hotel in Mexico and was partly charged straight away after even during booking process nothing was mentioned about that I got this information together with booking confirmation It wasnt a big problem for me till moment when I decided to change my plans and cancel this booking First of all I contacted Bookingcom after couple of days asking when refund wil be make I was ensured that it would be very shortly and I will be informed about that After couple of days of silence Ive contacted them again and surprisingly was asked for proof of this charge Of course I provided my statment and again was ensured that refund will be proceed shorly After other couple of days I was informed that refund has been done already and I need to wait 15 week later without any updates I called again and found out that hotel couldnt proceed refund because my bank blocked it JOKE at the same time I was informed that case was escalated to Finance department and someone will contact me shortly to proceed refund this time by BOOKINGCOM itselfWell again silence no email replies ets Today I called them again and was informed that refund will take AT LEAST 2 ANOTHER WEEKS Well I just want to say that its very sad and dissapointing when trusted and good company changing so badly I will think twice before making another booking with them

SAVE YOUR MONEY RUN AWAY
I tried to modify my agreement by 21hrs and they were going to charge me an extra 140 for a compact Wow
The female sales rep was great The woman at the checkout counter was not We were originally there to pick up Moana that i purchased online and qualified for a free flashlight Because I also had a 300 purchase that night I qualified for a free basketball The woman at the counter acted annoyed barely staid a word but have us dirty looks when we asked if we could get the flashlight and basketball She turned and placed the basketball on the counter and said there you gothe first thing she said to us at this point Then I asked again if I could use my coupon I received for the flashlight when I purchased Moana She rolled her eyes reached under the counter and placed a small box on the counter and said all we have is orange in a very rude tone I said that was just fine said thank youwith no response back and we walked away Ive never been treated more rudely there and definitely when I just made almost a 400 purchase after delivery fees I will not return to the Murray location Ill drive the extra miles to the Draper if I go back to RcWilley
Not good Rudes staff and disrespect staff
Well never again

Order placed 27 Feb and paid in full 9 March and still waiting to receive item
Ordered new service was misled on equiplmet I was to receive was told would get a gift card that will not happen  and finally none of the movie channels were on my service as promised The installer was embarrassed because they had screwed up on my order so badly Had to contact dish net work directly in Phoenix to get it all straightened out The installer took 4 hours because the order was so messed up He was the only good part about my experience Still will not get the gift cert That I was promised
CAVEATagain on the phone for hours and days when someone finally answers then they have a patronizing unhelpful attitude they make it impossible not to have surcharge over surcharge they only have service stations that are more than an hour away their website in undependable at best Never again I would never recommend this company to anyone CAVEAT
I ordered only a frame to replace a damaged frame I was disappointed when the frame arrived and I discovered that they cut the frame 18 larger in both dimensions than the size I specified I called and was told that was their standard practice to ensure that the artwork would fit There is absolutely NO mention of this on their website I explained that my artwork was already smaller than the frame size I ordered and it would now have a poorer fit but the sales rep was very unapologetic and made no offer to correct the problem In the end I ordered another frame but used dimensions 18 smaller It cost me an extra 40 and Im not very happy about it It is not likely I will do business with them again
My first order was processed quickly and was very good My second order was never delivered and I have contacted them many times since the scheduled delivery date and have only received generic responses with no action to resolve the issue I hope to eventually get my money back but things are not looking good so far Update I did get my money back finally
I ordered a pair of glasses weeks ago and havent been able to get a refund and have not received them
Things I ordered were missing stuff cheap looking
I bought a ticket on Feb 6 and messaged them 5 times about my order and have gotten 0 response There is no phone number or social media handle either
The flowers I ordered for Mothers Day to be sent to Spain have still not been delivered and we are now Day 5 after the delivery date Mothers Day was 2 days ago so now too late after the event although I would still like her to receive flowers There is no contact telephone number here in the UK and I am really upset that noone has contacted me after submitting three of Floraqueens online reports Will not be using again and will not recommend I have had many flowers delivered to Spain and will go back to using those companies Disgusted and upset
Rep on the phone was trying to charge me more for my tickets than was on the web page Really didnt try to help me find a better price at all
Call me I book said they would email me confirmation nothing received
Book was in great condition when shipping Keep in mind this was shipped in a box 4 times the book with packaging foam Received an email saying they cant accept it because of the spine is broken The were kind enough to return it without shipping charges but damaged my book On top of this I received it in a BAG WITHOUT ANY PROTECTIVE FOAM Now I wont even bother to deal with these frauds
I calle yesterday to see if the facility was going to be open was told yes I drove over there and the plase is CLOSED so I drove from Los Angeles and came back empty handed THANKS A LOT I do work some holidays but Otay Crossings close On most time to see options
I was charged for an item that was sold out The website states I will be issued a refund for 21623 after 13 days and no refund I contacted Groupon only to be told the transaction never actually happened But my American Express bill shows the deduction They are denying my refund and were not hepful at all
Poor at first and then better
I had a call to advise my braclet was ready for collection Went to the store and the chain wasnt fixed Therefore had to wait another week
I had a call after waiting more than 2 weeks to get my braclet back
The young male staff member had problems finding my repair had to seek help from older female staff member
I had reservations when collecting my braclet and the way in which it had been fixed was different to how it had been before I walked away and thought about whether to have it redone or accept the repair I did come back to the store on the same day and took my repaired braclet home
In my opinion The female staff member was good the young male staff member was not so good in looking after a customer and accepting payments
Perhaps staff need to terrines how repairs are managed and how to accept payments
I was excited to give a set of labels as a gift The website indicates that orders take 2 business days to process and shipping takes up to 10 business days But I ordered the labels a week ago and have yet to receive a shipping notification I would expect to have received some sort of communication by now At this rate the labels will arrive too late to be of any use to the recipient Im hoping this is just a glitch and the labels will arrive on schedule
This company is a total disaster no wonder they have such a bad reputation
Screwed us on refund returned 100 out of 550 owed for the flight avoid avoid avoid 
I bought a figurine from them 6 weeks ago until now still havent receivedwrite email to their customer support request for refundand they doesnt seem want to refund me and want me to wait for another weekI am really angry right now
I paid for and was invoiced for the size I requested I recieved the wrong size and they offered no reasonable resolution I will not recommend or purchase from them again
Of course someone replied to me with a link to the tracking website thinking it would make a difference I got scammed DO NOT BUY FROM THIS WEBSITE Some people get lucky and actually get stuff most do not My order number is DLNI3844W I would like a refund
Nothing worked and slow slow response that offered no help
Had several items in my cart Clicked the button to check for coupons and set up an account as it asked but it cleared my shopping cart So I had to start over Then I accidentally clicked the wrong color on one of the light covers I was ordering and I could NOT get it to delete from the cart I tried several times to change the quantity to 0 and update the cart but nothing happened Also tried clicking the box under the x thinking that might remove it and clicking update cart but it never would So now I have an extra light cover I dont really need Then the shipping turned out to be 15  almost as much as the order For standard shipping And to top it all off because of all the trouble I had I forgot 3 items I needed to order But now I dont really want to go back and order them because Im not willing to pay another 15 in shipping to get them Very frustrating experience with the online order

Thermostatic Shower Panel Tower System with over head shower handheld and body sprays January 19 2013 It was not installed until Aug 8 2013 It was supposed to be warranted for 10 years On Feb 14 2017 the 3 way diverter broke Was advised that the part was not warranted so we purchased the diverter Sent a diverter that looked incorrect With instructions that did not represent our tower Then sent 2 more instructions They insisted it was correct and told us to install it Which we did and it did not work It has now been 14 days and they asked for a movie to show the problem Have not heard a response to date This is the worst company we have ever had to deal with DO NOT trust their warranty or their staff to help when something goes wrong I will never buy from Hudson Reed again and will not recommend them for their product or their after service
They dont stand behind what they sell Very rude on the phone Purchased a gel mattress for my father and after only two days its flat and doesnt work They wont replace or have anything to do with what they sell Dont buy from them
Decent quality products but just a terrible company Every aspect of it is designed to cheat customers out of money Monthly subscription format is perfect for taking money out from under members noses Very difficult to skip a month and avoid getting charged A credit is worth about 50 if your order total comes out below a multiple of 50 you will be charged the difference even if you have adequate credit in your account to cover it This forces you to either pay that difference or order more to cover it and make the difference smaller Waited for hours to speak to customer service before giving up Absolutely brilliant business model in terms of making easy money I will not be doing business with Fabletics again

We had to go through our bank to get our deposit full cost of the rental back Hotel information was misleading  falsely advertised The hotel wanted additional payments and fees that totaled over 90 of the rental itself This was not mentioned in the email or the two2 times I called to confirm our reservation While waiting in the lobby to resolve our problem another customer was denied TOILET PAPER and was told to go buy it at the store by the front desk Both the hotel and BookItcom refused to refund our deposit We did not stay at their clients hotel DO NOT USE THIS SITE
The vehicle I was give was not safe to drive at highway speed due to under inflated tyres
F rating with the BBB Dont buy from them They wont deliver your flowers and will not give you a refund
Car and pickup was fine except a bit of damage on vehicle but its been 19 days and still waiting on my deposit to be given back I wouldnt use redspot again due to this unessisary inconvenience
I ran the driver updates and now my computer does not work correctly I cant see email attachments hear my voicemails open certain pages and see the content
This service is a rip off and conveniently there is no one you can talk to in order to fix the issues that their program caused
Order a phone charger and waited The item never came I have had to wait before for items so after waiting a couple of months and when I messaged groupon they said there wasnt anything they could do No refund no credit for another Groupon item The item that never showed up is still for sale on their site
first timeanyway to get white and smaller height
It kept giving me the wrong prices at checkout so I had to call and spend 30mins on the phone trying to work it out The representative kept arguing that the leggings I chose are not the 2 for 24 price when it clearly was showing me that they were She even deleted one of my items from my cart before asking me just assuming I wouldnt want it now I had to ask her to put it back into my cart and keep asking her to check the price again If its advertised for that price they have to give it to us She eventually put me on a brief hold to figure it out andor ask somebody and came back to finally tell me that I was right My total order was 4000 as it should be which is a BIG difference from the 9000 it was originally charging me This whole process took WAY TOO LONG After too much time spent on problems on the site and the long phone call it took a total of over an hour just to place this one small order Very unacceptable I will never order from here again  
after 5 plus years I have to find another provider Its time Things should get better not worse
I bought hockey tickets to go see my team play First game in YEARS Im sure someone could imagine my excitement I paid a coupled hundred dollars for the tickets and wanted to get a new jersey I placed my order for a hat and a jersey on 1 March and paid for 3 day shipping My custom jersey was shipped on the 2nd A few minutes ago I checked on the status of my jersey and it said it wasnt going to be delivered by COB on 10 March THE HOCKEY GAME IS ON THE 9TH So obviously something doesnt make sense here I spent all of that money and this crappy company cant do SIMPLE math If my order shipped out on the 2nd the latest it shouldve arrived at my house is today Thats me adding an extra day in there because of Sunday Im not sure how you guys are still in business Ill be reporting you to the BBB
After booking flight I got no confirmation of the booking at all
Ordered Brooks Brothers sunglasses 4 weeks ago Still have not received them
I made a mistake and chose the wrong carrier I was charge and I receive and error message and lost the funds You should be given an option to correct the mistake
Wow  bad bad experience
sent my car in for cheapest service which includes chaning the fuel filter etc and now i have sent them almost 20 emails to tell me what they have changed as a part of the service  no response
Failed the MOT and Quote d me 755 for the work Took to another garage who actually specialised in BMWs and got it OEM parts and labour for 350
Thats gets me thinking  did they actually service my car given that they are not responding to my emails on specifics  Who is to say they did not do anything with the car There is no way to verify
Avoid avoid avoid
They decided to not buy one of my boxes of a 100 trst strips bc of they way i took my info off that is fine However i would like that box back Ive called emailed etc asking it be returned and i havent gotten any response back Also i was only paid for one of my boxes of lsncets and i never got the 10 bonus I hope that we can resolve this
I got the key It is way to big for the keyhole When I called back they said it is the correct key even though it is not and will not give me my money back They just sent me a article on how to spray wd40 in the hole and then try it Well when the key is too big you cant fix that with wd40
We received one item that we ordered but not the other
I wanted what I thought was a simple system An autodialer for my sales reps to log in and manage their accounts with some CRM and QA components that would help management track progress
Our scheduled training was very difficult to get through as the presenter was unprepared and not very familiar with the product itself A lot of terms that are familiar within the telecommunications industry was used that sales people are not familiar with
Something then was changed in the core programming to make it so the call notes and interaction notes would not display Also the history and activity on the fight side of the screen no longer displayed the notes This was 1 of the 2 things I asked if the software could do so essentially this change killed 50 of the usability for us
On the plus side when I asked for a different trainer I was provided one who spent a lot of time to help us set up the campaigns and research our issues However ultimately this is a review of the product itself and it didnt work for us on the most basic level
Purolator customer service and service itself is the worst Incompetent service Unprofessional I was waiting and wasted my days waiting for non existing delivery 3 TIMES Waste of time
We were flying from Miami to Frankfurt We booked our tickets months before When checking in at the Airport we were told that unfortunately we were not seated together
Four rows with 11 and 13 rows between each stats My 8 and 12 year old boys were sad and scared We Are from Danmark so they speak very little English and no German At the way to USA the 8 year old was flightsick and was trowing up who should manage this The French lady next to him
At the checkin desk and at the gate we met no understanding At the flight we met a nice flightattendand who helped us and other families with same problem She arranged so we sat two and two
Why does this problem accure It is not nice for your personel who have the challenges at the flight to find the solutions
You can see it is a family with children travelling together before seating the flights
Who should explain and translate the safety onboard procedures for the children when they are left by themselves by Lufthansa
It was the same problem for another family when we were travelling with our next Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to Copenhagen They were split up and one of the children weekend crying so the were calling the father at the speaker
Luckely we were with SAS at the way to USA
Sanne  Denmark
I received a cancellation notice on a flight called Help desk He said flight was cancelled He looked up another flight for 425 something when I could see the same flight on the web for 325 something I rebooked the same flightbut had to pay 130 more
Thanks for nothing except paying more

Biggest complaint is that you only ship UPS which is the worst shipping company ever They would not allow me to redirect shipment to a UPS store Fed Ex did when I was in WSJ Wine club got out of it because I joined this one You need to allow the use of FedEx or any shipping company the customer wants I had to pay for wine that I could not accept at home because UPS only delivers when I am at work which was shipped back I then had to pay a restock fee then had to pay to have it shipped back to a UPS store which charged me 10 to pick it up All in all 6 bottles of wine that was supposed to cost about 90 cost me about 180 RIDICULOUS
I ordered a specific part and they sent the wrong one Didnt know until I already put my car in the shop and was at work I get a call and they already charged me for labor to break it down so I had to buy the brakes through their shop
The flowers I pick wasnt what look in the picture and they were a day late
It says first outfit 15 but of course my summary says I was charged more IF this is the way this works then I will be cancelling quicker than I though
I manage an ecommerce store and cant believe Oldies have the nerve to send orders out without a tracking number I cant believe that For some reason this has something to do with it being international you would think a tracking  would be even MORE important in that case All I wanted was a USPS tracking number so I could at least see when my order left the US and they dont even do that for international orders I have NO way of knowing where my order is other than it has shipped and now I just sit and wait for 28 weeks In the event that my order doesnt arrive in that ridiculously wide amount of time what do I do then
Order never came
I decided against better judgement to use this company to locate a loan company for me Hector Rivas called and had selected one that was supposed to assist me in getting the loan After going thru the process which took over a wk I was told I could not get the loan I contacted Hector to voice my disappointment To this day I still have not heard from him again How can you have such bad customer service such as this Not even a response to your emails or phone calls How can you respect someone that cant even return a email
I have not received my orders and there is no live chat I guess I should have done my research I also have a double order for the same item that I cannot delete You cannot track them either
I bought a dress with beading on it It came to me missing beads and they were not in the packing so they must have fallen off before even making it into the box I tried on the dress and lost 3 more by just trying it on I didnt even sit in it Can you Imagine the amount of beads that will be lost dancing in it I contacted customer service where I was directed to their bead policy in their terms and conditions I do understand beads may fall off but to have them missing on a dress before you receive it even is ridiculous I was offered replacement beads and 40 not even 10 of the cost of the dress for it coming not intact I was offered a full refund which I might have done if my wedding day wasnt just a month away I was offered to switch it for the same dress but with a warning it may happen again I think it shouldnt be common place to receive a dress missing pieces My concerns I felt were just blown off like that is just how it is I know Peaches didnt make the dress but they do choose to sell it and they could let the maker know the issues so it can be addressed
Update 221 The replacement beads they sent were 6 beads they picked up off the floor from other dresses and dont even match the 12 beads missing off my dress This retailer is a joke
Unhelpfull I never got the car and they didnt refund me I only lost time and money
i sold 3 tickets befor 3 month and till now i did not get any money
they are liyer they only tell we will check and reply to you and never get any reply
very bad they will eat your money dont sale with them
Was promised a five dollar discount from my review Never received it or do I have any idea how to claim it
I used my reward coupon to order an item online But then received an email stating the item was on backorder so they cancelled my order Didnt even give me the option to wait for the item It just made me feel like this reward coupon isnt really a reward coupon but just an excuse to try to get me to spend more money at rcwilley False and deceiving
A friend recommended Transferwise to me to support my business selling in Germany from the UK and having to change Euros into Pounds
This went well for about eight months I transferred my revenue back to the UK and Transferwise earned a decent return on their fees
Then in October they asked me to verify some more information and provide invoices which I did
However instead of doing it a logical time they waited until I sent a large transfer and then stated we now need paperwork and until then your transfer hangs in the balance This is absolutely unacceptable behaviour If you want to verify I am happy to do that However to intentionally wait to ask until I send money and then delay my transfer by one week is borderline harassment Why can you not ask for this information before or after an active transfer
But it gets better after the Christmas break I tried to log in and noticed my information was not being recognised I called up customer service who stated she did not know what it is possibly a technical error and advised me to send an email to their appeals team
I emailed the appeals team stating that I could not log in and whether they knew the reason for it I then got this response
Your appeal has been reviewed and our response in this matter remains the same Your TransferWise account has been deactivated and we will not be able to process any further payments tofrom your account
This was my first email and I was not appealing I did not even know my account was closed So at one point TW decided to close my account and did not bother to notify me in advance during or after the deed that it was done Also they refuse until this day to explain why they did it and their behaviour in this instance is on par with PayPal that has a rating of 15 on this website To round it all up I was then finally given the template TC answer
Please keep in mind this is our final response in this matter
If you are not satisfied with the response you have the right to forward it to the Financial Ombudsman service in the following 6 months latest by the 12th of July 2017
If TW would not try to make themselves out as a honest broker that cares about consumers and consumer rights and advocates on Facebook for citizens to get involved I would have said never mind just another blood sucker but the fact that they pretend to be this righteous proconsumer organisation really bugs me
Until this day TW has not responded or explained why my account was closed I also still do not know when this was done
Very delayed shipments
This is my first time using FlightHub
I just had my interlock installed last week I already have been told I need to take my car BACK to the center to have an update done on my device I cant even drive yet Ridiculous they make you drive more than you should considering the circumstances So far Im not happy with this service
Hi I am a customer based in Denmark Europe
I bought a lamp specified to measure 60 cm in their page and in the technical specification But the actual lamp received only measure 48 cm this is a major quality problem and I simply cannot use the lamp So I requested the return of the item
Major problems are
1 Lightinthebox is not willing to reimburse me for the return shipping costs this is approx 65 EUR Meaning the cost to return the item from Denmark to their warehouse in Poland
2 Lightinthebox is not willing to reimburse me for the original shipping cost from China to Denmark that was approx 65 EUR
3 The service center takes 45 days to respond to my claims via their ticket system Even though they promise a fast response of less than 24 hrs my experience has been 120 hrs
Ticket ID 14838223
Order Number 1701160821185036
At the moment Lightinthebox only offers to reimburse the cost of the lamp itself but at the end if I pay all shipment costs this is a major loss for me They are not taking the responsibility of their poor product quality and are making their customers loose money and time
I am still requesting them to pay for the shipping costs If they decide to take responsibility and pay for the consequences I will let you know uodating my review
Had to wait 20 min to be acknowledged in the store order completely wrong when delivered pieces missing items in back order that the store never told me wasnt coming supposed to get caught and wasnt on the order and now have to wait 24 more hours for a new box spring I am livid
Great price but poor customer service
I am a frequent flyer and Ive tried so many companies but never something like this happened to me They cancelled my flight to Iceland the 31st of December Meaning I was planning to spend the New Years Eve in Reykjavik but instead I had to book with another company and spend it somewhere in Germany waiting for my transit to Iceland
They only informed me about the cancellation 3 hours before the flight when I was already in the airport since I was with a transit The worst part the didnt offer any alternative No flight the same day or the next or anything They literally abandon us with no solution I was told after I can ask for compensation which they even dared to refuse When they literally treated us like sht Never again
I was charged 40 for a bunch of flowers that consisted of 8 flowers which half of them were dead or damaged a replacement bunch was sent out and that was worse that the first one A refund was refused Customer services are shocking I would NEVER use or recommend anyone using this company Disgusting
I ordered flowers and paid extra to have them delivered at weekend to France on Mothers day I received a message to say they had been delivered so was happy Rang Mum and asked if she was happy with the flowers only to be informed they had not arrived and have still not arrived as of today Tuesday I dont know whether to be upset or angry Quite unbelievable that I had a message saying they had been delivered when this is clearly not the caseMothers Day was ruined for both of us
This company decided it was a good idea to deliver a package and leave it on a public street on a busy road in central London as you can imagine it wasnt there in the morning
Once I complained and confirmed this one off free sample wouldnt be followed up with any future deliveries I was accused of Fraud and charged the cost of the free box
Just stick to Waitrose
I normally order from this company quite often during the Valentines Day season I called days prior to ensure the deliverance of the bouquets I received an email stating the day of the order had been cancelled by the sender When I inquired the representative stated it was a mistake But later in the day I received a call stating the item wouldnt be delivered as they ran out of teddy bears the day prior This was a big lack of communication honesty and organization on Cookie Bouquet I ordered two bouquets that day to be delivered to two different individuals Only one of the orders where delivered Due to the companys lack of communication and capability to fulfill the order they suggested to deliver the cookie bouquet on the 16th I refused as it defeated the purpose of Valentines Day And was fortunate enough to be refunded Will never order again
I did not receive a phone call to schedule the delivery within the 2 days from order placement in which they stated online I called customer service twice to discuss delivery in which they had scheduled but never let me know The first time I was instructed to call on Saturday because thats when they figure out delivery times I called Saturday and they said they dont figure out times until 7pm and that they would email me I never received an email They stated they would give me a 2hour time frame on delivery day I was called the morning of delivery with a time frame of 45 minutes Communication was very poor for this order I have had other instore experiences with RC Willey and they were great but this online experience was very poor
The car wasnt ready when arrived Had to wait 20 minutes Car wasnt cleaned We also didnt get the car we ordered
The check that was sent to me for the books I sent in was not cashable at my bank The ink on the check was flaking off and my bank was unable to process it I called and left two messages using the number on the check and no one has returned my call I have also tried to email this company Again No luck
This should not happen
Privacy breached
The spam has already started
They have not returned my money and its been months I sent all the paperwork they requested and still no refund Now they want the tracking number What a load of crap they are thieves DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS WEBSITE
We had ordered cake for our anniversary but did not receive it till today Have raised complaint to Ups service but no response till today Whole money 465 USD wasted Extremely bad experience as It was my first wedding anniversary I ordered from India for my husband who is in US but you just spoiled our precious moment like anything Appologise for the rude comments but what else can I say Dont ever do this again with any customer as it is not only about money Gift sometimes means more than that and are related with the emotions of humans Regards Kavita 91 9538882566
Not happy here We bought concert tickets but wont know seating until 2 days before vent Makes no sense to me I want to know where we are sitting not guess
At first the service I received was great There was an issue with my order due to an error on the website and they were quick to let me know and let me choose an alternate item that was more money than the original item without charging me a difference However when I wanted to return an item I received not one response after three emails sent Good service only comes when your spending money not when youre trying to get it back
I wanted to make a simple change to my itinerary and was told that I had to call Air Canada I dont know exactly whos fault this was but in any case I spend hours of my time on hold communicating to both these companies I will never book through Flight Hub again
The 2 stars are because it was easy to set up and use the service but the process to cancel has been terrible
I have been trying to cancel my subscription after I no longer needed the site and domain I received a reminder to cancel or renew on the 26th of Jan 2017 I then started to cancel my domain after checking with the person it was set up for but was told that I needed to have done so before the 25th of Jan As such I will now be charged for a full year and the cancellation will take place in 2018 I obviously disputed this but that was never acknowledged I just had to pay and suck it up My last message went unresponded to until the early hours of the 24th of Feb which just by chance is when they slapped me with a reminder fee that because I havent paid I would now have to pay 10 more SO despite an open ticket trying to cancel my subscription it was now going to cost me extra to cancel
I have reluctantly paid and canceled but continue to received payment reminders including via text Maybe link your systems together
It all comes across as very dodgy Send one reminder one day after the cut off and then with open tickets to cancel an account start adding reminder fees so I cant pursue the ticket further as if I dont pay itll just get more and more expensive
Send reminders BEFORE cut off and make it clear that you intend to add fees in those emails DONT hide them behind your terms and conditions wall Also read ticket messages and respond to the questionsstatements made by users rather than just copy and paste your scripted responses Not a very personal experience
Please dont book tickets on Travelopod For change of tickets they Quote d a hefty amount of 1007 for change of fee and 100 for Change of Ticket amount When I called British Airways directly all I could do with just 88 Customer Service people dont know how to check the prices properly and they tell different prices by different people Seriously it sucks big time
Added Travelopod Team I havent booked tickets with this Email ID Please dont attempt to remove ratings posted by customers posted
I purchased a replacement light after the first one went dead I bought the replacement bulb already in the supporting structure After plugging it in I noticed a bright spot at the bottom middle left of my screen I took the whole thing back apart and cleaned every surface but it still shows up No time to do returns which is why I bought a factory replacement more expensive than aftermarket in the first place 
I was informed last Thursday that my plane to Bangkok had been cancelled without any further explanation
I was offered the chance to either find an alternative flight or have my payment refunded Unfortunately I accepted to make bravoflycom attempt to find another flight for me Big mistake
Now its only a week until I was supposed to go on my holiday and I dont know whether I should try to find another ticket myself if I should wait for bravoflycom to help me or if I should simply give up and stay at home
It is not possible to contact bravoflycom by phone either although they will happily charge you for attempting to do that
Never ever use that web site It is basically a scamming site
Asked to sign up to new fibre broadband only to have constant issues with getting connected After cancelling supplier now have too call them back and get reconnected due to airs lack of customer care Contacted Adam a supervisor who refused to give his email for me to make a complaint
Unbelievable
I see the same jobs week after week and they do not put the date to know how long they have been there
Hi everyone I made 2 orders for helmets some 2 weeks ago Immediately I received a notification that my goods were in transit to their dispatch center Nothing has changed since then although the expected delivery date is still March 2427 I wrote several letters to them but they only answered once others are just being ignored Im starting to think that they have nothing of their showcase on stock and now theyre trying desperately to find some stale or discounted products with other sellers to ship to me I met such sellers before although they did not look so major and solid as this webstore does I will change my review for better if I finally receive my goods but until then I STRONGLY ADVICE YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS STORE if you dont want a headache like mine
I called to order 5 bouquets I picked 3 of same kind my close friend received one and sent me a photo which was nowhere like pictured on website The arrangement I chose was citrus smiles and the bouquet elicited was straggly poorly arranged  I could do a better job and did not contain as many roses as I picked online Rep who helped me was polite but it took an hour to order called to complain they are going to pick bouquet up and redeliver cancelled another order with them Take my advice take the picture go to your local florist and have them arrange it you will get a better deal
The canvas was on the wall for a couple months The canvas and backing came apart and the canvas fell off to the floor Not a little It cant be fixed and I expected a replacement What I got was a credit for the cost of the canvas Thats fine except I have to pay for shipping  handling This is their fault with shoddy workmanship and I have to pay I gave it a 2 because the actual photo on canvas came out awesome
The order I placed was shipped from China and Im still waiting for it Here is what the tracking looks like Today is March 28 2017 and I am still waiting

Dont shop at Ssence Overcharged sent wrong item had to pay for return No excuse no one apologiesed Horrible really
Ink cartridge printed only about 20 pages and low light is on again Pages were not full of print or pictures so the cartridge didnt seem to have much ink in it
Noticed my name was auto filled in the second passengers name instead of my daughters Immediately called customer service and they would not make the correction Instead cancelled the complete reservation and had to make a new one to get charged again At least after much discussion the waived the cancellation fee I was on the phone for 130 minutes Also they charged 30 for preseat collection automatically without even giving the seat numbersVery disappointing booking experience Worst site and experience ever
Nothing else to say apart from the title
Had my review for what I considered to be a fantastic service pre sale I have proof of purchase of which trustpilot havent even asked to see nor requested I amend my review at all My first review on this site and it has been taken down for a compliance issue or something like that To save a person the effort of typing reviews to them see it taken down and labelled as Archived it might be an idea to inform the reviewer as to howwhat exactly was the issue with the post
I had credit which I thought would have been repaid via paypal a while back as a proper refund Suddenly I need a plugin which is 1 more than my credit Can I pay the 1 Oh no Minimum deposit 20 which will expire and is not refundable How is there a handling charge for payments
This is very poor and I told the author that I will not purchase any more of his plugins through this company
It isnt the money it is the business model which is out to have you over at any available opportunity Maybe not yet thieves as the credit hasnt expired at this juncture but certainly rogues
Site looks good Heaps of interesting products Everything is in stock until you order then its delayed Not a problem Im patient
When goods arrive highend smartphone it looks great but it doesnt work or it works for a few minutes Ordered several times and each time the phone was DOA dead on arrival
Customer service responds fast and in a polite way Simply return the phone and well refund you And thats it They claim return parcels have not arrived they dont refund your money and they stop answering your emails Dont shop here Youll waste your money Go for a reliable shop in Europe or the USA and stay away from this shop
Update 2203 After Banggoods response The product has been returned to Banggood according to their shipping specs They promised a refund just as it says in their policy as posted by them But they never fulfilled that promise and theyre not replying to emails So Ill send a new one as requested by their repsons to this review
Sorry to say that but the shipping process is inefficient  my order is being submitted since 10 days  till now it didnt reach or give a notice that its shipped

Hi All
I am writing to confirm that I have just faced exactly the same experience with flizzr whereby I am being accused of damaging the car a scratch which I know did not exist when I returned the car
Having seen a similar incident posted on the website I thought it would be prudent to share my experience as it would appear to me that this organisation operations ought to be reviewed by external regulators immediately
I purchased two Dash Cams from Newfrog and after waiting three weeks for delivery they finally arrived from China most purchases from Newfrog come directly from China and were in New condition After discovering they were not exactly what I expected not Newfrogs fault I chose to return them and purchase a better more expensive model and told them such I sent multiple 5 emails  webpage return forms without any correspondence
I finally donated the items and then over one month later I received an email to start the return process Since the Dash Cams were already gone I had nothing to return Following this experience I will not purchase anything in the future from Newfrog Buyer beware
Following this experience I will not purchase anything in the future from Newfrog

Was given a delivery time and my order never arrived there were two people home at the time very disappointing
My experience with buying from Amazon Germany is that in the majority of attempted orders Amazon informs me that the supplier refuses to ship to Denmark Since both Denmark and Germany are members of the European Common Market and that Denmark lies right on Germanys northern border it is incomprehensible to me why the suppliers wont ship to Denmark
I have at times after being refused contacted the supplier directly and been able to purchase the item
Its understandable why a supplier wouldnt want to ship to certain 3rd world countries but shipping to anywhere within the Common Market shouldnt be denied
This complaint applies equally to Amazon UK as well
The product itself was great But when I ordered it the confirmation said go to the Orem store for pick up but when I got there they said it was in the Salt Lake store So I had to make another trip up to the Orem store once they finally received it in What a hassleI wish they had CHEAP shipping for smaller items
Didnt receive my last order I love the ssense website  all their gear One of my favorite sites actually but something happened with my order  it kind of threw me off Hopefully this never happens again
Have had 7 days so far of hell from this company have been constantly trying to sort out my dads flight due to a schedule change by the airline Each representative I speak to so far I think 7 have said they will pass my request for an alternative date to their specialist department urgently to get the date requested confirmed as the original alternative date offered was no good Have spoken to the airline who say no one has approached them from Lastminutecom to request the change and this is 7 days later I will never ever consider using this company again as mentioned if no changes then fine if any changes then they are useless absolutely would not recommend this company I dread to hear in the next 7 days if they can be bothered to get back to me Never had such a bad experience all I can say is stay away based on my experience I will see if I can get my solicitor involved as this has becomes the biggest farce which is not acceptable
I cancelled my policy during cooling off period There are 3 areas referencing cancellation on their website and I carefully read before sending I sent by post the disc certificate and the letter outlining reason for cancellation
Today I was told they cant cancel as my signature was typed  not handwritten So I then checked website no where did it say this so I then checked terms of business and there it states signed letter However it doesnt state original handwritten signature on their website in all 3 locations
Ive asked them to accept my initial letter but its just very frustrating Feel like Ive been conned right from the get go with this crowd
OptiContacts is legitimate and offers customer service that replies quickly to emails But the price of the contact lenses I bought from them was tricky meaning it was advertised as the lowest price out of all the results that showed up on googlecause they throw in a sneaky huge Processing Fee tacked on an the very end right before paying with your credit card Thankfully I saw the big Processing Fee and cancelled my order which they did I ended up buying with EZ Contacts for a lower overall price  and EZ Contacts did not have any processing fee at all
Las facturas son un desastres

Overall i only heard positive things about the intro vibrator However it broke the day after I received it and I had only used it once So pretty disappointed in it
was 15mins later than Quote d
We rented an automatic Subaru Forester from the Wellington office and 2 hours before returning it it overheated and the area beneath the engine caught on fire It was only when the fire brigade turned up that we found out there had been a lot of issues with Subaru Foresters overheating and that this was not the first one that had caught fire that week Apparently the office was aware of the issues with these cars and had been trying to get them recalled but rented one to us regardless As a result of this incident one of our party missed their flight and was 360 out of pocket a cost which the office did not cover
The woman in the office was really lovely and arranged a ride for us back to our accommodation after the incident and then a ride into the city after we were done at the office the next day and we had pleasant enough experiences with the Picton and Christchurch offices This however does not outweigh the fact that through Omegas thoughtlessness our lives were put at risk due to a faulty car We will not be renting from Omega again
Online booking process nice and simple but unfortunately dropping my parcel off was a little more challenging My local Pack and Send Centre knocked off early on the Friday I went down there and then decided not to open on the Saturday either even after I had confirmed the hours with customer service There is only a messaging service or online chat assistant available on the weekend both of which were unable to help My consignment had to be re booked for pick up on the Wednesday and then did not reach the customer until the following Monday Estimate was 12 days Not a great first experience
Didnt like it at all
after purchasing the xbox one gift card and typing in the code I still could not access xbox live

As seems to be common I was charged with an unexpected customs penalty on my order Not only that though they split my order into two deliveries due to items being on back order so I had to pay the customs charge twice totalling 2248 on an order that had cost me 2207 originally Therefore doubling the cost I called customer services 4 working days ago who said I would receive a refund by the end of the day but Im yet to receive anything

It keeps blocking my iPhone address and wont fix it this s i tell sucks
The reason for the punctuation is due to the fact that the support they have is very bad A few weeks ago I wanted to buy the PAX 3 I first tried on the main page at Pax Labs I had problems with the payment and decided to try on this Vape World I tried the first time I was sent a message of the number of the order and 3 days later they send me a message saying that the payment was fraudulent and that I had to enter a new card to be able to make the purchase I went to my bank to solve the problem it turned out that my card did not have any problem I tried to buy the PAX again they sent me the confirmation message of the purchase but my card had not charged anything Then I understood that nothing was right I tried again a third time with a new card and I have the same problem I contacted the customer service
wishing to know how the package was going in case the purchase had been given they answered me but they did not solve anything they left my case unfinished Maybe somebody will help me around here
I was disappointed in every aspect From the lack of being able to schedule the delivery time and date to the condition of the product which was not in perfect condition as hopedI also did not realize that this item needed assembly This left me with a bad feeling and knowing that the product was marred and if I wanted it exchanged dealing with the process was not worth it
I paid 35 pounds for a measly handful of average flowers I could have picked up some nicer ones for a tenner at Tesco Dont waste your money Its a good job Im taking my mother out for dinner tonight as she would have been very disappointed

1st I want to make clear I purchased a ton of new furniture from American Freight since Nov last yr Some items were available in stock immediately and no issues However upon ordering furniture not in stock was the worse decision we ever made

Purchased beautiful table Was given wrong one and had to exchange it in box

15 days ago I used the company to send money from BRL to GBP after paying the invoice it took me 5 days with no confirmation email I received an message saying that on a Saturday the money was credit into the account in the UK
Therefore no money was in the account
After several contact with TransferWise all they did was to send me to the bank ask why the money was not there After listening to the manager says the same answer during 3 visits to the bank transfer wise insist to say that is MY PROBLEM and that there is NOTHING they can do That I  the costumer the person who paid a high fee for their services who paid the invoice to their company should be dealing with the bank coz they said they have paid and the bank says the money never reach their institution
THIS IS THE SITUATION IM IN TODAY
Transferwise blames the bank and the bank claim to never received the money and I lost my money so far
We showed the bank account statement to proof that the money never reached our account signed by the manager
All TransferWise says is that they did the transfer they have a identification number for the transfer  that the bank dont recognise and that I should solve this with the bank
Today is my last attempt to try to call them and try to solve this before going to the authorities and report the felony they are doing with their costumer

Transcats turn around time has been getting poorer and poorer over the years Even when we pay for expedition the turn around time is still high as compared with other similar vendors The communication is also poor as it seems everyone that I talk to is unaware of the status or gives inaccurate updates

90 of the candy is stuff you can get at most stores or candy stores and pay way less I tried to cancel the order and the girl told me they added new stuff When you go to pick the candy each month they only give about 1015 to choose from and dont send chocolate to certain states 2nd time I tried to cancel I was successful but the customer service representative was really rude She sounded like she was upset about canceling the order and had a condescending tone Even if I changed my mind and wanted to renew my subscription I wont based on the bad customer service

The worst service we had booked and our service included the meet and greet at the airport we had to wait for over 30 minutes for someone to help us with the car when we got it they blocked 28000 pesos as a deposit in the reservation didnt say that it was gonna be this amount
The people working there was extremly rude and they gave us a crashed car That is not the service that we hired

This company gives customers unsolicited phone calls to get feedback which is unacceptable in my opinion They should ask before they do that Email is okay phone calls are not
Awful company with terrible customer services No one seems to know what is going on and they dont call you back when they say they will
My car had been booked in for 4weeks for a full service On the day my car was due for it service I had to ring service stop which took me 20 minutes to get through to an agent at 950am to find out why my car hadnt been collected between 89am as they had agreed when I booked my service
I was told by the agent I spoke to they couldnt get hold of the garage that my car was booked in with so their senior advisor would give me a call back when they got through to garage on their mobile
Approximately 20 minutes later I received a call back from service stop to inform me they had got hold of the garage  someone was on there way to collect my vehicle  they would be with me shortly  they said the garage apologised as they forgot to call me I accepted this and said that was fine if someone was on there way
I waited another 2 hours  my car still hadnt been collected So I called service stop again at 1150 to be put on hold  then be informed that my car wasnt going to be collected or serviced today as there had been a mix up I told them this was unacceptable and wanted to speak to a manager
I was then placed on hold for a further 10minutes to be told manager was unavailable I told agent I would wait I was placed on hold for a further 15 minutes  I was finally put through to a manager who could give anu reason or explanation to why my car hadnt been collected
The manager told me she could offer me 10 of if I rebooked even tho I had to take a day of work as service stop failed to have my car collected at the agreed time  they lied to me  said someone was on there Way even tho this was not case
After reading all the reviews online and my bad experience I would not recommend service stop Ltd to friends family or colleagues
I will be sticking to local garages from now on
Your service is rude and intrusive  I will not tolerate penis shaped SEX toys delivered to my Email nor within your advertisement in the feed you obtrusively place when I open my phone
I will spread the word that your bottom line is generated by sliming your potential customers

I ordered my supplements 6 days ago and yet to have a tracking number on where my order is I give this rating due to the fact of the poor communication with the customer The building I live in is very hard to get into and so having a tracking number is very important If I miss the delivery than I have to go out of my way just to go pick the package up
The frame is very flimsy Not worth the price
I tried to order balloons for my nieces birthday I placed the order at noon for delivery the same day and was told it would be delivered by 4 pm Two hours later they called to say the delivery would not happen until the next day When I said I wanted to cancel the order they told me I had to speak with a manager to do that and put me on hold The call was never picked up I hung up and tried again  I had to explain again the reason for my call and was put on hold again for a manager and the call again was never picked up I called a third time and finally spoke with someone who cancelled the order By this time it was too late for me to get someone else to deliver that day I will never call them again

Wanting same day delivery I placed an order early one morning Their fine print commitment to service and guarantee of satisfaction seemed very good Late that night the web site showed rescheduled for delivery The next day recipient texted me Delivery had been the previous day Flowers old and haggard The picture absolutely little like the deluxe order I had placed Customer service was a joke I sent pictures and everything expressing my disappointment No satisfaction although initially a 10 credit on next order was offered Other than that they never got back Definitely stay away Will never use again Big mistake
I purchased a Hustler cb antenna after reading the reviews thinking it would be a good deal The same day it was installed it broke because of it was a cheap and flimsy antenna CB World will ONLY allow positive reviews to be posted I had send 2 negative reviews and they were never posted Now I am out 4939 for a antenna I cannot use I contacted Hustles antenna to tell them of the problem and they told me I would have to buy the partno problem BUT the price of the 1 part was 2000 Now the part is 1 of the smallest parts on the antenna the only parts smaller is the set screw and the sleeve the part is about 34x14 CB World knows of the problem and never got back to me in any way It shows me they dont care about the customer at all I will never buy from CB World again
After reading their reply I still stand by my reviews If the antenna had been stronger the base would have never broke
Made a reservation came to the office to pick up my keys and was told that my booking was cancelled by me which is not true Personnel couldnt help to resolve the problem All plans crashed Never book a car with them again Dont repeat my mistake pay a bit more at cicar or cabreramedina and get a great car without any hassle and troubles

The dealership was good Just the customer service department that sucks Near to bald tires on vehicle when purchased Was told to call customer service to make an appointment to have tires put on Was told by customer service that the warranty didnt cover them Paid double for the vehicle and couldnt get tires put on
This company is dishonest and will not listen to customers I have been trying to get my money back and they refuse based on dishonest advertising Here is what they did to me
My future wife purchased some wedding stuff on Feb 26th I should have known right then and there this company was crooked when the bank shut her CC off due to security reports Since she could not pay for the items I used my CC and purchased the items We purchase all the items because they said on the site 58 days delivery
Well that was a lie it took weeks just to process before shipping On march 10th 7 whole days before they said it would be ready to ship I started looking at rip off websites and reading horror stories about this company They have been ripping people off for years
So fearing for my purchase and running out to time to buy a wedding dress and stuff I cancelled the order they told me in a ticket system because there is no one to call or speak to about anything that I would have to pay 50 return fees because the dress was custom made and had already been made
Days went by and the tickets came back saying we are still shipping even though I specifically asked for my order to be cancelled
LightInTheBox Customer Service
March 10 2017 0523 AM From charles smith
I have cancelled this order due to the fact that you advertise you ship in 58 days  but neglect to let consumers know that processing is 2 weeks as well
It is kind of disheartening that you do not actually let consumers know the actual time frame it takes This is kind of bait and switch tactics PLease let me know when my refund has been processed
Charles
They gave me the run around and shipped the package anyways DHL So I called DHL and refused the package Their response to my refund is that they shipped it so no refund
This is a very crooked shady dishonest company that runs out of China and has no real ties to the USA so stay away dont buy anything Dont be a Victim
Charles

Cartridges did not work in our printer After several attempts by you sending us different cartridges Our printer had come up with a reading that our printer kept telling my husband we had the wrong ink head in the printer We tried several times resolving it several times with your customer service dept They were very helpful in trying to resolve the problem and finally refunded our money But as a result of using this ink and everything we tried our printer no longer works Not sure what went long
Its been a week since I sent email and Ive never heard back
Quality of the

Problems with scheduling due to the companies limited availability or unresponsive One was a no show twice and groupon expiredno refund I still have to pay the full price of lose my group price No followup after Groupon contacted the company who said THEY would contact us in 35 daysNOTHING Do I want this company working on my car Another advertised groupon was a 55 discount only to fine out that the REGULAR price was LESS than the groupon price I complained twice and found they actually had the gall to raise the groupon price AFTER I complained Only refunded one of the two I purchased
I placed an order in November goods arrived in December and i notified them straight away i wanted to return them as one item was 2nd hand and the others were not good quality It took a few emails and about a month to get a response from Milan Direct They finally agreed to return the goods I took a day off work to wait for courier to pick up who didnt show Over a wk later the goods have still not been picked up and my refund is refused MD has some of the worst customer service i have ever experienced
Item from Siebon Carbon took 4 months to receive and arrived defective
Siebon and Carid refuse to stand behind their products Parts can not be used and there is still no resolution nor help The customer is their enemy
I have been a member for about a year and half with a relatively pleasurable experience Starting about January 2017 the technical problems have been very frustrating It started with my tree would no longer sync with Family Tree Maker 2014 After downloading and uploading new trees to get the sync working again I lost all of my attached media and photos In February again my trees would not sync repeat loss of documentation and photos For about a month when I try to add something to my tree I keep getting a message Some features are not available at this time please try again later we are working on the problem A lot of time is wasted repeating this process 4 to 5 times to add something to my tree I understand an occasional technical problem but if your computer techs can not resolve it within a month you should look into replacing them with those who can Before your customers replace Ancestry with MyHeritage My understanding and patients has worn thin I assume you will resolve these technical problems before my membership renewal is due on April 13th if not I am switching
Thank you bftaulbee1
The shipping charge on my order is as much as my order I was never informed when my shipping was going to be shipped which I had to call to find out after a couple months of placing the order Needless to say customer service is not a pleasant experience
Bad experience The item doesnt fit to the motorcycle as description Now i have the item in Brazil but they paid the return just from USA So i have nothing to do just assume the lose of money
inconvenience site
Wont use again  I was sent toner that wont even work in my printer  Have to go and buy the genuine product now
I was charged for a chipped windscreen that I know was chipped when I picked up the car
I just switched to DISH and LOVE some of the features ie Prime Time any time and great music channels HOWEVER Ive had the service for five days now and I cant set up favorites lists Ive called twice and have been told it will be looked into we havent had other similar complaints Now this is a deal breaker for me because I dont want to scroll through over 200 channels every time I watch TV So perhaps whenif this issue is resolved Ill change this to five stars
Saved for years to take my son to Orlando and booked with lastminutecom Supposed to be leaving in 4 days I emaild the hotel yesterday about something minor only to be told that There is a problem with my booking but that they cant tell me what because I didnt book it direct with them Called lastminutecom and they said they dont see a problem but they would look into it and get back to me
As you can imagine having saved for years and spent thousand of pounds now with the prospect of landing in Orlando at midnight with a small child and without a hotel to go to I am incredibly stressed wondering if our holiday will be ruined I suspect my lasting memory of this holiday will be the panic and worry the week before and thats assuming we even get to go Ill update this review with what happens
Long story short  booked flights with Bravofly KLM  couldnt travel due to childrens severe illness  provided medical documents  Bravofly most likely did not forward them to KLM did not ask for full refund  told me that KLM did not pay refund  even took 20 handling fee from the tax refund
BEWARE
And following Bravoflys response below I digged further and the information I gathered from the airlines show how Bravofly keep its customers uninformedmisinformed Following is the response from KLM when asked if they actually have a policy of norefund for sickness I was never given the rebooking option
When booking your ticket through KLM our policy is to rebook passengers to another date in case of illness In that case you wont have to pay a penalty fee to change the ticket Since you booked through a travel agent the travel agent is responsible for your booking so we cant help you with this since the guidelines of your travel agency apply and we are not allowed to help you with this
If you want to be charged without your consent you should choose Godaddy
If you only want phone support in another language Godaddy is also you goto provider
If you want to be spammed with offers on webdesign and SEO when you register a new domain you should definitely choose Godaddy
Was charged for 2 domains automaticly by creditcard 14 days before renewal and godaddy refuse to refund me They charge double price for DK domains
2nd day I was disappointed
Only DHL express for shipments to DE other China Supplier offer also free shipping even its longer time
parts missing I got a incomplete quick disconnect kit I feel that I should get all the parts I paid for and not have to call and recall to get the missing parts replaced and sent after all paying all most 50000 for bags and disconnect mounting kit then I sent an email asking about discounts as I bought the bags and disconnect kit on presidents day and got no response maybe after I get all the parts and mount the bags my review might be different
I have written a review on yelp
look it up and read it
I will never do business with Ticket City and I will always warn people about your tactics resembling Fruadulent and Con Artist actions
Give me a break  return my money immediately and I will remove the Honest Yelp Truthfull Comments
I have opened a dispute with my bank to remove your fees and the charges for tickets I never received Lets go to Court Id love to share my story with the media
The employees that I had contract with where horrible Ive never ever experienced customer service like this especially with Julius He was so rude so aggressive I told him a couple of times to not speak to me in that tone Dont dont dont he told me one price and then once the service started it ended up being so much more Lies lies
I bought products that I never had because Fedex Customs Department blocked them I had to pay more than  100 in respect of import and this information was not provided at the time of purchase I asked for the refund but a week later still not made
I went to send flowers and chocolates to my girlfriend in Madrid for Valentines Day and have been doing this years since we travel a lot and dont usually get to spend it together This year I was disappointed to find half of my order didnt show up and later to find out that floraqueen would not provided a sufficient refund
I was told they would only provide a minimal amount of credit or a small percentage off towards my next purchase at best Which in turn is useless since i have no intention of using the service again if they cannot provide what was promised or make up for the error in an adiquate way I understand mistakes happen but without fair compensation since this service is expensive there is no security for the consumer in using this service when this happens
Therefore I was disappointed and would not recommend this service
Veryvery long story which I will make as brief as possible Took on Europcar courtesy car for 2 and half days Handed back and within a week received a letter from Europcar alleging 550 plus worth of damage
As a first time hirer of car  husband normally deals I did not thoroughly check vehicle beforehand  I actually trusted Europcar silly silly me
Over several months I tried to fight it  even went to Ombudsmen BVRLA but Europcar are very careful with paperwork you cannot fight their claims They are thoroughly dishonest and just want to rip people off
Do not accept car until you have thoroughly checked and only hand bank with Europcar agent present  I left with Hyundai who had arranged car  left in garage for hours but Im still responsible for it
I want my money back only this
Before you try any other travel or flight websites You should definitely check Flight Hub first Out of all the websites that I viewed they really honestly have the cheapest rate you need to check all your go to websites and compare ticket prices first before you book any tickets Im postive you will not find a cheaper rate I compare their rate for 372 to all the rest of sites and the same ticket was over 600
coupons are a gimmick they never work
This company is the worst Sends wrong item no return no adjustment to price no help It is not worth any amount of savings to go with this company
the cartridge no good and when we took back out of puter they broke apart not happy at all
it was the first time and the last i will use Telaflora I placed my order for my step daughter to get her flowers on 21417 I contact the local florist after spending 2 days trying to get a hold of someone at Teleflora the flowers were not delivered because the local florist said they need more MONEY from Teleflora  My step daughter lost her mom so it was VERY important that she got those flowers I was disappointed
Here in Brazil when you access the site you have the change from dollars to real exchange this way you can not complete the purchase your card is refused
I bought a Fendi backpack but the item was faulty when I recieved it Ssense cant exchange me a good one as all they have in stock are with the same fault I say faulty because the fault was proved by the staff in my local Fendi boutique and they told me the backpacks with this problem were supposed to be sent back to Fendi headoffice
I have just received my third bill from you and it has doubled since my last Apparently my last bill was underestimated so now I have to deal with having an extra high bill to pay at a weeks notice instead of having a correct bill last time and this time I will be happily paying the 50e cancellation fee and taking my business elsewhere
At first they charged me Bergamo airport for so called flex fuel option that mean that you take fully tank car but they charged you for fully tank car I didnt know that they will charged me  there was no information about an extra payments at the rental desk They claim to this situation then that I should read very carefully whole contract I did it  more than 10 years Im renting cars So in the beginning I paid twice more than reservation The car has been with scratches and no marks from their side about that then they had charged me for existing scratch at the drop off but only next day I had returned the car  there is nobody in the evening to check the cars at parking My option was without insurance therefore they was waiting for any possibility to charge me for anything In my experience Im renting cars without insurance and over years I havent got any problems like with Goldcar at Bergamo Moreover there is unreliable customer service by email Avoid this car rental company as a fire
I will never deal with your organisation again and will tell all my friends and family
Unimpressed with a 4 week turnaround for custom seat covers and dashmat given that website Quote s 12 weeks Further problems in that the dashmat was lost in courier transit somehow according to Motoquipe and took another 9 days to remake and deliver So almost 6 weeks from start to final delivery of order
Car seat covers look good and have no issues other than turnaround time
BUT the custom dashmat is just a dashmat mass produced for a different model vehicle that has an extra piece of matching fabric loosely tacked over an area that would leave an exposed hole in our model car A couple of stiches on either side barely holds it in place and everyone who gets into my car tugs on it thinking it is an intended flap that opens Mostly it looks like a dodgy home job Not what I expected
Edit in reply to responseI think you will find that actullay Shevron are the only brand who take a Dodge model Dashmat and loosely stitch extra fabric over a nonconforming spot Not quite the same thing as custom and there was definitely no indication of that in the description or photos Having an uncommon car doesnt mean I have to be grateful for deceptive or poor products or services Nor do I expect a company to disclose personal information about me in a reply to a review they do not like
Advertised for free shipping if my order was over 50 I was under the free shipping by 050 cents so I went back and chose an item to bring it to 50 dollars I entered one promo code that was offered on the website however I could not enter the second promo code for the free shipping for items over 50 Ended up paying 18 for shipping when it was advertised to be free 
I dont usually write reviews but I have to make an exception I was selling my phone to music magpie At first it was smooth setting up account and sending phone over
They recieved item said it was damaged abd i declined the offer
Now the problems begin They basically said they would return my item Ok so i wait and waitno replyi contact them on twitter and email with responses ranging from 2 days to 5 days
They have said they are chasing royal mail and it has been over a month and i habe still kt recieved an outcome
Be warned they take ages to reply to emails or twitteri will not use them again and not recommend to friends or family
I cant get a person on the phone using the number that is required by law to be listed along with the charge as they hit my account for yet another 1095 fee For the last 3 months I have placed no less than one call each month giving all my information and my desire to stop all business with this company My last call as a matter of fact was placed just 2 days ago on Feb 17 2017 yet today on Feb 19 2017 they made yet another charge to my account I have also noticed all charges to my account are made on a Sunday when I cant make any phone calls about this matter or so I thought Now that we are 4 months into this I have discovered that the number given for customer service is nothing but a dead line where you will talk to a recording without one call email to respond back to my requests I am 4 months in with no way to shut this down but to report them to my bank as a illegal charge on my card They will steal your money once you give them your card number for what you may think is a one time fee they will take as much money from you as they can making it very hard for you to contact then to tell them to stop
I have booked cars in Malaga for many years  always using Malagacar
Therefore I was pleased when they introduced their loyaltyprogram
It hasnt worked like a charm at any time  many emails back and forth But now I booked a car today  and afterwards emailed the company to ask them to apply my loyaltydiscount This is normal
What is not normal is that the member of staff now tells me that the loaltydiscount only apply to the basic rate  the cheapest
This means practically that i  having booked a fullpack receives no discount at all  maybe 6 euros in a booking of 260 euros
This is bad business I asked the member of staff to send me a link in which this rule of only basic loyaltydiscount  and he refuses to do so Nowhere om Malagacars website does it say that the discount only is for the cheapest rate  therefore close to nothing
I have cancelled my booking and taken my business elsewhere
This is a shame  I have had no problems for many years

I purchased a voucher on line for a leisure break The voucher clearly says to contact the hotel for reservation Hotel will not honour as they say i have to book with last minute Called last minute about 10 times once being connected to India for 35 minutes and they say the voucher number doesnt exist on their system Pure fraudsters and I have wasted 99
Not happy at all IAM LIVID
Sold an item on eBay was made to wait 5 days before the money was released and when I finally withdrew the funds I was told it would take another 3 to 4 working days to process Rang customer service and they are insanely useless claiming they have no power to do anything about releasing funds early All this happened as I am a verified customer with all bank details and credit cards verified
Only use PayPal if you are desperate is all I can say they torture their customers and I think they really need to keep up with the times as their ethos is take and give very little back
Its a shame But it was faulty from day one Everything else as been good So will use again
While I felt I purchased tickets to the pixies concert for a reasonable price the mark up from the reseller was 30 extra I feel the current scalying going on in the J Cole reselling is horrific A cap needs to be put in place to stop mark ups of 600 on the original ticket price I ferl no more than 50 or even less would be fantastic
Aweful experience  Booked a trip on Friday paid 400 Deposit called Sunday to change the date move it back a week because of a previous commitment Was told I could not change the date because the airline already had the deposit But if I purchased ins For 150  Per person I could be refunded 100 2nd option was to pay 109 Per person and I could get 182 Towards a the new date  However if I went the previous week my price would increase by 400 For the same package I call the airline to verify that they had the deposit They told me they only take 10 Per person to reserve the flight I tried to speak to other people from blue sun vacations and none would budge or be helpful at all  Bad business practices Never deal with them
The book was advertised as very good It is in terrible condition Back to Amazon
Stayed over an hour on the phone trying to reach customer service to change my wifes booking 5 minutes after I made it No success This companys automated phone service is so archaic When I finally reached someone later on in the evening I was still made to wait on the line some 20 minutes Change was not free of course I was charged an extra fee and wasted more than 2 hours on top of that Very frustrating

This company not only provided me with a wrong referrence code for the online check in of Serbian Airlines but also refused to help me further The only good thing Ive seen from that company was the 50 euro out of 175eu which they send back to me In general never book with this company it takes them days to answer emails furthermore the answers will confuse and mislead you
I sent in my books and never got the money for it
Definitely a scam
It was very BadYou guys typed in the WRONG Zip Code and it took two weeks for it to get to the Post Office that corrected your error
The packaging was so bad that the Worker at the Post Office asked if I wanted to send it backIt was the worse package Ive ever gotten from a Business that I paid for
Im sorry to send you Bad news but I doubt I will prder anything else fro you guys I wished it would have been better service but you guys dropped the ball on this one
Sorry

Lens power is different had good experience in my previous purchases but this time Im not at all happy with the lens power
Ive used Event Tyres in the past and have always been very impressed with the service so I naturally went to them again when we needed a new tyre for my wifes mini cooper
I booked the date Wednesday and the fitter kept in touch with me throughout the day to keep me posted on his ETA He duly arrived as scheduled only to discover that hed been issued with a standard Pirelli instead of the runflat tyre which had been ordered
As it was nearly the end of the day I was advised that the correct tyre would be ordered and fitting rearranged for the following day Thursday I called the Event Tyres office the following morning to find out when fitter would arrive
I was told it was being coordinated by their Southern Office and that someone would call me to give me an update Suffice to say no one did so I chased the Central Office again later in the day and was told the tyre would be fitted on the following day Friday
By mid afternoon on Friday Id heard nothing from Event Tyres so I rang again to ask about a likely fitting time It was only then that I was told there was a stock issue with the particular tyre needed for our car
Consequently they wouldnt be able to locate and fit the tyre that day and instead it would be Monday of the following week before the tyre could be obtained by their supplier and then fitted to the car
This did eventually happen and again the fitter was excellent  he kept me informed of his schedule throughout the day arrived on time and completed the job in just a few minutes
My issue on this occasion is twofold Firstly there seemed to be an appalling lack of communication  coordination between Event Tyres central  southern offices
Secondly there seemed to be an unwillingness or inability by anyone at the central office to take responsibility for the problem find a sensible solution and communicate clearly with the customer
Instead they simply palmed off the problem to the Southern Office who never called me throughout the whole debacle and they seemed constantly surprised when I kept having to chase them for some kind of an update
I was told they have a new system in place but Id suggest it either needs some serious attention or they should revert back to the old system because as things stand the communication  coordination internally and with the customer is poor to say the least
they are just about the money dont care about the customer
Purchased hiking boots mid feb 2017 march 10th now and i have no idea where they are Tracking info doesnt show anything after package leaves spainreached out 4 times to customer service with no return communication Originally tried to cancel order before it shippedbut there is no way to get in touch with anyonejust automated emails from Silvia No chat available no option to inquire about order number xxxx If i could rate a zero i would Just terrible
I couldnt login in to Driver Support using proper login credentials I tried repeatedly to contact customer support by email and phone without success After numerous attempts to contact them without success I eventually sent a certified letter to Driver Support HQ cancelling service I have yet to receive any acknowledgement or return email from anyone at Driver Support No customer service  zero customer satisfaction
Our flight was cancelled coming home from Marrakesh the night before we were due to fly and lastminutecom were absolutely no help and absolutely no duty of care even though we had booked an all inclusive holiday including flights with them
They said we could fly back on the next flight available which was 3 days later then when we were supposed to fly back let alone we had to be back at work but to add insult to injury we would have to pay again for the hotel etc They even tried to sell us flights if we wanted to come back to the UK on the day we were supposed too Terrible customer service they were more concerned with selling us an indirect flight back to the UK not even our airport for 250 each rather then get us home
A complaint is in but now they are saying because we flew to a another country using our cancelled ticket so we could try and get ourselves home which we did via another 2 flights that we are not entitled to compensation an absolute joke and ruined the whole holiday
I booked my flight to Australia via Travelgenio As I wanted to add an extra baggage to my booking things got complicated I received an email from a staff membera woman called Veronicaoffering me two options for my additional service I replied immediately feeling confident that my request is being handled But I was wrongunfortunately I didnt received any answers for a week and had to call the company twice to get a reply from them that my request is being handled Now6 days prior my departure I still have no clue if I can bring my extra baggage or not Of course I send another email but as ussualthere was no reply I will probably have to call the company again although they normally put you on hold for 10min or moreand then if youre luckysomeone answers
I have no idea how my flight will bebut this is the last time I booked my flight via Travelgenio
I have never experienced such ignorance from a flight agency in my life
This company is nothing but a scam I have had this device for 7 months and Ive been locked out 1520 times The company said if there is a BCA they charge you 88 dollars per lockout My current bill is 8900 dollars and 700 of it is all lockouts They say there is over a thousand different ways you can get locked out Dont even bother with this joke of a company
I ordered mugs for 8 with pictures on
When I was going to make my order the shipping cost were 13 on top
Thats fooling
Firstly I would just like to say that the wrist brace I ordered is absolutely fantastic and I have no problems with it whatsoever but the delivery from Hermes was absolutely dreadful they lied and said they made three delivery attempts which all ended up going to the wrong house It took over a week and for me to phone physio room for them to contact Hermes and tell them that theyve been delivering to the wrong house
PS Almost a week on and Im still wearing the wrist brace and its doing an absolutely fantastic job with my injury
Still havent received it in almost 2 weeks
You will be lured by lower cost MOT and Service advertisements Once your car is taken for MOTService they will ask for unprecedented amount of money showing different faults They will phone you and give you the price and you reluctantly agree to pay it just to avoid another hassle of taking the car elsewhere again To your horror you will get the final bill by email much more higher than the agreed amount  you phone them to complain but they will threaten you and tell you that your car will not be released unless you pay the amount they have billed for This happened to me recently  I had never ever felt so let down and cheated before
As stated above I consider Trustpilot to be pointless and irritating from a consumer point of view I have never sought to find out a retailers Trustpilot rating before considering a purchase and actually resent the fact that I am presumably being asked to commit my time and opinion so that your company can profit from compiling this data Id rather not
Unfortunately after 2 hours at Madrid airport I was unable to continue with this booking because of the very unclear and misleading booking system you have So I had to leave the airport in a taxi 2 hours late and with no car now for my 2 days in Madrid having to spend over 150 in taxis
When booking the car I was asked for my details for payment and separately details for the main driver not me it also asked if I wanted to take out the full insurance pack to avoid any excess charges if the car were to be damaged in any way which I did On a previous trip I have been told this is a must because operators find any way they can to use the excess  on this case 950
However when I got to the car rental desk to pick up the car I was told that I couldnt have the car as my details were not the same as the main driver Despite it being me who paid for the booking Nowhere whilst booking did it say this had to be the case Only that the main driver needed to have their passport driving licence and a credit card all in their name Which we did If it does say this then it is not very clear at All or very misleading However the further excess charge despite being paid for already had to paid for by the main driver even though that isnt the person who paid for the booking Again this was never made clear when booking and is very misleading
As we didnt have funds on the main driver credit card to pay the additional 950 I was told I would have to change the booking over to my name and then pay a further 16 for the other person to go on as a second driver Now 2 hours later I am tired and extremely angry I asked to talk to a manager at the company who was based in Poland who was extremely unhelpful as were the local car hire company firefly I can now see why their customer rating is so low I was told that the additional insurance taken for the excess cover would be refunded but the daily charge for car would not I asked her to send me an email stating this as I would take it further when I returned to England To this day I have also received no email A week later after writing my complaint I have still heard nothing from the company
The whole service from landing in Spain is appalling Why would I pay for extra insurance to avoid further costs if I then have to take out a further one from the hire company or indeed wait up to 4 weeks to receive any refund if at all if it be taken The whole point of this extra insurance is to avoid any further costs whether they are temporary or not
Erg slecht contact
Delay in service slow response constant change of contacts badly designed sites
I ordered a bouquet of roses for my parents on Valentines Day on 1022017 the order was processed and approved On 1422017 I receive an email at 1754hours from the customer service that their local agents are not able to deliver the flowers to my parents
I am not sure how my order can be approved and charged to my bank account if the local agents could not deliver to my parents adress What is the procedure that is involved
This is totally irresponsible of them They could have informed me earlier and I would have ordered from another company so that the flowers could be delivered to my parents But no they had to wait until Valentines Day to tell me at 6pm via email Like I left my contact number for emergencies like this for Gods sake No surprise rose bouquet for my parents but just a terrible surprise for me
Bought a new Dell computer Dust all over it and obvious sitting somewhere for a while The system crashed Tried calling your office on numerous occasions but no one answered or bother to ring back

PAYPAL is one of the worst companies in the world to do business with
They are just plain cold and heartless
Without going into specific details
I am the VICTIM OF IDENTITY THEFT
I had my idenity stolen over 20 years ago by a family member who used that information to open various accounts in my nameto purchase all types of merchandise and even pornographic materials
He hacked into our home cable system and my computer to and used my personal information to order these materials WHILE I WAS AT WORK DOCUMENTED
As a result In 2006 PAYPAL restricted my account for violating their acceptable use policy with ABSOLUTELY EXPLANATION OR DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED
Now this creates a problem for me as I buy and sell on Ebay and use PayPal as my method of transferring and receiving money
Fast forward about 5 yearsI opened another PayPal account with a new email address
I use this account for HUNDREDS of transactions with ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEMS
ALL of a suddenwithout noticePayPal restricts this account as wellagainwith NO DOCUMENTATION OR EXPLANATION
I opened a THIRD ACCOUNTand after 2 weeksthe same thingits restricted
I contact PayPal dozens of times by email and phoneand all I get is APPEAL DENIED FORM emails back
I even send them documentation of my identity theft issue from the FTC and the Connecticut State PolicestillAPPEAL DENIED
Finally I contacted a private attorney and he advised me that PayPal is a state andor federally regulated financial institution and BY LAWI am entitled to a copy of detailed documentation of ALL financial transactions conducted in my name
SoI send PayPal a letter by certified mail requesting this information
They received it and signed for it on January 30thand it is now March 8thand no responseexcept for another 4th or 5th appealed denied email signed by Paul
So today I sent another request letter by certified mailwell just have to see IF andor WHEN they respond back to me
In closing it sucks that I have been a victim of identity theft to begin withand it has been an absolute NIGHTMARE for 20 years nowbut its even WORSE to be VICTIMIZED all over again by a company that doesnt give a damn about their customers that patronize them
I think it is EXTREMELY ANNOYING CHILDISH AND UNPROFESSIONAL that a company would not respond to REPEATED requests for information to help me clear my name
I also makes me wonder about their CREDIBILITY AND WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO HIDE
It also angers me that a company would rather battle it out in court than to resolve a real simple issue
I know that big companies like PayPal dont care about us small guys and that if they ignore me me or complicate the process that I will just give up and go away
WELLPayPal doesnt know me very wellbecause the more they play their corporate gamesthe harder I will fight for the answers I need
I would ask each and every person that reads this review to consider your business relationship with PayPalNOW or in the future
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO SUPPORT AND DO BUSINESS WITH A COMPANY THAT CARES ONLY ABOUT THEIR BOTTOM LINEAND NOT CONSUMERS

I bought 3 tickets for my husband and his 2 brothers to go to Malaysia since their father passed away It wasnt a vacation trip at all I needed to change their returning date since the process and all the paperworks were done quicker than we thought So they would like to come back early I called flighthub and talk to the agent to change my reservation on March 27 at 1030 am I spent about 2 hours to arrange these changes The agent told me that I would get the confirmation email about the changes within 24 hrs I even called them back around 6 pm to ask them my confirmation email and the agent said it will take about 24 hrs Then I received a forward email from my husband that he got email from flighthubcom regarding an immediate attention required The email was sent at 1147 am to him Malaysia time so its 1147 pm Toronto time I opened the email at 515 am I called flighthub rightaway I spent more than 2 hours to settle the issue Apparently the ticketing department didnt put my request when I called them yesterday and now they have to reprice the airline ticket and I ended up to pay more The supervisor wasnt helpful either She refused to talk to me until I insisted to talk to her How is it my fault that they didnt process my request and now they reprice the airline tickets This is absolutely a very unprofessional work that they have done They did wrong at their end but we have to pay for their mistake I am not going to buy ticket from this website anymore nor I will recommend this agent to my friends and families They are doing bad job and have no sense of sympathy at all
Heiihave order some things from your site for more the 3 weeks end i have not gotit Please write me back and give me some explication
refuse to allow me to use a ticket for a flight that I had to cancel becasue of a hurricaneAfter telling me it would be good for a year and it has only been a couple of monthws
The transaction was very quick and easy Always make sure the right date is chosen Accidentally bought a ticket for the may 11th instead of may 12th and the customer service reps were no help I asked not for a refund but for an exchange so that I could attend the correct date and was denied Also when calling to ask about the policy they told me my email address was not on file and proceeded to hang up on me Quite unprofessional if u ask me
Keys were cut properly but edges hadnt been buffedextremely difficult to use as delivered

He literally said I will hurt you if u hurt me  after I slightly pressed the brake when his hands were on the wheel
Just thought I would update this review Ill leave the original below the update just to make sure you know what I was updating
So I finally got a response of sorts from this lot Apparently if I have an issue with any equipment I have to log into my account  Didnt know I had one but anyway and click returns and follow the instructions to send it back They dont do exchanges and apparently dont answer questions and you then have to order anew
Really Thats the response Oh and by the way dont bother trying to enter into an email exchange because thats from a NoReply email address
Now thats all good and fine but I have a few issues with that Firstly how do I know that if I send something back it wont end up stuck in Madrid because they refuse to accept it yes that really happened to some poor sod who is now out the money he paid for a wetsuit the money he paid to send it back to them and the wetsuit
Then secondly if I order again they will just send the same frigging thing  which is wrong on the bloody website
All I need is one question answered do you people have the short blade Jetfins as depicted in all the pictures on the website or not Thats it Nothing more If you have it can I have a pair please Ill even keep the long blades and flog them on eBay or something Just for the love of Pete answer your bloody emails like a grownup
Last time I order anything from this lot
If youre interested in the whole long story then please read below
I searched long and hard for a set of Scubapro Jetfins with the short blade and I was delighted to find a set on this website that ticked all the boxes Short blades good price  less than 100 and they even come with spring straps already installed I couldnt get the money out fast enough I ordered and awaited their arrival with bated breath
The first inkling that something was amiss should have been that the tracking email they sent had no tracking information or receipt The provided links just went nowhere I responded politely to Maria and requested updated tracking information Stony silence was the only reply
The fins arrived in good time only about 3 days after I ordered so I was really pleased with that Opened the box and inside was a pair of brand new Scubapro Jetfins with the spring straps I should be ecstatic with my purchase right
Unfortunately Im not Very disappointed that I have apparently bought myself a second pair of Scubapro LONG blade Jetfins I already have a pair and as great as they are I dont want another pair My current pair should last until my grandkids are dead and gone so another pair of the same is just a waste of money
Reluctantly I return the new Jetfins to their box and compose Maria another email to the effect that I would like what I ordered ie a set of SHORT blade Jetfins as depicted in all the pictures on their website or failing that a refund so I can continue my search
Response from them so far Nothing nada zip bupkiss
I dont mind the slight cockup with the fins If they made an error in packing I would gladly pay for the return of these and even delivery of the correct fins I suspect though that they dont have the short blades and will just continue to ignore me until I get tired of the whole thing and go away I left a one star review on their website that they will post after moderatinglike thats ever going to see the light of day One would hope that after seeing that a customer is going to post a very negative review one that they can easily fix they would at least get in touch but no
Easy fix here DiveInn Just communicate and tell me you dont have what I ordered refund my money and put the right picture on the website At the moment it is misleading to say the least If I was looking for the long blades I would no doubt have been delighted with my purchase and been singing your praises far and wide As it is I am getting more and more annoyed and am now going to be telling everyone I can to steer clear of your shop
I payed instantly with Paypal 3 hours later i got a call even on Sunday for verification It was successfull and the guy told me that i will recieve my product shortly
Its not over 4 days ago i was contacting the shop twice over email contact formular because the phone number cost a load of money 0900
I started to complain in Paypal even after 2 days no reaction from shop
Very bad experience DONT BUY
Very high commissions delivery fees etc that increase the final price of the ticket by more than 30
And you dont let the prospective buyer know about all these extras until the credir card information is not entered
This is pretty close to a legal scam
Dissapointing experience
I purchased tickets to a soccer game over 500 dollars i then received an email that the game is postponed Since I live in the US it would make no sense for me to keep the tickets I wanted to get a refund for my tickets When you look on the website there is no phone number listed to receive the refund and there is nothing in the email to state about a refund i have sent countless emails to the website to receive some type of information and i have yet to get a phone call or response This website feels like a scam and i just lost all my money and all I want is my money back I am definitely going to social media and promote that this is not a good website to use The customer service is horrible How do you not have anyone who is in the chat then when you try to look for someone is says no one is there I am beyond fed up
Ive booked a vacation for four to go to Cuba now due to work I cant make the outbound flights and have had to make separate arrangements to travel there Ive spoken to Iberia who have informed me that lastminutecom will have to help me change my flights as itll be cancelled for the return otherwise
This has now led to multiple calls and promises of call backs with no luck They simply dont care and are unwilling to help me resolve if theres a charge Im happy to pay it although Iberia tell me its down to them to assist
A holiday costing almost 6k and I feel utterly let down  Id recommend everyone to avoid at all costs

also i only got an email back about one of the two items
170122001072937141 what about the other one are either of them coming at all
The guys tore up my drywall and paint on the way up the steps I would normally be able to live with something like that however the guys left a razor knife in the open position on my living room floor We did not know that it was left there until my wife found my two yearold son with it in his hands while jumping on the couch He punctured a small hole in the couch I am happy that is the only thing that happened He could have sliced himself open  or even worse he could have fallen on it and stabbed himself while he was jumping on the couch I called customer service to speak with a manager about it and I was told I would receive a call back later on that day I never even received a call back This incident could have been very serious and the fact that your customer service representatives didnt even care enough to return my call is very offputting  My experience at the store was fantastic Paul Schober was my salesman and he was very helpful and made my experience very pleasant  I wish that the delivery experience could have been the same  I am very disappointed at how the delivery experience went The fact that I didnt even receive a call back is very unprofessional especially with a matter that could have been very serious
I had to take 4 hours of vacation time off of work for my scheduled delivery on 3617 My delivery was supposed to be 1230330 I was called at 300 and told it would be from 330530 I was then called at 605 pm and told that my table had shattered and the delivery would have to be rescheduled
First of all I had to take vacation time off from work then I sat at home all day waiting for the delivery from 1230605 Then it was never delivered
I cant take any more time off for the delivery I work 700 to 400 Monday through Friday and cannot accommodate the delivery hours especially when things like this happen
I contacted Groupon regarding a product that was not delivered and about a charge on my credit card that doesnt appear on my Groupon account Their response was were looking into it and get back to you This has been going on for more than 1 week even with repeated contact
I was hit with multiple fees AFTER I made reservations
resort fee internet fee parking fee breakfast fee etc

I have included all my payment details while booking online and it took more than 20 minutes loading and then I started again Now Im worried that the payment is processed twice
The drivers are just plain rude no way would I ever recommend them

Well your reply is misinformed also not asking for original preorder refund My phone was not locked and it was on tmobile not ATT stop your automated response and reply to my email
I booked my annual service a number of weeks in advance and arranged to take the day off work so I could be at home With half an hour left British Gas called to say that no engineer would be coming as they had been called out on a emergency call I asked that surely a different team would deal with emergencies but apparently not I was offered between 8 and 12 this Saturday but I asked Michael is they could be more specific but apparently this wasnt possible I didnt want to wait around all morning I asked to speak to a Manager and Michael said he would get someone to call me back They never did I then had to call Brit Gas back to get it arranged Very unimpressed Will leave at end of contract
I sent back ink for a refound and guess what its been over a month and no refound so no money and no ink
You pay 50 a month for an outfit but they dont allow you to customize the outfit to fit what you want All the 50 outfits are cropped leggings and tanks which I dont wear So what if you pick a 70 outfit To get the long leggings and long sleeve top but oh wait the top is a crop top which yet again I dont wear to the gym So you try to just get the leggings 50 So you try to use the promo code they are advertising for 30 off to get a little less ridiculous but still high price now you cant use your credit that you pay for every month So what is the point That is ridiculous You can get leggings that are better quality for half the price anywhere Not to mention the product is sewn wrong so now I have a gaping hole on the seam of my top From the outfit I paid 90 for VIP is not a good deal so dont fall into the trap
very poor service I need to chase up my tax invoice

Needs improvement and accurate pricing when giving a Quote to sell back peoples books

I was only unfortunate enough to deal with Eircom as part of a messy change over to Sky broadband  phone once in Co Cavan
The sheer nastiness of the customer service MANAGRESS at Eircom and her threats to extract payments for a service I never usedas I was with Sky and a completely selfish useless RUDEplain RUDE and nasty experience means that I will NEVER deal with Eircom ever again nor recommend them to any soul 
Luckily other providers have given me a far better service since then
Life is all about choice and WHO you choose to give your hardearned money to based on experience and wisdom gained
Eircom get 010  overall
10 10 for shee verbal rudeness on the phone an threatening insinuations
Overall thank GOD I never used any of their products  is all I can say
A supplier of mine showed me another web based recruiting company that has the function of typing in local company names in the same trade and you can find applicants that are looking for work within your exact trade
This is the worst experience ever They promoted low prices and hide luggage costs I went through the booking process and only after I paid I realised the luggage was not included Why Because they call it extra luggage and it is hidden in between other additional services When I emailed them to figure out what is going on they sent me to the airline company of course When I asked for a refund they also sent me to the airline company This is absolutely the worst website where you could purchase a ticket I strongly advise all of you to avoid them
To addyes you call it EXTRA luggage You would call it extra luggage when you already had the first luggage included What kind of missleading information is that Obviously you are trying to fool people with low prices
Come on this company sucks I never could redeem my 30 minutes for a dollar that I paid Maybe you can say is just one dollar But if you take 100 for thousands people now you can think also the customer care dont even know what to do They dont know nothing about the app 
I live in Canada and orders from these guys when I went to pickup the bag I was hit with a 40 charge for Customs which made it pointless to buy from them then when I went to install the bag the bracket doesnt fit even though I purchased the one for a dyna the bag it self is nothing special after the extra 40 for customs and purchase of the bracket that works I ended spending more then I would have if I just got the HD bag
I will never order from them again and I would advise anyone in Canada to steer clear
Ordered and paid 6 months before arrival Forced delivery to meet change of courier Left bath crate in front garden killing grass Took 4 weeks to pickup damaged wrong item They then lost the bath and still weeks later are unable to process refund Terrible
Ive worked with this company for five separate orders The first three were so flawless but the fourth order arrived patches and they were covered in green gook and peeling After lots of back and forth with the customer service agent and the factory they completely remade my order but the entire process took two months
For my fifth order I completely stopped getting email and text alerts they forgot or uploaded incorrect samples kept sending back samples that did not follow the edits I had requested a very simple edit to take out a detail and after two months of back and forth phone calls and emails and asking them to cancel my order only to have them beg to see my order through I finally had to cancel my order after receiving yet another sample that was just COMPLETELY wrong
I am a textile designer by trade and daily I work with multiple companies overseas and after four years in the industry I have yet to encounter any issues as difficult as the issues I had to deal with when I used the Studio
Use any other company there are so many companies that make manufactured patches in the states for a similar price
I recently purchased a Office 365 plan with them as I wanted to change my email provider for my custom domain The setup worked good and all but later I found a cheaper option But was unable to contact go daddy support until this morning because there chat is always offline and I will not call Once I finally got a support agent After 20 minutes I told them that I want to request a refund and they verified my account and then told me that I COULDENT get a refund because it was over 48 hours I have now cancelled my service and my PayPal payments and moved my email back to my original provider Very disappointed and will not do business here again Just a note the office 365 services here cost 10 PER MONTH while Microsoft WHO MADE office 365 is selling services for only 4 per month
The meals Ive had so far have unfortunately been disappointing and salmon fillet was literally inedible was like someone had emptied an out of date tin of salmon into a bag bones and all I understand it is for convenience and cant do much with reheated food though Im hopeful the meals I havent tried are better but Im reluctant to try but I will
I really hope the meals get better Its a great idea very convenient to have in the freezer and really not meant to be restaurant quality of course fingers crossed for the remaining meals
Day 13 and my contacts havent even shipped yet
I cannot make any seat reservation even if I booked these flights 3 months in advance

Just spent a lot of time working on some business card designs for MOO skinny format business cards get to the stage when im about to order it it then states almost 3 weeks to deliver really yes but guess what can deliver quicker if you pay 600 more for delivery for a little packet of 100 cards must be joking FAIL
We had a water leak over our childrens ceilings We were asked whether it was from the central heating system or hotcold water pipes We didnt know British Gas sent out Dyno the plumbing side of British Gas who visually looked at the ceilings told us it was the central heating pipes to keep the boiler off but ok for mains water to be on and they would be back in the morning Next morning my child switched her light on before we realised water was pouring out of the light switch and water was leaking above my other childs bed We turned water and electrics off but water was still leaking down We phoned up British Gas and were told it maybe several hours before they could get to us We got a private plumber out who poked out the wet ceiling to reveal a pinhole water leak in the cold pipe between jobs so they couldnt stay British Gas man then appeared but he said he had to recall Dyno as it was a water pipe not a central heating pipe Dyno man then came round and said it was an unsleeved pipe so we werent covered How do we know if our pipes hidden under the wall are sleeved or unsleeved The house was built in 1996 and it was normal to fit pipes this way apparently several years later they started to be sleeved according to a buildings reg company I know We asked if he could do anything to help He said he could cap the pipe but it wouldnt make any difference because of where the pipe was situated I asked how is it we pay 33 a month and you cant even leave us with running water He shrugged We have had Homecare  Central Heating and Plumbing since 2000 and realise we have paid for a service that cant even leave our family with running water Obviously we have had no working toilets electrics in the bedrooms or water for 2 nights two days until we found an emergency plumber British Gas have been worse than not having them Due to their incompetence we now have more water damage in our house and potentially put our family in a dangerous situation
Very slow  frustrating Too much time  hard to Navigate thru it all Terrible experience
Had ordered item in hope to receive it for St Patricks Day received an email from DPD on 1503 at 2326 stating the item would be delivered on the 1603 and that I would receive an email on the day of the timing of this Today I didnt an email giving me the details of the time of delivery and with the location of my parcel being at the Hub I decided to call up to find out about the delivery Would have had to pay charges to call the Ireland office if not for the helpful customer service I received from the UK office Im in Northern Ireland which informed me that I wouldnt receive my item today or tomorrow but rather next Monday most likely Poor service by DPD Ireland but given these other ratings I guess I shouldnt have been surprised
Ordered an online sub code to play an mmo on friday night still sat here sunday night with no reply no way to get in contact with anyone and no code to play it says there is a max 24 hour wait for these codes wont be ordered anything from this site again
I placed an order for delivery on 214 I talked to a customer service representative and sent a email requesting a full refund because they
were unable to to deliver on the requested date I was assured that I would receive a full refund As of today 221 I have not received a refund
This ends my relationship with Bake Me A Wish
This is by far the worst online experience I have ever had I made an error in one of the passengers name and after 6 weeks of emailing back and forth Im still left with the same problem and my flight is in less than 24 hours I was told I could pay a fee and the airline would fix the mistake and then that was retracted and I was told I had to pay for another ticket Stay away from using this company They cant keep their word
It was impossible to contact by phone After many attempts I was able to talk with a woman who doesnt speak correctly spanish After 35 minutes and many discussions I cancelled my reservation After this I use another webpage for my trip
Horrible service While the flowers were OK the accompanying chocolate that was delivered was TOTALLY different from what the website advertises on the web page Frustrating
I was treated terribly by the company when I went to renew this year and went with a different company When enquiring about a discount my husband was offered as a result of our recent marriage I was told that it was social convention to have changed my surname when I told them I had chosen not to change my name
I paid down a balance I owed for a Macys credit card I tried paying it online but they could not confirm my card info I did not want to call in to make the payment because I dont feel very comfortable giving financial information over the phone but had no other option I was under the impression that the card was linked with my primary checking account so that minimum payments would be made on their own but that was not the case I missed two payments and the total amount of fees was around 70 on a purchase of 90 The main issue is that they dinged my credit after I had made the payment So my complaints are the following 1 Their online payment method does not work 2 They overcharge for missed payments and 3 They dinged my credit after I had actually made the payment
clear and simple booking process
who is responsible for refunding the price of an airline ticket 
If not bravoflywhat benefit do I derive from using the service 
agent on phone was unintelligible cannot speak English
Will not be using this service againever
and will let friends and family and coworkers to not use it either
Be warned  Bravofly does not provide any customer assistance 
they just give you regrets and they are sorry it is the airlines policy so again there is no customer value derived from using this service
I had a bad expierence with a host I told them everything but obviously they have no control of hosts Both website and hosts all they care about is money
Excellent service  help with our purchase
Love the prices However you have to find your own promo code to apply And shipping is very expensive Great quality of the clothes however
Bags did not fit Customer service never responded back
I have purchased a ticket for a soccer match In the transaction screen there was no restriction mentioned and only when the transaction went through I received an email saying this was a child ticket as well as it is a season pass and I will need to return the pass once the match is over Reselling of a season pass is of course not allowed
Only explanation I get from the customer service team is they are only a platform to trade tickets Shouldnt they have made all information available if that is the case This is such a scam If I do not receive a full refund I will take this matter further
Regarding your response below the only response I received is that you are unable to assist further or cancel the order since you are only a platform Shouldnt all restrictions be disclosed on the ad before the ticket proceeds to final sale if that is the case
Also could I ask what the reason is for having an expected posting date for the ticket only two days before the actual match when the purchase date was more than 15 months before the match
Given misleading and lack of information provided ie childstudent restrictions the fact that it is a season ticket that needs to be returned to the seller after the event  which is against the season ticket rule Both were not displayed in the transaction screen before purchase was made regarding this transaction I would like to cancel the purchase Can you advise how this can be done
I signed up to switch over to Think Energy I received a confirmation number and was led to believe that within 60 days my energy rate would be locked in with this company Not only did they not switch over my account they failed to inform me that they did not switch my account I called because my supplier was still my old supplier only now I am paying an exceptionally higher rate I called Think energy and was told that my delivery company rejected switching my account This was not true as I spoke with my delivery company and they said the only thing submitted was a request for my usage records I confronted Think Energy about this and was finally told that they have a 2 month back log of requests and they would get to my account when they get to it This is no way to run a business When it comes to your electric service reliability and integrity is most important Think Twice Energy is a more suitable name
3 Days and still no response How can anyone honestly say this company is 5 Stars
As a vendor I do not like this service I get one call every month or two Maybe When I do get a call people dont want to meet or pursue anything They just want to shop tire kick use you as a spring board for looking for cheaper pricesand they certainly dont book you if they have to pay their referral fee Vendors are better off doing facebook booster ads Very cheap and brings me several dozen hits per day Its tageted at people that want my service Gigsalad does not allow you to have any outside contact with potential clients Everything has to be done through their website Which sounds great but when you or the client want to ask a simple question in a backandforth exchange it has to go through their website for Gigsalad to review What a colossal waste of time and energy and dictatorship On top of that they send you reminders of how much money you DID NOT make in the previous monthwhich tells me that this service does not work or pay Therefore I do not pay for a subscription After several months of trial It has proven useless to me

I Find the sizes you show DO NOT actually match up to the Sizes of the Goods you deliver
You sizes are about 3 Smaller than Say XXXL

So I have wasted my MONEY 
Im not impressed
I was charged weeks ago for 2 items only to have one delivered with the delivery note stating the other item is on back order This would be fine if I wasnt charged for the item that had not been sent You should only charge for an item once you can send it Other businesses do this
customer support is amazingnever have been supported so rudely and unprofessionallyI booked a work tripwhen it came to sending receipt to accountantI see that they didnt send anythingHow is that even legal
I called supportwas ensured that i will get email
After 2 daysno receipt was sent to me
I call againand just amazingI hear just i dont know anything i dont care Blamed me that i have to read rules and i dont know how to book tickets
Never met that bad service
Customer service at airport sucks Did not show us car we wondered around for 30 minutes in the sun Michael is disabled I am senior citizen We should be competed for part of this
Paid for 2nd day shipping and got it at the end of the 3rd day Then when I had to return most of the order there was no shipping label included as with most online retailers so I had to hassle with a trip to the Post Office
Now theyre refunding me the items less the firsttime discount for being a new customer which I find pretty lame
In total I think I wound up paying 60 for a 20 item when all said and done Will avoid Uncle Dans in the future
i did my shopping on jan 23rd and have not receive my order till date they are still holding on my order to check wether its eligible for free shipping or not after cancelling one of my item which i like the most and because of that item i have been waiting till now after enquiring couple of times to them through email and general enquiry they came to conclusion to cancel that item  my point is they dont care about our time n money coz if they care they would have look upon the matter a weeks before and would have shipped immediately the rest of my items which are there in the stock and cancelled that one item which is not available at all after all this  they wanted to check wether the shipping is free or not come on according to your website rules and condition  i purchased more than 100 and its eligible for express shipping i am never going to shop from this website it went beyond my patient now hope you guys ship my order asap

Literally delivered the Boquet a week early while no one was there to accept the order
Okay so i expected from the reviews that some people were just being dramatic But let me emphasize that all the 5 star ratings are robots and fake reviews
Last year i bought an arrangement for 4999 its was tiny and honestly pathetic for a floursit This year same exact boquet was 6999 I continued to give the company the benefit of the doubt and purchased it assuming the increase was due to inflation The delivery was set for Tuesday 328 Today is Wednesday 322 and according to my tracker the flowers were delivered YESTERDAY Theyre for my mothers birthday she is out of town this week and was not there to accept the order on top of that theyre gonna be dead by the time she gets home and has her birthday
They wont resend the boquet or admit their error I am required to repurchase for a wopping total of 90 including delivery charge
Theyre cheap for a reason I think only person works for them You cant call them You put in a call request and they call you hours later and if you miss it you have to do it all over again You can send one email per 24 hours and the live chat is awful Brendan actually hung up on me Great for cheap cover but truest awful If you actually need them
should include all taxes or custom or tell your customer and the worst thing it is my second time that happen but the last time
I WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE SHOULD STRIPS WITH THIS ORDER
Did I No I did not so I called I was told that I was NOT going to get them
Really BUY SOME WHERE ELSE These people dont provide what they say they are going to provide
Told them to take me of the list They did NOT and I got this email
VERY VERY BAD Ill even take back this review if they send me the should strips I DO NOT THINK THEY WILL
The dress came with a belt of some sort that wasnt included in the image online Im somewhat thick and dress runs a little small Im taking it to my tailor to remove the belt
Travelgenio has made a dramatic change in my tickets from Bologna to Denmark and now I cannot get in contact with them During a week I have tried to contact them by mail by phone via other booking companies etc with absolutely no result I am left now with 2 changed tickets which I cannot make any use of since it is totally impossible to get in touch with Travelgenio Right now my phone is cutting the line for the 4th time after having waited up to several minutes Never ever Travelgenio again
I DID contact the airlines They told me to contact you and DID NOT offer any alternatives I have now contacted you by mail and am waiting for you to cancel the tickets and pay me back my money
They werent rude it did not get to that stage They offered little help to solve our problems We had no time to argue because we had an appointment to go to The problems were  They did not have the car which was booked so we were held up leaving the Airport while trying to sort it out Their solution they provided was to give us a similar vehicle but charge us more they would not honor the agreement We still have not got our bond back 10 days since returning the car
if you dont want
 damages to your car as part of the service
 poor quality service
 pressure selling at the end charging you double the cost
 annoying customer service
 total dissatisfaction of the entire service
 At the end they will call yourself a liar
Dont waste your money on this service You send your sample in and go in into deep dark hole The only thing you hear from the is trying to sell you additional services 3 months since I sent my sample in and cant even get an answer Finally got ahold of some one who manipulates arrival dates etc and now it is going to be another 68 was They read a script Bs dont waste you time or money
Never using ever again

This is my third vehicle that I have purchased This time the vehicle I purchased came from up north I feel that if you know that a vehicle has snow or ice damage underneath it dont sale it to anyone Ive had to put the vehicle in the shop twice in 6 months Then I was told its my responsibility to insure that the repair shop contact them about fixing my vehicle What am I making payments on a LEMON for Make sure you also check your interest rates At this purchase the price of my vehicle doubled I will NEVER purchase from them again

I have been told I can not ship my hazardous items to my postcode in the Philippines The shop in the US I bought the goods from has said that Fedex ships these items to the Philippines from their previous experience I just spoke to Fedex directly and they said yes no problems they can ship them I have been communicating back and forth with the team for over 9 days now in emails and chat and I am getting nowhere They should call Fedex and confirm for themselves Also feels like their chat support team is massively disconnected from the internal operations pretty useless
After being delivered the wrong taps I then had to wait nearly 5 months for my correct taps to be delivered during this time i was given multiple dates for delivery only to be told on the phone each time they did not turn up that they do not offer delivery dates and that i was basically lying about being told said dates Finally after 5 months of phone calls and chasing up a company i spent over 1000 on taps with the correct taps turned up and the plumber fitted them only to find that the taps were faulty and you couldnt turn off either the hot or the cold water After the previous lack of customer service and the fact i had already messed my plumber around over the last 5 months with set dates of delivery he offered to replace the faulty parts locally sourced for a set price When speaking to Park Bathrooms about this they refused to do anything about the matter since in their words you have already fixed this yourself so there is no problem which absolutely shocked me Terrible service and quality of taps and I would never use them again and would advise anyone thinking of ordering through this company to avoid doing so at all costs
I tried 3 times to Login under my prior longstanding Marriott password and it didnt work Then I tried to register and set then reset password and paste conf into browser three times and it didnt work So I gave up trying to Login as a frequent user and just made a hotel reservation I found nowhere to enter my AAA status anymore I also had to call the hotel to request a Feather Free room since both my wife and I are allergic to down feathers So a BAD EXPERIENCE registering at a hotel we have used many times and will use many times again since my son lives close by

Ive had the subject cartridges for about 6 weeks  My usage is about average  My cartridges generally
last 3 months Today the black cartridge was empty and the color about 50  I received no notification
that the black was low  To say Im very disappointed in your product is an understatement  I will not
purchase an Inkfarm product again and will inform my friends of my experience
I have just had a review removed by Trustpilot  it now seems the norm that a company can have the negative review removed by stating they dont have the person who wrote the review as a customer  it totally skews the genuine rating  I used to think Trustpilot was a good thing but now I tend to look away from Trustpilot for unbiased reviews as I believe TrustPilot have given the Company in question the opportunity to be able to have genuine reviews removed  and why wouldnt they Trustpilot are a business and get paid to look after the companies which are reviewed  Think about it People
I expect they will find something wrong with this review and remove it

The interactive appliance selection process takes too long Other sites can select multiple criteria and then submit for updated results Every time I select a new option it takes a few seconds to reload the page and moves you back up to the top of the page This requires the user to scroll back down select another option and repeat the process With high speed google fiber internet the process take 56 times as long compared to competitor sites to find the results Its an easy fix
I bought a package with about 150 worth in value and I had to pay shipping AND DUTY About 27 worth in duty Why I dont understand

Hi xxx So sorry for such a delayyou bands will be out with Aus Post tomorrow Once again I apologise for such a delay Weve had major issues with shipping companies and our increase in sales these last couple months Thank you for being so patient Kind Regards xxxx  RBA
The people who run this business couldnt be any more pathetic if they tried  I own my own online business and trust me when I say YOU ARE PATHETIC If you had issues with shipping companies at least let your customers know of the delay or respond to one of their 6 emails instead of waiting over 3 weeks Thanks for your heavily anticipated resistance bands that smell like death

When I decided to buy the phone and pay for an urgent transport 14 I had my own reason This had to be a present for the 8th of February that looks to me enough prevision considering that I bought it on the 26th of January It did not arrive yet so you can imagine that it supposed to me a very embarrassing situation Its is not a 2 present that can be substituted by another
I am surprised that even buying it on the 26th of January and paying the urgent transport to have it here in 37 days the company did not deliver it yet 9th of February Now I know that I will receive it supposely as it is said in DHL on Friday 10th of February
When I received the email explaining about the Chinese New Year Holiday that I never had a notice before otherwise I could consider in a first instance to buy it or not you still had some days to deliver it on time Again it had to be a 37 days delivery If by your side theres an inconvenient with a national holiday you should make an appropriate effort to reduce your delivery to meet the dead line of your offer
This situation is completely unacceptable
broken item delivered disrespectful delivery people
Over top fees for little money i borrowed 2 thousand dollars repeatedly for years i wanted a bigger loan couldnt do it even though i never missed a payment
It took me 3 hours to wait on a line
Also be careful with booking your flight there as they can propose you a new flight but with completely different dates
So I have to pay 75 for cancellation because I thought it was the same dates  Will never use they service again
When the bulb arrives I will welcome a survey
Shuttle collection relatively efficient In a run down depot but efficient Car OK except a few bits of internal damage I dont mind the external damage as makes it less likely to be charged for something very minor
These people are thieves

A few things
1 When I first talked to them I said I was going to shop around and get back to them whenever I decided They took that as Hey lets call him every single day until he makes a decision
2 I called to set up a switch over on a Friday The guy who I talked to took my 50 payment and then said he was going to set me up He told me he would call me back when it was confirmed He never called me back I tried calling on Monday and got a bunch of people that would keep me on hold andor transfer me to a voicemail of someone I didnt know Nobody could give me answers Then when I got in touch with the original guy I spoke to he passed the blame onto someone named Amber I spent well over an hour on the phone with these people and most of them were rude
2 people that were not rude were Amber and Jackie Both ladies were extremely helpful and nice as they could possibly be Together they ended up getting me taken care of but overall a terrible first experience with this company
I was the first of 4 people booked and by the time I was ready to book the second one the fare had increased 30 dollars After being on hold forever I was told tough luck I booked the second and by the time I was done and ready to book the 3rd there was another 30 dollar increase All in about 20 minutes Shouldnt I have been able to include the other 3 by starting the reservation I wasnt done
I ordered 4 childrens books my kids were so excited Then when the package came it was the wrong books We instead received Stephens Hawkins books Which Im sure are great but a little advanced for a 4 and 7 yr old Parents you can imagine how disappointed they were right Then there isnt even a 1800  to call and speak with a real person You have to send and email I received and email stating that they didnt have a SINGLE second copy of ANY of books we ordered to resend us and that we would get a full refund I still havent seen the refund
I ordered 2 swimsuits in April 2016 They sent me a totally different product No biggie I thought Ill just send it back  get my suits It is now Feb 2017  I have not gotten ANYTHING back from them I have over 20 emails going back  forth with their customer service At one point they claimed they couldnt find my package even though I provided the dates  tracking info proving they had it Finally they agreed to a store credit By that time it had been 5 months  I didnt want anything from them anymore I asked for a refund  they waited to respond till Oct agreeing to mail me a check within 68 weeks When January rolled around I had still received nothing I emailed them for an update  They told me they didnt know why nothing was mailed yet but would have upper management look into it Its almost Marchstill no money no emails no calls They basically stole my money  they dont care

I made order and I paid extra for shipping and I did not receive anything yet


We have been working with Optima 6 months now They are not Open and honest with their fees It is 1000 to start and if they think they can help you then it is another 6995 You should know that upfront  That would be an honest Quote for their services More importantly  After we paid the second fee and gave them the addidtional Powers of Atty sent back to them overnight for quicker response They LOST US Literally  we fell through a crack and they lost us After 6 weeks and hearing nothing I called them and we had gotten lost between phase I and phase II even though we sent back docs immediately They apologized still more interest to IRS though and now I get an email of a letter they are going to send to the IRS after another 2 months with IRS codes that back up why we shouldnt owe Sounds good except that none of them have anything to do with our issue Just a stock generic letter that shows they still have not read any of the supporting documents sent in to them I am wondering if they really do have any tax professionals or just a bunch of secretaries pushing paper I would not use them again  I would seek out an independent Tax Attorney not a big company  I am stuck for now but you should pursue other avenues
No wifi no breakfast
I dont understand how these meals are made although I hae been on them for a week and I found these meals not nutritious at all
I will never use this shitty site again
1 I found the website because another site said it had the cheapest GTA 518 euro and then I decided to buy from there When they took the money it was 21 euros instead of 18 before taxes
2 I got chosen for manual review so I have to wait 24 hours
3 They asked me to put the trans number in for extra security  more time wasted
4 Now I have to wait again and I will either get banned happened to other people or they will shut up and give me the game I paid for
Dont use this site

Ive tried for weeks to place my order and have discovered an extra layer of fraud protection has prevented me from ordering using a US MasterCard from a the Bank of Montreal 1000 bulbscom only accepts US based bank cards If I present the card at a store front it works fine just not for online ordering Disappointing the thinking is not more global
And if you order the wrong thing you will have to pay for your mistakesno customer satisfaction at all i ordered a pair of wipers for my car I put in the model year and type in like you would on any other site they sent me two totally different wipers and one was missing the bolt cap i was sure thats not what I ordered as this wasnt the first time I purchased a pair of wipers for this car the representative told me I was sent what I ordered and made me feel like I didnt know what I was talking about all I wanted was a pair of wipers that fit not to mention they were all nicked up from shippingso after some long back and forth emails I kinda gave up they made me pay for the shipping back and the ones they sent were damaged again even after I specified to please wrap them in paper so that they wouldnt hit up against each other during shipping  well that was ignored and I was sent a nicked up pare that fit so after all the time and trouble I was only offered a twenty five dollar discount on my next purchase witch is kinda insultingso what I have got and learned from all this is not to ever order parts from europarts again and there is lots of competition with much better customer service and communicationlike revolve Volvo parts and FCp parts and iPd Volvo and many more others than these guys
PayPal is acting as a real mafia on eBay one owns the other
PayPal wont let you use your visa or master card if you had an account with them with PayPal
Horrible
There should be some laws against this mafia behavior
I tried several time to checkout on fabletics thru my cell phone iphone and was unsuccessful I wanted to enter my cc but was taken to a sponsored visa site Your site would not all me to bypass this option very disappointing I had to long in using my pc to complete my order Im sure you have lost business because of this error
I was told Id get a 50e cash back and didnt and also I was told I get your app for the home heating which my system of heating wasnt comparability with the sales man should have known that just wanted the sales
Booked a ticket to India and on the checkout payment page received an error So payed again and I got charged twice I had explained the issue to the customer service asking for them to refund my money for one ticket as I have 2 tickets on the same name for the same travel dates and they said they can only refund half the amount for the ticket So I say its okay refund at least half the amount They took the request and it has been 2 months now and I have still not received my refund
Tixbe has horrible customer service and very lazy people They dont take action immediately Worst booking experience ever Sky scanner should remove them from their suggestion list as Tixbe is a negative influence on their brand value
I was looking for some old components impossible to find through usual distributors to repair some devices I heard about this company and asked for a Quote 
The answer I got  We dont have stock but they still list thousands of units available through their network for the parts I requested we usually provide higher quantities to large manufacturers try Digikey which of course cant provide this and that person should know it damn well 
Interesting way to treat a customer
UPDATE Following EARIs reply I feel the need to precise a few things
1 There isnt any minimum order quantity stated on their website Not at all
2 Funny enough there are a few reviews here on Truspilot talking about small quantity orders which were fulfilled smoothly
3 When digging a bit in those reviews I see a few suspect points which let think a fair amount of them may have been written by the company itself
 There is never anything truly negative in their content even in the few that are negative
 Most of them are stated by people with a single review
 Most of them happened at a very fast rate in limited time periods
Readers will make their own opinion
Id also like to add this review has nothing to do with frustration like it is insinuated But the experience I had with this company contrasts so much with the image they want to show that I felt this needed to be known
They didnt send my order
So I should cancel it
Firstly  Their personnel is the worst Rude It takes them forever to get back to you
They dont ccare about their customers or their colleagues
I have been renting properties for a while on several major portals and one of them is tripadvisor
They would take the reviews from a property without even asking just because someone asked them
So here is how you can steal a propertys reviews on tripadvisor
 Create a free listing
 Copy any listing out there Especially a villa Download the photos and reupload them as yours Create a new description fix the prices
 Send an email to tripadvisor that the original listing should be deactivated becuase you created a new one
 When they DeActivate it send another email it never goes to the same person asking to move your reviews from the old DeActivated Listing
I had no option to choose a option to buy a bag or seat preference

Trying to book a flight for my mother in law and they say her payment was declined Tried their link for payment and never was able to confirm Tried calling their service line 4 times Each time put on hold for 6 minutes then someone just hangs up WASTE OF TIME No way to reach them and her flight was booked for tomorrow This is the last time I will book using this agency
Terrible no delivery note bo returns slip no customs slip and charge for returns
FIRST I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ORDER THE 2 LEGGINGS FOR 24 WHICH IS THE WHOLE REASON I LOGGED ON TO YOUR SITE
I FOUND SOME ITEMS I LIKED BUT IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BUY ANYTHING IN MY PLUS SIZE BECAUSE NOTHING MUCH WAS AVAILABLE IN ANY SIZE I FOUND A FEW THINGS TO MAKE IT WORTH MY WHILE BUT WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THERE WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL DISCOUNT BASED ON IT BEING MY FIRST VIP PURCHASE ADVERTISEMENT ON THE PAGE JUST PRIOR TO THE CHECKOUT
THEN IT TOOK ME 4 TIMES TO ENTER ALL MY INFO BEFORE i HAD A SUCCESSFUL PURCHASE ALL BECAUSE OF A SMALL DIFFERENCE IN AN ABBREVIATION IN MY STREET ADDRESS I THINK AND THE EXP DATE OF MY CARD WHICH i EDITED 4 TIMES AND IT WOULDNT TAKE FOR SOME REASON
VERY FRUSTRATED AND NOT LOOKING TO RETURNING EXCEPT MAYBE TO DELETE THE VIP PROGRAM FROM MY RECORDS
If I could show you pictures youd understand I ordered 6 photo frames as gifts for my wedding party all engraved with the date of our wedding I chose the classic script font but the font I received is unlike anything scripted or even elegant for that matter Not only does the font not match the example given it doesnt match any font they have available on their website Its like the engraver felt like they had creative control and ruined the whole thing I was going for I will probably never use this service ever again
DO NOT BUY FROM THEMOrdered two bar stools  on delivery one had tear in leather so obviously they were selling substandard goods as new Cost 56  they offered 6 off price  I tried repeatedly to get a return arranged no cooperation Eventually returned goods to the despatch address by tracked yodel but they then said not received Complained to e bay but they said the return address was wrong one they repeatedly failed to supply one took so long to sort with Chinese New Year  E Bay time ran out  Lost all the money  VERY BAD COMPANY 
I booked tickets for my kids to come home from BC to Toronto for my dads funeral I had to change a few things then I found out that the ferry they needed to take to get to the airport decided they were not doing a return run So I called and explained all this I tried to get them on another flight but it took ALL DAY to try and get this company to return my calls When I would speak to someone they said they had to call me back which took hours Now I am trying to cancel the flights which means my kids dont get to say goodbye to their grandfather and they will not refund the money they will take 500 for a fee but said we would get West Jet credit Only problem is my mom paid for these tickets and they will only give credit to the ticket holders which are my children Now my mom is almost 82 just lost her husband of 62 yrs and now she has lost 300000 because of this company NO COMPPASSION FROM THESE GUYS And I have been dealing with this ALL FREAKIN DAY My dad died and this is how I have to spend my day WOW not good customers service at all
This was my most awful encounter with selling books back Sold back in January still no check
We needed to amened our flights and hotels by 2 days Web jet charged us approx 33 of the cost of the flights to make the changes Webjet told us that they could not change the hotel booking dates and suggested that we call the hotel and ask the hotel to change the dates We called the hotel and they said the change was OK by them but as we had booked via Webjet we had to do the change via Webjet So we are about 2000 out of pocket because of Webjet
